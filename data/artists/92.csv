0,.38,2011,Thug Motivation 103: Hustlerz Ambition (2011),,Young Jeezy,"I don't think they know the time [x5]
Heard the streets fucked up, I can see the sign
Heard they going for the 30 straight
I can't lie, man that shit got me 38
Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire
Ooh oh, your boy back
And he way to flashy, got my toys back
Nigga I just left the lot, I ain't come to play
He pull me from my dealer tag, fuck you trying to say
Know some niggas doing 10, blame it on the yay
Clip hold half a hundred, blame it on the K
Still the realest nigga any, these niggas CB4
This is fuck a nigga records, and I'm the CEO
Got them stack long and wide, like some Lego blocks
Say you need a real home, this my lego spot
You ever seen so much money in a duffle bag?
Soon as you open up the ship, the bitch will double brag
I don't think they know the time
Heard the streets fucked up, I can see the sign
Heard they going for the 30 straight
I can't lie, man that shit got me 38
Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire
I'm in that purple Lam', looking like some dirty Sprite
Catch them bastards with them birds, yeah that rowdy white
Where I'm from them things hot, and that talk is cheap
And ain't nobody hearing shit, 'cause they trying to eat
All they can eat, buffet style
Nigga selling anything, buffet wild
DB9 stupid grill, yeah that overbite
Need me 9 stupid deals, this shit is overpriced
Got it vacuum sealed up, that's the hide the scent
So much that if they pull you over, smell it through the vent
If them people hit them lights, I be a nervous wreck
When you don't fear nothing but the lights, now that's a nervous check
I don't think they know the time [x5]
Heard the streets fucked up, I can see the sign
Heard they going for the 30 straight
I can't lie, man that shit got me 38
Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire"
1,1/4 Block,2014,Seen It All: The Autobiography (2014),,Young Jeezy,"I remember being posted up on the 1st and the 3rd
Just re'd up, nigga got a 9 piece
All the while fantasizing, visualizing, comin' through in a Benz
With a dimepiece
Audemar what that time piece say
Audemar what that time piece say
Know it ain't shit, swing by the Federal boot camp
Shit, whip it like it's cream brulee
Straight drop that glass, whipped cream, watch them eat it up like dessert
Broad day, call it Draya
Almost caught me on the camera nigga makin' it twerk
'Magine me with the Kenmore stove
With the Pyrex goin' berserk
Show up in the khaki Dickies suit, with the Tims on like ""I'm going to work""
That quarter block
All about getting that quarter block
Started with the rocks in a slab
Then I moved up on the Ave
Hit them up with that quarter block
Yeah, that quarter block
All about getting that quarter block
250 straight, 9 piece straight drop
Yeah, I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with a quarter block
I'm the undisputed track king, talkin' straight cash shit like Mayweather
I was 15 on The Money Team, whip a nigga ass like Mayweather
Young nigga, 14 for the half from the big homie, didn't know better
Old niggas taxing didn't stop shit, 'cause a young nigga got mo' cheddar
This work shit is in my resume
Brand new chickens all day like I'm Chick-Fil-A
Spot open up, weed given on the weekend
Even on Sunday unlike Chick-Fil-A
Don't you want a 9 piece wing my nigga?
Lowkey, tryna be seen my nigga
Run through the check, that's the protocol
34 walls, threw 'em a promoter dog
That quarter block
All about getting that quarter block
Started with the rocks in a slab
Then I moved up on the Ave
Hit them up with that quarter block
Yeah, that quarter block
All about getting that quarter block
250 straight, 9 piece straight drop
Yeah, I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with a quarter block
Said I'm sitting here
Staring at the bottom of this Visionware
And I swear I can see my dreams
As the water boil, see a little clearer
Eyes red, nigga might need some Visine
Game got a nigga head throbbing, nigga might need some Advil
Feds picked up my nigga and his baby mama
Last night shit was mad real
Scared to go to church
Throw him an iced out cross, then I hit the club
Threw both hands over both my eyes in the court room so I can't see the judge
I made miracles with that soda babe
Decibels with that yola babe
Cash Money in my projects, since a Juvenile
Like the Nolia baby
That quarter block
All about getting that quarter block
Started with the rocks in a slab
Then I moved up on the Ave
Hit them up with that quarter block
Yeah, that quarter block
All about getting that quarter block
250 straight, 9 piece straight drop
Yeah, I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with a quarter block

That's why I gotta say it again, pussy bananas
My little cool ass bitch, she from the Westside
She let me hit from the back, say that's her best side
Call it her bed side, I call it her wet side
And every time the bitch cum, she holler, ""Westside!""
One Thursday night, met her at Crucial's
You already knowing the rest, the head was crucial
Do this little thing with her tongue that get me so hype
You should see her lips when I'm done, them shits be so white
Nothing ain't soft in my pants, that barrel so long
Each and every time that she call, that shit be so hard
She know what to do, and she know how to do it
How I get her done every time we do it
Ain't gotta ask, baby, getting right to it
Box of Swishers, box of Magnums, running right through it
All we do is smoke and fuck, smoke and fuck
All we do is smoke and fuck, smoke and fuck
All we do is smoke and fuck, smoke and fuck
All we do is smoke and fuck, smoke and fuck
Yeah, you know it's on after the club, no problemo
Got no problem getting it up, I'm all limo
Yeah, like a black-on-black super-stretch
Trying to break that back, we had super-sex
She say all dick is the same, I got a super one
Told her all pussy's the same, she got a super one
And when I'm on that trick, I'm going superman
And when I'm on that smoke, I'm going super-HAM
Make a quick stop and a run for blunts and po'boys
When you left your strap in the car? The answer's no, boy
In my wife-beater and boxers, left on my damn chain
Before I left, I put her to sleep - don't play no damn games
Yeah, you know our conversation is cool, she intellectual
Got turned out at the school, she bisexual
Show up with my game face on, ready to kill something
Man, that thing get so wet, you think you spilled something
She said she can be anything if we arrange it
She said, boy, you better get back, it's bout to rain here
She said, Young, since this your pussy, let's put your name here
Baby girl, since this your crib, let's hide some 'caine here
Think about the business side of it, we both can gain here
Yeah bitch, I know this your shit, we both can hang here
I told her, listen here, that's my shit so let me hide that
She said, listen here, that's my dick so let me ride that"

Told her strike a pose
Step to the side and look at them thighs
That bitch beautiful
I got a Lambo, two doors
Two seaters, two hoes
Yokohamas, no Vogues
Man, that bitch beautiful
Champagne fountains, crib in the mountains
2-mile-long driveway
Man, that ho beautiful
I got a condo up in the sky
'Fore I fake it, I'd die
Foreign bitch, no lie
Man, that bitch beautiful
Came up in the projects, dreamin' 'bout them mansions
Wit' the coke white walls, flow like bowlin' balls
Murci in my garage, course it is supercharged
Wake up to a ménage, they give me a massage
Closet filled wit' designer, Donatella recliner
Suede headliner, all that whip in china
I ain't talkin' Sprite when I say I need soda
Bought my first Caprice, put fifty in the motor
Bricks they was beautiful, yeah, Mona Lisa
The streets introduced me to money, nice to meet ya
Ray Charles in these Ray Bans, why?
Touched them keys with both hands?
If I die, remember me like Don Killuminati
Bury me on the left, right next to John Gotti
Play nothin' but that Cocaine Muzik, that Yo Gotti
Tombstone ready, took shit from nobody
I got a bad bitch from Vogue
Told her strike a pose
Step to the side and look at them thighs

Tell me which Lambo I should park at the L'Ermitage
Pull up at the The Mirage, it's Phantom's and Mazi's
Out here, expensive taste, my car is camouflage
Speakin' of camouflage, RIP to Camoflauge
Just drove through Savannah, Georgia
That shit beautiful, and his .45 is unusual
Push your shit back like nail shops do cuticles
Snowman, tell these niggas that we livin' it
Front yard like a soccer field, and we kickin' it
Sick condos, pockets full of Rondos
Choppers wit' extended clips, long as El Segundo
Jeezy like Versace, so we rented out the mansion
Fuckin' European models, skin white as Marilyn Manson
Came a long way from a nigga first advancement
Test drive the new Bugatti, hold that bitch for ransom
I keep me a jet model
Keep a black bottle
Meal ticket wrapped in plastic
That bitch beautiful
Keep some rose gold on my arm
Bottle of Avion
FNH with the drum
Man, that bitch beautiful
Baby girl she out of Broward
Smoove with powder
Tats on her neck, straight checks
That bitch beautiful
I got a condo up in the sky
'Fore I figured I'd die
Foreign bitch, no lie
Man, that bitch beautiful
My Chevrolet a seven trey
Dade County dopeboy, I'm talkin' heavyweight
I hustle everyday
We squashed the beef to get the money
We set examples for rich niggas in Maserati's
My killers in the lobby
Bitches keep my name ringin' (Boss!)
Execute a nigga; Abe Lincoln
200 squares for the same ticket
Out in LA, I'm with my main bitches
Tiptoein' on marble, got me trippin' on these pain killers
I'm still the same, I never changed, nigga
Went from razorbladin' rocks, no more holes in my socks
Fuck her like a champ, got me livin' like I box
Sugar Ray Leonard, nigga, I just want the drop
First nigga with the Wraith, underneath the stars
Better look me in my face, tell the tears' for my dogs
Fuckin' the same hoes, but we got them different cars
Ugh! Beautiful, are my odds
I got a bad bitch from Vogue
Told her strike a pose
Step to the side and look at them thighs
That bitch beautiful
I got a Lambo, two doors
Two seaters, two hoes
Yokohamas, no Vogues

Steady mobbing be the game
Cut the music down cause my cellphone ringing
From what I just heard think my cellphone dreaming
Wasn't doing this I'd probably be a politician
Fuck first forty-eight just too much snitching
'Cause I ain't pulling over be a whole lotta arresting
What?
Ain't a damn thing change now
'Cause I been getting money
Who you know pulled up
Black cars drewed up
With the big-faced hundreds
Put them things on the road now
Nigga still getting that dough now
Niggas think I lucked up, must got me fucked up
'Cause I been getting money
And just when I thought it couldn't get no better
Nigga hit me on my chirp, got all my cheddar
All wondering why I got this shit runnin' like a shower
Big bag full of white, you woulda thought it was some flour
Work hard in the kitchen like a culinary school
I be doin' my thang, I'm a culinary fool
So much Pj, I was pissin that shit, talkin' bottles so big put a fist in that shit
You were born that way, always be a hater
Don't (?) on these hoes, always be a playa
(???) Shoulda been a calculator
I'm so cold with this shit, (?) refrigerator
Jewelry store, green bob bought my first Cartier
Threw 'em 30 thou and got the fuck up outta there
That's how jo jo (???) one day got indicted
If it's a party with the feds, I ain't tynna get invited
Ain't a damn thing change now
'Cause I been getting money
Who you know pulled up
Black cars drewed up
With the big-faced hundreds
Put them things on the road now
Nigga still getting that dough now
Niggas think I lucked up, must got me fucked up
'Cause I been getting money
Imagine (?) coming from the ceiling fast
Stack a hundred bills in your right hand
Right there by the couch bag of rubber bands
Gotta get 5, double stacked that's a hundred grand
Rose gold jacob, 4 units for the timepiece
Got my niggas working so much they need a timesheet
They thought it was a joke until I copped that 6
7: 45 pull up in that bitch
Ever see a nigga pop a hundred bottles for the club
(???), Get the money, get ya love
One song, blew a quarter chicken, yeah that's a (?)
If a nigga re'ing up with half a ticket that's a car quote
Ain't a damn thing change now
'Cause I been getting money
Who you know pulled up
Black cars drewed up
With the big-faced hundreds
Put them things on the road now
Nigga still getting that dough now
Niggas think I lucked up, must got me fucked up
'Cause I been getting money"
11,Beez Like,2014,Seen It All: The Autobiography (2014),,Young Jeezy,"Time for the fallen soldiers
Can't have a war without casualties, you know?
For everybody goin' through the struggle, you know
Real shit everyday, everyday shit is real
(Every hood, every ghetto, every block, every trench)
I know how you feel, yeah, look
I been out here grindin' so long
But still I had to find my way on my own
I could tell you what it beez like
I could tell you what it beez like
I'm a true hustler, all that I know
So I can make it anywhere that I go
I could tell you what it beez like
I could tell you what it beez like-like, beez like
Straight from the hood, got a get money fetish
Pocket full of green, nigga, like a head of lettuce
Put the work in a bag, make a yayo sandwich
Then we go and spread it through the hood like Manwich
One thing about it, we gon' get this bread
When you knew shit was real? When they found a rat dead
Right around the corner where us young niggas hustled at
Right by the stop sign, that's where they was bussin' at
When you come here with nothin', gotta learn how to provide
Carlo had a Benz 'fore he was old enough to drive
Losin' 10, 20 every night, gamblin' ain't nothin'
And ya nigga got killed takin' up for his cousins
When you knew shit was real? Drop outfit in the feds
Still 8 years and a nigga shot him dead
On the humbug, left him slumped in his car
Everybody got a day, don't matter who you are
Stove water, heat cold water
Knew I'd touch a bird when I got my first quarter
Sell water to a well, nigga
Cold nights, cold hearts, tough love, that's what it be like in jail, nigga
Mama crying at my visit 'cause she care for me
Daughter just had her period, ain't there for her
Know how to have a girl you know just gon' hold ya back
But the pussy so good you keep goin' back
Hurt when ya main man turned rat
Make the whole la familia turn hot like that
Any city, any block, any boulevard
I survive, no lie, I'm a ghetto boy
I could tell ya 'bout the dos and don'ts
I make it anywhere I go, so lose I won't
I can tell ya 'bout the hard time when ya really need it
Been grindin' so long, still had to call Jeezy
Straight from the bottom, tryna make it to the top
What the gov'meant don't give you, gotta get it from the block
Feel like a bad boy cause this shit don't stop
Street so dirty, need a muhfuckin' mop, uh oh!
Lil homie, stay focused, handle ya business
Don't talk to them niggas around you, might be a witness
Don't tell the dishwasher what you did wit' ya dishes
Don't tell these snitchin' niggas what you did wit' ya riches
Niggas is hopin' they see Christmas
But, if we just happen to don't, we hope you miss us
Santa raised all seven them kids, didn't miss a meal
She work them fingers right to the bone, didn't miss a bill
Niggas (?), let's make a deal
See, one thing bout countin' this money, it make ya feel
See, I used to get 'em right from the source, got 'em direct
The same nigga that had a connect, he in the set"

Active little nigga, should I stayed in some beef
Lucci go through some real shit and he really need me
And what about the streets, shit they need me too

We'll bring you further details as they become available

So you can't take nothing for granted
And don't take granted for nothing
So I gotta thank god for waking me up this morning

Please lord forgive me for
Every Gram I sold
Every glock I popped

Will catch them hoes later, stay on your grind
Got a low tolerance for ignorance
You think it's pleasure, I think its business
The streets didn't raise no fool
When you live by the code nigga there's only one rule
Got the phone call, had a funny feeling
Told him everything was cool, that I was chilling
We used to chill out and smoke blunts
And I ain't seen him in awhile, maybe a couple months
He said he wondered why he seemed anxious
First thing on my mind is go and get the stainless
Make his folks pay a ransom 'bout him
On that bullshit, make a good example out of him
This nigga hot, he on fire

20,Done It,2008,The Recession (2008),,Young Jeezy,"Guess whos back in da building, mind on a million an some bitch from decater
She be holding my cash and I be holding her down
She be holding my work and I be dicking he down,
Just got a call from the other side of town,
Said he tryna come up, the opposite of down,
Just hope you ain't the feds nigga ima do me,
Said he comin' rite back
He gone need another three, two planes, four birds
One nigga ooh wee, Mr. 17.5, yeah you know shawty low
Anythang bout to blow bitch ask shawty
Know, now all the real bitches say go shawty goooo,
Now I'm black tee wearing hell naw I ain't caring
And I'll wreck this bitch and come back in a maclaren,
You know da feds stareing, and I ain't even caring,
I left my 87's off nigga show them wat I'm wearing.
I done' done it all, Next city, ice, strokes, chevys, benz's, Ferrari's, Fo'ces.
You ain't never in your life seen a nigga this focused
And done done it all in a pair of air forces [2x]
If it's a UFO then it's the FBI so I'm O-U-T nigga don't call me, that's yo hot ass they really don't want me, now your own ass got them all on me, so nigga worry 'bout you why you all on me? big stacks big straps yeah that's all on me, you at it wit my city then it's all on me, if I'm at it wit your city then it's all on me,
New jail new cell old news, gotta new grind, myspace, youtube, smoke plate,
Pretty nigga big food, a good blunt tryna fie up like quick food,
Talkin' about the whole, and you don't even know but half,
I'm talkin' lumpkin, dumpkin, an mac-nabb, yeah my partner got arrested I got a new lexis, I drove my new lexis to get a new necklace.
A real nigga on top y'all should be glad to see let me ask y'all a question
And don't you laugh at me, come things first but I don't knoe why,
Take them out the cage and they still wont fly,
Take them out the flap and they still wont sell,
Take them out ten times and they still gon' smell,
You can get a good lawyer but he still gone tell,
And you can fix a car and it's still gone fail,
I done did some business with mariah, lupee, usher,
Same ol j.young ain't no buster, never said I was a usher,
So how you gone sit an tell me I ain't no hustler,
I got bitches all round me young like usher,
Don't leave your bitch around me young might fuck her,
Catch me in the club baby, me and my shooters,
In a white drop top, hooters, broad day big bag, getting money, 5 grand we had...
Rent money, real nigga till I die, get money, 20 in advance tip money."

(Verse one)
Born September 28
My life far from great
No food on the table
So we far from steak
But I'm so close to jail
It feels like I'm so close to hell
Moms smoking rocks
Same shit I'm selling
So whos wrong
Her or me
She addicted to the high
I'm addicted to the cash
I almost put my hands on her
When I caught her in my stash
How could I do her like that
Lord knows I'm wrong
Why would I do her like that
Lord know she strong
I know it's been hard
But we made it baby
10 years clean
So she's still my lady
I must be dreamin'
""Dreamin"" (I must be)

Man I must be dreamin' ... dreamin' (yeah)
(Verse three)
I was young and dumb
Wit a pocket full of cash
Posted on the block
Wit a pocket full of glass
Full speed
Still runnin' from my past
But its starting to catch up
Yeah its gainin on my ass
There's two types of niggas
Predator and prey
I'm a predator
I pray 3 times a day
Mat lue once said
One day you'll have kids
And how you gon explain
All that shit you did
I'm a soul survivor
Far from a crook
She always said
I was a lot smarter than I look
So I took my dreams
And made it some thousands
And took my life and made it an album"
22,Enough,2014,Seen It All: The Autobiography (2014),,Young Jeezy,"If you grind strong enough
If you grind long enough
If you grind hard enough
Oh Lord, I woke up this morning and started praying
And only niggas feeling my pain, know what I'm saying
Dear Lord, street life ain't no game, know what I'm saying
It's for my money really, fuck the fame and I ain't playing
See I passed the rock a couple of times, let me assist
Nigga me and y'all together how the fuck we gonna miss
Nigga all we worry about is how the fuck they gonna flip
Cut the window drop things, I swear to god they gonna trip
Meet the haters meet the feds, now that's gotta be a sign
Smoked a blunt and laughed about it, writing lose my mind
Hit the booth and spazzed out, almost lost my mothafuckin' mind
Bought a mic for these hoes, you know my mothafuckin' grind
Sleep is the cousin of death, and I'm alive
Thug Motivation plus inspiration equals survive
They tryna rob me of this success with no disguise
I know that shit was hard on you Young (?)
(If you grind hard enough)
You can stack a few mil' nigga make it out the streets like me
(If you grind strong enough)
You can be a trap star nigga be on TV and keep it G
(If you grind long enough)
You can take care of your nephews and your nieces and your moms and your girl
(If you grind hard enough)
You can stand on top and tell these hatin' ass niggas It's Tha World
I'm on deck, on point, I'm straight, I'm cool
Got the whole 500, drop dead old school
Live by the G Code nigga, I don't break no rules
And when I was in the streets I ain't see no dues
All I know, come through use the kitchen do the dishes
Rock hard say your prayers say your muhfuckin' wishes
Jizzle what you do you sick of hopping out a 'Coupe
Cop a four door nigga hop up out it in a suit
Giorgio Armani, still represent the struggle
I'm in Giorgio Armani, still represent the hustle
See a man made the clothes, clothes never made the man
And if a nigga tell you different he ain't seen a hundred grand
All I heard is what I couldn't do, All I heard is what I couldn't be
Yet I'm still determined on these niggas, just look at me
Sometimes I lay up in my bed, think till my head hurt
Fuck raps I'd rather stress, yeah we call that bad work
(If you grind hard enough)
You can stack a few mil' nigga make it out the streets like me
(If you grind strong enough)
You can be a trap star nigga be on TV and keep it G
(If you grind long enough)
You can take care of your nephews and your nieces and your moms and your girl
(If you grind hard enough)
You can stand on top and tell these hatin' ass niggas It's Tha World
Okay now fuck that bullshit, get off ya muthafuckin ass
You working with yourself you grind that muthafuckin half
And when you grind that half you pay your muthafuckin staff
And then you take the hood you do muthafuckin math
Fuck that ho bullshit, get off your muthafuckin ass
Get off your fuckin' ass nigga stack your fuckin' cash
And when you stack your cash you pay your muthafuckin staff
And then you take the world you do the muthafuckin math

Ain't scared of none of y'all, so you know my aim good
Blowin' bin Ladie in my Porsche 911
Just left Ground Zero, on my way to kush heaven
Can't slow down, too much evil in my rear view
Sometimes you wanna scream to God, but he can't hear you
And even if you did, this'll probably be disaster
Fuck you 'plainin' 'bout? It ain't like you got cancer
Do it for my niggas on the block that got it worse
First the love, then the hate, that just a trap nigga's curse
I betcha feel like the whole world hatin' on you
But what's the hold-up? The whole world waitin' on you

That I could chill here in this big penthouse
All elevator'd up, black hardwood floors
Just to sit around and feel like it ain't yours
Your conscience gotcha feelin' like you done somethin' wrong
But the flatscreen say ""Motherfucker, we on.""
Pardon me, nigga, do you see this view?
See Ruth's Chris from here, what the fuck's wrong wit' you?
Lookin' at my Rollie, yeah, it's almost seven
Bill Gates state of mind wit' an automatic weapon
You might 'member from puttin' on for the city
Or back when it was on two, goin' for the fitty
Opened up a few squares, opened up a few tours
Just to show niggas keys open up doors
""Oh, we don't fuck wit' Young no mo'."" Why not?

Fuck wit real niggaz that'll cut ya throat
And they don't drink Pepsi they just sell Coke
All I do is talk dro it's like my brain on drugs
See me out nigga I do my thang in clubs
Listen up Jeezy gotta a little riddle
Stack of 20-dollar bill two bands in the middle
All the gangstas they gon ride to this

This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, and

My chain for yo life we can swap it out
The hoes love my voice
Make they pussy moist
Certified g shit and I'm the gangsta's choice
Niggaz popping off hope they bullet proof
Leave holes inside ya like a sunroof
Mack 11 in the club and a sub nose
Swear to God knock you niggaz out ya clothes
Lay ya ass flat like a doormat

Somebody call the weed man
I'm tryna get high
(Young Jeezy)
Woke up in the fits [?], damn sun in my face
Racks on my jeans, gun still on my waist
And I ain't leaving shit in my cup, that's such a waste
You know I'm sipping on that straight like that ""oh, what a a taste!""
Tip the valet 100 dollars to stunt
Pulled up in that mean machine, leave it up front
This passed out thing beside me, I barely know her
But you can just imagine the shit I'm 'bout to show her
Snow way, them streets too cold
Expectations out of this world, I'm thinking solar
That's why I do it for that Kalamazoo
And then NOLA, cause that's what happens
When you learn to mix it with that soda
I need some weed now
Somebody call the weed man
I'm tryna get high
(Snoop Dogg)
I wake up just to bake up, get my cake up and rise up
Motivating factors that I'm liver than most
I boast and bang, pour some pain in that thing
Put some purple rain on your brain, unravel the flame
Maintain my fame, get you new pictures
Just to put in your frame
We in the hood blowing kush with The Game
Foot in the cane, walking just like I'm an Indian chief
With no beef, real brief, with a wreath
You may think it's a leaf!
With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth
When you smoking with the dogg, shit, you might not eat!
It's ok, 'cause we lay, in the cut, on the hill, on the dip
With a fit on Crip, don't trip
I need some weed now
Somebody call the weed man
I'm tryna get high
(Devin The Dude)
The coffee that I had, it was good to the last drop
But now I'm fresh out and you know it don't... stop
So please man, somebody call the weed man
I'd call mine, but he's been low on herb even
I'm fiending, daydreaming of the times when I had
Much mota, many different kinds in the bag
I fell hard for the funk, I can't fake the love
I smoke dro, good Reggie, smoke shake to nugs
If it's weed, then I'm with it
You got a paper? Then twist it? Got a bowl? Fill it?
Got a blunt?
Let me split it down the gut
But shit for what? Cause ain't no green on the scene
Man, what the fuck?
I need some weed now
Somebody call the weed man
I'm tryna get high"
32,Holy Ghost,2014,Seen It All: The Autobiography (2014),,Young Jeezy,"Touch someone else and say, I'm still on fire
I'm under attack, but I'm still on fire
I got some chatter, but I'm still on fire
I got some threat, but I'm still on fire
I got some liabilities, but I'm still on fire
If it's not amazing that I'm on fire
I've been to hell and back, but I'm still on fire
What's in the back of my mind, sittin' in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin' in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, that's what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin' heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you don't have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin' for draws and now there's plaques on the walls
Think I'm sellin' my soul? Then you can come get 'em all
Trade 'em all for my dawgs, yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I don't have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But it's real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didn't deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look it's somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile
I'm talkin' real luxury, don't feel a bump in the road
We ain't like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin' it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddin'? It felt like a heart attack
'Cause I gave you my heart and didn't ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everybody in this world as long as we have each other
Woulda done anything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin' large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I ain't tell you to blow it, I ain't tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yeah, I know it can stress ya
But you're only a man, homie, I can't be mad at ya
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em
And when you made it that far, you should be makin' a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin' the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I swear to Lord as my shepherd I'm 'bout to go cop a Lexus
I'm 'bout to go fuck Alexis, take this and flood my Rolexs
This black on black is a blessin'
Black on black crime on my weapon
I protect mine on my mama and 'em, these my Usher confessions
Let it burn - Tee-Tee and Tiana sexting
Teepees and mansions I rest in
Two T's and Top Dawg impress with
TV's that play their investment
K-D-O-T go tee off and TG's and YG's gon' press it
It's our turn - I pray that I never lose you
'Cause I like benji and boocoo bucks at my wrists
They do voodoo, curse you forever, you better not touch it
The clutching I'm used to, 250 speed racing crucial
Nigga, Vrrrrm
(Check that homie out, homie, that's K.Dot)
My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful
It's hard to say when I'm neutral, I'm tryna find out myself
Find inner peace inside heaven, find diamond pieces in hell
Will I burn
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ain't nobody gave us nothin', so we drug dealin'
You know we coppin' Louie loafers just to thug in 'em

33,How I Did It (Perfection),2014,Seen It All: The Autobiography (2014),,Young Jeezy,"Get gone and get with it, hate it or love it
I can't even lie man, sometimes I'm like fuck it
This should be addition, these niggas subtractin'
And why I'm so tense, man, I should be relaxin'
Remember times on the highway with them ten
Done it all the best, 'cause I've never seen the pen
Still do it for the streets 'cause they taught that boy a lesson
You done it how I did it, man, they call that shit perfection
I'm from a small hood, but I had big dreams
My uncle Robert taught me how to use the big beam
That was right before he caught his life sentences
Do what you gotta, just put your life in it, (hey)
Me and (?) in this jeep, we on the road
All I saw was red and blue lights, I thought he told
Butterflies as we going through this roadblock
Ask yourself questions like (is this where my road stop?)
I'm tryna be cool, this nigga nervous
He sweatin' like a two dollar whore in Sunday Service
Got at least two blocks of hard back in this bitch
Right now I'm thinkin' we should've better packaged this shit
God works in mysterious ways and yes He do
Said ""Mister that's a nice Cherokee"" and they let us through
So, don't get to talkin' these records, I sold millions
3.5 (?), I bought billions!
Get gone and get with it, hate it or love it
I can't even lie man, sometimes I'm like fuck it
This should be addition, these niggas subtractin'
And why I'm so tense, man, I should be relaxin'

Done it all the best, 'cause I've never seen the pen
Still do it for the streets 'cause they taught that boy a lesson
You done it how I did it, man, they call that shit perfection
Hit my nigga up on the chirp, said ""What's the ticket?""
24 extra 5, nigga show you how to whip it
This (?) is so deep, I'm talking so deep!
I'm the king of the kitchen now, this is my sink
I'm the king of the kitchen nigga this is my stove
That's why I got my own lane, bitch I made my own road (That's right!)
Now I'm movin' weight like a trainer and a diet
Used to put the work in a bag and then I tie it
Flashbacks I can't deny, but you tell them police ass niggas ""Bitch I'm retired""
That's why I do it for the ones in the street, ones in the cage
All the shit I'm goin' through, I should be askin' for a raise
Don't get to talkin' this work, I made millions
Get gone and get with it, hate it or love it
I can't even lie man, sometimes I'm like fuck it
This should be addition, these niggas subtractin'
And why I'm so tense, man, I should be relaxin'

I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

I said I do I do I do I do I do
(You know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(Verse 1 - Young Jeezy)
I said now what it is, what it do, homegirl ain't got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up, flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who's ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it's us against the world
You know we both hustlin' so hustlin' is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I'm in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me 'cause it's the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you'll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you'll ring the alarm
And every time you give it to me it's gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets you're gon' be my lucky charm

Life's a bitch but she's the only love that I know -ow -ow
So la-a-dee, after the ""I Do's"" let's do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby
Looking back, I don't know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And till the task force roll
To hug her every corner till I get ash from the cold
Or until I've amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever
Your secret's I treasure, for better or worse
You'll always be my first love till death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up

Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like ""love""
""Friend,"" ""rock star"" and ""So and so's a genius""
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooh momma's sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit ain't gon' fall too far from tree
So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil' cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby, she'll be nerdy make the whole club swoon
She'll love books and cook and look just like you
And when she's done being young, she'll dress like you
We'll call her Love 22, she'll tote a 22, the laser version

Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap
Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy bout his paper
'Cause Jeezy like to shine."
40,Just Like That (What I Do),2011,Thug Motivation 103: Hustlerz Ambition (2011),,Young Jeezy,"Just like that, niggas don't know how to act
Bet when them niggas hear this they get to grabbing they strap
Just let them DJ, they know
They get to bringing it back
Them niggas hit up the club, they get to bringing the set
I said, now just like that, bitches don't know what to do
And when we hit up the club, you know them broads coming through
I told her hit up her girl, tell them that they can come too
And now that bitch off the chain, I told y'all then what I do
I say now just like that
Bitches they screaming, I can hear bitches calling
Give a fuck if they like it, tell them niggas I'm balling
These niggas holding they nuts
As you see I ain't stalling
Swear these niggas a trip
As you see I ain't falling
They want me trip on my strings
Want me fall on my face
Hit a lick for a hundred and it fell in my safe
Sexy, no alcoholic, but she drink like a toilet
Told her do me a favor and put your mouth on this faucet
I know just how she like it
She might think I'm a psychic
Even called me a plumber, she like the way that I pipe it
Niggas talk like they know me, they must got me mistaken
Bitch, I'm pleading not guilty, you'll never charge me with faking
You see my back on my shit, you can tell I'm swagging
And you know that I got it, you can tell I ain't bragging
Them Rollies wit' big faces, drink Ciroc by the cases
I'm Neo out this bitch, feel like I'm stuck in the Matrix
I'm talking so much white, you would think I was racist
See I came from the bottom, I'm talking under the basement
Threw the roof off this bitch like we just had a tornado
Desert Eagles, they twins, I call 'em Cain and Abel
Hundred K in my pocket, that shit as thick as a Bible
Superstar in my hood, so that would make me an idol
Had a hell of a night, so I'ma say me a prayer
In the lockout I'm balling, so that would make me a player
I got 'em bouncing and leaning, I got 'em drinking and smoking
I told her take off her clothes
What she say? That she open
If you're getting to the money, my nigga, ball like a dog
Them cigarillos so big, them bitches look like they logs
I'm the life of the party, bring the party some life
You know I'm dead-ass serious. Why? 'Cause I said it twice
We talking straight suicide, we taking shots to the head
Must be drinking amnesia, 'cause I forgot what I said
Stack up so much bread I'ma need me a toaster
My partner ride with his chopper, this nigga think he a soldier
Why I'ma stand in the section when I can stand on the sofa?
So y'all guess what I does, you never say I ain't told ya"
41,Keep It Gangsta,2006,The Inspiration (2006),,Young Jeezy,"Cheaaa, ayeee

Careful what I say 'cause I know dem folks listening, (Damn!)
It's ya boy Mr. 17-5,
Lil mama whole the strap and the work while I drive, (Chea)
Take it out the wrap and I put it on the scale,
But keep that on da low 'cause I ain't trying to go to jail. (Ha Ha)
(Verse: (Slick Pulla))
They call me Slick Manning cause my vision's great, (Chea)
Toss shells like pigskins when I squeeze the 8,
Think I start for the Braves way I rep the A,
Like John Smokes in his prime when I pitch the K,
Got the scale in my pocket on some suicide doors,
Yams in the strap facing suicide time, Let's go
Outlandish wit it man it's stupid how we shine, Aye
Catch me in them bunkers with the troops all the time, (Okay)
I heed like Sadam but I'm sick like Ooday, (OODAY!)
Keeps some youngsters with me and they all bout gunplay, (Ha Ha)
We been had the streets jammed up to stock,
We down south niggas but the plugs up top. (FOR REAL)
(Verse: (Blood Raw))
Blood raw I keep it gangsta my nigga
This for gangstas I ain't talking 'bout you bustas,
Choppa toaters money gettas naw not you suckas,
Coola than a fan coola than a freezer,
Still in da hood ridin' sixes on the Reagal,
Still on MLK still got a side,
Still getting money and I'm still in the trap,
Lil mama say she like me plus she know I'm hood,
I'm a fool wit laying pipe plus she know I'm good,
I got a spot for the yay Uncle Pete keep the K's,
Auntie Shirley got the money if they rush then we straight,
732 shawdy leave it in my pager,
We ain't talking on dem phones 'cause I know you talking paper."

(Verse 1 - Young Jeezy)
Welcome to the life of a young thug nigga (yeah)
Only hang out wit' them criminals and drug dealers (ay)
I'm from even where dead die (die)
But try an' do it big like the kid from Bedstuy
I see death around the corna and I ain't scared
I got a carbon 15 and I'm fully prepared (that's right)
Lord a mercy 20 rounds in a clip (yeah)
Outta line get 20 rounds in ya hip (ay)
Shoot first and ask questions lata' (lata)
The answer is it was all about the paper (yeah)
Everything to gain is shit to lose
And a new forty-five that I'm dyin' to use (yeah)
(Chorus - Ill Will)
If ya real like me (like me)
Throw ya hoods in the air so the whole wide world can see (ay)
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
And if ya real like me (like me)
Keep that thang on ya hip that's just the way that it's gotta be
Last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed, last of a dying breed
(Verse 2 - Young Buck)
I done seen niggaz come and go
Shit the whole world done seen what I done before
We do anythang when the funds is low
I'm the reason outta towners don't come no mo'
Let me show you niggaz how to break down the whole thang
My nigga B.G. know Buck been a birdman
It's got to be in ya blood to be a thug
If I ain't makin' enough I'ma jack my plug
We was born in it
Not sworn in it
You can go against it or you can join wit' it
Made my mark so the streets gon' remember me
Now come and get it nigga Cashville Tennekee holla back
(Verse 3 - Trick Daddy)
Some of the dudes we thought was real O.G.'s was O.B's
'Cause they talked pleas and included G's like you and me
The first step was going to set a trap
So in a short period, they convinced the grand jury to allow a phone tap
And if they listenin'
Not once did they hear us mentioning
Murder and a cocaine distributing
Through all that was dividends comin' in
I'm strict legit, and better yet we too smart for ya bullshit
Callin all cars (callin all cars)
Hit your burglar alarm
And tell 'em hurry up and come them niggaz got gunz
Man down, shots fired, only fuck niggaz and cops died
First stage of a riot
And them fucks couldn't sneak by
Oh you want to witness some shit
Fine bitch, be quiet
Because they only got what you tell 'em
And only witness that they had, the bitch was layin' there dead
Shot in the street all red, with two shots to his head
'Cause he was workin for the feds
And the last informant, informed us
They had it out for us
For a bird that he got popped for
So ride or die for him (ride or die for him)
Better yet, you better kill 'em
'Cause I think he's gonna be the bitch to tell 'em
And he probably done all ready told 'em
But then again without a witness them bitches ain't got shit"

Yeah
She said you ain't no good but you feel so good
She said would if I could but I gotta leave you alone
I gotta leave you alone
She said I know you bad, but I want you bad
She said makes me so sad that I gotta leave you alone
I got my mind on my money
All I need's a bad bitch
That I can run through the city spend this cash with
That I can run through this city spend this cash on
Wake up in the morning get my smash on
I want more much baby egg whites
Keep your stomach in your thighs and your legs right
While I'm out here focus getting this bread right
But if the head right, Jeezy there every night
Wake up in the morning and I'm still here
Wake up in the morning and I ain't gone
All I ask, let me just do me
And maybe just me and you can get along
Had them other bitches mad when they seen us
Had to match our Rolex's baby team us
Yeah the earth is our turf we can share the world
Maybe even go half on a baby girl

She said you ain't no good but you feel so good

Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind
And when I'm done with the front, hit it from behind
Love a loyalty never cross the line
Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind
Show you how to get you on you won't be watching mine
Put you up on G show you how to shine
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time
Be my backbone every nigga need a spine
Gotta know you ride with me if I'm right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and it's all gone
Best believe I'ma get it right back
That's the hustler in me I know you like that
You probably think I'm with a different broad every night
When I think about it shit man you're probably right
The more I think about it shit you're probably wrong
'Cause what you didn't think about is that I'm probably grown

She said she wish she never met me
'Cause she just can't help but let me go ahead
And do whatever the hell I want
She said she hate how much she need me
Turn around, and say she don't need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me
But she don't
But maybe this time I'll be different
'Cause she shed so many tears
She'll remind me all the dumb shit that I've done over the years
But she don't be tripping in the morning, I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done, I swear this is all I hear, yeah
(Hook: Ne-Yo)
She said you ain't no good but you feel so good

1 in the chamber when we aming at you (Blaou)
The young Bob Barker, the price is right
If you C.O.D. then you could get them tonight
Put the fish scale on the scale
If Roy went postal, all he do is check mail (HA HA)
Low key, under the radar
Tripple black 'Vet, yeah I call it the stealth

Almost done, another quarter million in ones

Even in the drought, the boy kept that yay
100 percent served, Snowman's word
You can play my thug and my clientele (why)
I'm addicted to that new car smell
White cookies in a plastic bag
New shoes on the coupe with the paper tag
Whole life flash right before your eyes
See the state troopers and get butterflies
Got a thing for them Heckler and Koches
A minute 14 and Rolex watches
Somewhere in the back of my secret deranged brain
I get a rush when I tote that 'cane
Get money, Nigga fuck them haters
All we fear is the discovery and Inditement papers (wussup)

Put The Mask on, Jim Carey a nigga (Blaou)
Swede ends in the Chevy, got me feelin' akward
Careful with the sweets, don't burn my seats
You could live your whole life and not come close
Guess that's why these rap niggaz take notes
Rectite my adlibs, borrow my quotes
Make me Ihop a nigga, serve them with the toast
Next, they be dressing like me

If I still had the work I getcha sack
It's all gravy still reaching wit my words
And make 'em feel good on the first and the third
Take you back when I was sixteen wit a bankroll
Posted on a corner like a light pole
They used to call us trap stars
Before they even stopped we ran to dem cars
And everybody on the block got the same agenda
Hustle from the beginning of January till the end of December
Wasn't smokin' purple then it was more like bobby brown
On that hen dog got a nigga straight drinkin' brown (7/11 nigga you know)
You know 10 to 4 shake 'em up talk shit get my drink and let 'em go
Even when I'm on the road the gangstas stay in touch
Why the fuck you think they love me so much? (ha ha!)
I'm talking bout summertime cookouts and wintertime flights
It ain't nothing we hearing shots all night (bow)
Ford Taurus pulls up everybody run
White boys jump out pointing wit they guns
Ford Taurus leave everybody came back (hey)
Hope dem boyz didn't find my sack
Real recognize real I suppose
I guess that's why the gangstas be at all my shows
Got the deal nothing changed but my clothes
Still catch me in the jects fuckin' wit dem hoes (projects!)

Lord I wish mad Lou could see me now
Wish gold mouth was there wish mailman was free
A lot of niggaz crossing over dog no not me
Plus I been in the commercials when I watch TV

Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I don't know what you fishin for but catch you a great white
Me, I see great white, heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this, who knew it came in bails
Who knew what came with jail, who knew what came with prison
Just cause you got opinions, does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a seminal?
I say and I quote, ""We need a miracle""
And I say a miracle cause this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces, I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and CC Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor, guess that make me a Konvict
Be all you be, now don't that sound like some dumb shit
When you die over crude oil as black as my nigga Boo
It's really a Desert Storm, that's word to my nigga Clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, A.R. Arizona
Rep for them real niggas, I'm winnin' in California
Winnin' in Tennessee, hands down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama, on my way to Sevana
(Verse 2: Young Jeezy)
I said I woke up this morning, headache this big
Pay all these damn bills, feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes, buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to Polos
Love me some spinach dip, I'm addicted to Houston's
And if the numbers is right I take a trip out to Houston
An earthquake out in China, a hurricane in New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour, I showed my ass in New Orleans
Did it for Soulja Slim, brought out B.G.
It's all love Bun, I'm forgivin you Pimp C
You know how the Pimp be, that nigga gon' speak his mind
If he could speak down from heaven he'd tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin' fine, Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change so y'all let the man shine
Stuntin on Martin Luther, feelin' just like a king
Guess this is what he meant when he said that he had a dream
(Verse 3: Nas)
Yeah, our history, black history, no president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets, had to flip some keys so a nigga won't go broke
Then they put us in jail, now a nigga can't go vote
So I spend doe, all these hoes is trippin'
She a ain't a politician, honey's a polotician
My president is black, rolls golden charms
Twenty-two inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse ya ego, we got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been surprise horses in this stable
Just two albums in, I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr. Black President, yo Obama for real
They gotta put your face on the five-thousand dollar bill
(Outro: Young Jeezy)
So I'm sittin' right here now man
It's June 3rd haha, 2:08 AM
Nigga I won't say win, lose or draw
Man we congratulate you already homie
See I motivate the thugs right
You motivate us homie, that's what it is
This a hands on policy, y'all touchin me right nigga
Yeah, first black president, win, lose or draw nigga
Haha, matter of fact, you know what it is man
Shouts out to Jackie Robinson, Booker T, Washington homie
Oh you ain't think I knew that shit?
Sydney portea what dey do?
Haha, my president is black
I'm important too though, my Lambo's blue
I was, I was the first nigga to ride through my hood in a Lamborghini yeah haha"
50,Never Be The Same,2011,Thug Motivation 103: Hustlerz Ambition (2011),,Young Jeezy,"And I ain't looking to the same, no more my nigga
You will never be the same no, more my nigga
I don't wanna play the game, no more my nigga
You will never be the same, no more my nigga
Now look you're the same, no more my nigga
You will never be the same, no more my nigga
I don't wanna play the game, no more my nigga
You will never be the same, no more my nigga
And I say this is for the hustlaz and every nigga like that
Married to the game, I'm here to tell you though, wife dead
You can go to jail or go home, it's your choice
Every nigga from the ghetto dream is the wrong choice
Countin' dough on the top floor, bad bitch cooking
Head it from the back another bad bitch looking
Champagne dreams, Cadi, yeah I wishin'
Almost done with the game beggin' up
What's the distance and all the niggas seen is things
And broken dreams, broke niggas styles
And there's triple Benz
If we're dancing with the devil at least
Teach us how to dance when the son of making dollars
Is like we never had a chance
You niggas think you know, you have no fucking idea
Look at how I made it here, I have no fucking idea
See I started with a down rock flippin' through a down spot
Heat it so hard then a nigga need a time clock
Nigga over time, over grind, yeah you know
You know me I'm tryna overshine
Yeah that's brighter than the stars and the sky
And even brighter than them flakes in the pie
Luxury cars I lust them we can discuss them
Talking that convertible hard top shit and discussing
Pack a dubs for my niggas behind the wall's sick gang
Got my dogs locked behind the wall's sick gang
I say now what they hittin' for
Cause you know they sky high
Niggas do, bitches do what them numbers don't lie
And forever do these words, real niggas do die
Even thing even birds a real nigga gonna try
The penitentiary ain't never scared me
Either I'm goin' or I ain't, that's just how it's gonna be
They want top dollar and the shit getting stepped on
Got 'em niggas feeling like he being slept on
Sleep is for the weak when the work ain't cheap
Nah, so what's sweet but you can't be weak
They say what don't kill us only makes us stronger
Until they build a better case so they can lock us up longer"
51,No Tears,2014,Seen It All: The Autobiography (2014),,Young Jeezy,"You know I come through on some boss shit every time I come through
I'm from the place where don't nobody make it, but you know they want to
You wanna see a nigga fucked in the game, nigga, don't you?
But I refuse to cry, shed a tear, that's the shit we don't do
Still this is what it sounds like when you open your soul
Tell the realest story that was ever told
Riding dirty in the West End, yes, so ambitious
Them chicken plates at Chanterelles was delicious
Po-po closing that BP, the block storage
If I can get them things back down South I'll make a fortune
Fucked around and caught dawg with a nine, now it's a wrap
Gotta find a new game to conquer, I'm thinking rap
And there's a whole new game, new players, I gotta grind
Put them diamonds in my name and my chain, I gotta shine
Stunting everything'll real when we do break bread with 'em
Swear it ain't been the same since the day the FEDs hit 'em
And that's when I traded the scale for the microphone
Fade a few cars, got rid of my last four songs
And just like that, welcome back, my nigga home
Don't look me in the eye, something different, what could be wrong?
I can never let a tear fall down my face
(I can never let a tear fall down my face)
For the niggas like you who ain't with me today
(For the niggas like you who ain't with me today)
I've been real from the beginning
I can never let a tear fall down my face
(I can never let a tear fall down my face)
I'm losing all my friends like every single day
(I'm losing all my friends like every single day)
I think I've been too, too real from the beginning
(I think I've been too, too real from the beginning)
They say you lose all your friends when you finally start winning
Hey, where the love at?
I guess this is what it feels like when you're royalty, holmes
And you wake up and the loyalty's gone
Them short sentence niggas come on yeah, feel in the way
Same niggas that were hating back then, still in the way
I swear these niggas think my life is just bitches and Champagne
Iced out, Audemar, just to go with the campaign
Every night Rolls Royce's doing their damn thing
If there was ever a reason to wear all them damn chains
And why you keep a cup in your hand? To numb the pain
Niggas see you on something different, these niggas changed
And I ain't one for dry snitching, won't call no name
So really at the end of the day I can't complain
Five niggas gon' be happy with you and be happy for you
If them niggas scheming on ya demise then they ain't for ya
I'm like not you too, my nigga, I could've died
If I had a weak bone in my body I would've cried
I remember them days where I thought I couldn't live without you
(Aye, where the love at?)
Now I'm driving in a coupe and I can't even think about you
(Aye, where the love at?)
We was counting millions on the living room floor
I forgot, niggas like you don't love back
And I was with you when we kicked in our own first door"
52,Nothin',2011,Thug Motivation 103: Hustlerz Ambition (2011),,Young Jeezy,"Man them young niggas killing 'bout nothing
Show up at the spot with the choppers like nothing
Full fifty shots, clear the block like nothing
If you made it from the bottom to the top like nothing
You don't owe a nigga nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing...
You don't owe a nigga nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing...
You don't owe a nigga
Put your cups in the air, I'd like to make a toast
In case it goes down, yeah you know I got my toast
And when you really from the streets that's when they hate you most
And when you really got it then that's when they hate you close
Knew him back in the day when we was gettin' money
Now every time I see the nigga he be actin' funny
Don't you niggas see it? I'm a little pressed for time
Wanna talk about the past, told 'em press rewind
And I ain't feelin' what you sayin' ho, you out of place
I have you feeling what I'm sprayin' yeah it's on my waist
I'm trying to chill, smoke a couple with my lady friends
So they can meet me at the telly in the latest Benz
Nigga you see me getting mine, you better get yours
Are you the one doing the serving or you gettin' served?
Or you the one doing the jackin', or you gettin' jacked
Or you the one that's goin' hard or you fallin' back
And I don't believe in falling back, bitch I'm goin' hard
They wanna see me fucked up, man I swear to God
They praying that I fail, I'm praying that I rise
I guess the hating didn't work so now they tellin' lies
Oh he ain't did this, and he ain't did that
Boy keep it real wit' ya self, you know he lived that
You ain't real, you don't give 'em what they asking for
Such a real nigga, what the fuck you askin' fo'
And you don't even know a nigga, what you hating for?
And I ain't going nowhere so what you waiting for?
Beat the street, this rap shit cake and ice cream
Fuck the selling words, bitch I sold ice cream
From the bottom to the top, that's a nice dream
How you make it out young? I had a nice scheme
And I don't owe a nigga shit, better get it right
Just know a nigga stayed down each and every night
Hands on, yeah I broke down my own things
Hands on, yeah I counted up my own chains
Fifties over here, twenties over there
You know the rest, nigga, fives and singles everywhere"

OJ, yeah probably don't get it
I'm the best that ever did it and got away with it
(Jadakiss - Verse 3)
Italian money and everything with 'em
Gloves don't fit 'em so they gotta acquit him
Ain't nobody seen it, but everybody heard it
The whole town hatin', they waitin' on a verdict
Tell 'em niggas pop off, I'm waitin on a drop off
I ain't leaving the block till I knock the box off
Yeah taking care of the whole fam
Bought the Porsche gave the M to my old man
More money more problems
More grams, more real estate, more land
At fight night I be ringside

Put my Yankee hat on"
56,Seen It All,2014,Seen It All: The Autobiography (2014),,Young Jeezy,"I said you already know nigga, you ain't gotta flow
Before rap, young really got dough
Before rap, young really seen snow
In the kitchen 'bout to make some magic
Then blow it all in magic, Pull up to my partner in traffic
Gave it to him, it was all in plastic
All I know, I ain't tryna go to jail
Heard that shit closest thing to hell
When it's stepped on make it hard to sell
When you been where I been, make it hard to fail
'Cause I'm the realest nigga in this
Y'all know it first nigga hitting magic in that 6-45
Valet say ""Jizzle nigga, stay in new shit""
But everybody bach back 'cause that nigga can't drive
Doors open up I emerge with ten chains
Even back then they was calling me ten chains
Ask me what I spent, I tell 'em it's no thing
Even if I had to add it up, it'da cost like ten things
We used to take a little show money just to throw money
If it's on the floor nigga, it's the floor money
If you bought it out the blow, when you got it from the blow
Then that's why the fuck they call that shit blow money
Still the realest nigga in this, y'all know it
Kept it one hundred till the day I came through
My nigga hit me up saying ""going out of town""
So I threw him fifty thou, told him ""bring me back two""
Not only had my fingers crossed, I prayed
Caught his little piece up, got laid
Then he walked in, threw them both on the table said
""Fuck that shit, young nigga get paid""
Then I whipped the Benzo on Lorenzo
Stay down nigga you don't talk like ten toes
Hoes see me in this big pretty mothafucka
Bet I leave the parking lot with about ten hoes
I done seen it all
Yay stack seven feet tall
Swear it look white like a wall
What you know about thumbing through the hundreds, twenties, and the fifties
Spending tens and the fives at the mall?
I done seen it all
20/20 Pyrex vision
Catch a contact standing next to my kitchen
Hear the 20s, 50s, hundreds, the money machine clickin'
And my Rollie ain't tickin', I ball
I done seen it all
Uncle died on the spot
Pop killed the family with heroin shots
Gave my life to the block
Figured, I get shot 'least I die on top
I came alive in the drop
Big body all white shit looked like a yacht
I got 'em five grand a pop
I had a plug in Saint Thomas on a trillion watts
Flew him back to the States, park 92 bricks in front of 560 State
Now the Nets a stone throw from where I used to throw bricks
So it's only right I'm still tossing 'round Knicks
Probably brought your auntie a couple bags
I probably front your uncle a couple halves
I was in the S-Class you was just in class
You know I was finna blow like a meth lab
Expanded the operation out in Maryland
Me and Emory Jones in the caravan
Took the show on the road out in VA
Dropped a couple off with Rolla in the PA (Real Rolla!)
Plug got shot started slowing up
Took a trip down to see how he was holding up
The wars on now he got shot again
This time he was gone for good then we got it in
Emory got knocked we was down 10
The whole team hot wars closing in
Niggas can't tell me shit about this dope game
'Bout this cocaine, man I done seen it all
I done seen it all
Yay stack seven feet tall
Swear it look white like a wall
What you know about thumbing through the hundreds, twenties, and the fifties
Spending tens and the fives at the mall?
I done seen it all"

Every time you see me on grind: stay on that working shit
All I ever want's a bad bitch in a Chanel bag
Sweet niggas want her 'cause they know she got Chanel swag
Straight like that, yeah I fuck with her the long way
Been bragging to my partners: I been talking about her all day
Pull up in that Super-coupe: you know them diamonds glistening
Too much money in the room, guess I hit her in the kitchen then
Get her to myself man, I ain't hit that girl yet
Now that I got her to myself man, you know I'm tryna get that girl wet
Keep it one thousand with you: I really think I'm diggin' her
Can't hear nothing but the money so she might just think I'm big enough
(Verse 2: 2 Chainz)
Rick James, super freak
She got that wet-wet: now that's a superleak

OK I'm done with that, you can run with that, I'ma switch it up
This bitch I'm with is thick as fuck, I'm rich as fuck

She with me if I'm wrong or I'm right, yeah she my type
Baby girl go and get the bread, she know what I like
Meet her at my low-key apartment, never at the house
Every time we got pulled over, never ran her mouth
Fuck with real niggas, get money baby, on the chain
Long as baby stay getting money, how can I complain?
Favorite girl, guess she got the skills just to pay the bills
Last nigga she was fuckin' with was worth a couple mil
Even when she going for the low, says she's not a ho
Yeah you know that thing is super-wet: call it sloppy joe
Said she like it when I whip it fast then I whip it slow
Even though she got a lot of names, I just call her ""blow"""

66,The Inspiration (Follow Me),2006,The Inspiration (2006),,Young Jeezy,"What's up?
Ha ha
Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute?
I was in the streets the other day,
I had a homie come through and he ask me
Say ""Yo! Everybody listen to you,
Everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?""
I told him ""Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty""
Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go
I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy
From the city where them young niggas die skinny
Keep work on deck if you need any
Just holler at them boys 'cause they keep plenty, follow me!
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders
And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready
Feels like I was born for this
If not, at least I'll die for it
They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it
The big question is what can I do for the youth?
Everybody lyin' to 'em so I told 'em the truth
""I'm a hustler!"" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I got hustle!"" One man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I'm a hustler!""
Real niggas don't die, they go to the Feds
Fresh out, right back chasin' bread
My life's so hard, so concrete
I was raised by 'em homie, that's why I think so street
Take me for instance
My life is not about you, think me for instance
I did the impossible, I made it out
Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out
I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast
Now I'm thinking holmes, got my right blinker on
Spread my word, got my Kirk Franklin on
Stuntin' in traffic like ""This my car""
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far
Life's a bitch so I'm tryna wife her
Just ball around, you know, buy her some things
Lovin' every minute of it, still breakin' chains
Y'all my brush, let me paint a perfect picture
Gotta pay attention 'cause it's three dimensional
Same picture, see it one of three ways
Let it marinate, it might take a few days
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence
So I shouldn't say nothin' Get a moment of silence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Words to live by, took it out of context
They say your pass is your present and your present is your cash
So I look forward to the future
Get a lil' paper your baby momma won't have
Part of the college so I need a forecast
Where's the weatherman at when you need him?
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him
And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin' tell him"

From givin' the mic up and goin' back to the streetz (naww)
What's the difference, I still eat the same
A nigga paranoid, I still sleep the same
You niggaz rappin' 'bout blow, like it's a fad
Nigga this is my life, I ain't tryna set trends
'Cause everybody knows how that brick-road ends
Heartless, maybe I need to see the Wizard
Until then, Imma make it snow blizzards
(Verse 3: Young Jeezy)
I stay on the block, and risk my life
Day in and day out until a nigga sold out
You niggaz playin', I show you what that street shit 'bout
Hit you right up with them thangs, and come back with the chains
Might cook it in the stove, might cook it in the microwave
Either way it's gonna sell, still weigh it on the scale
You rappin'-ass niggaz ain't never sold no yams
I'm talkin' sucka-free Sundays and iced-out Mondays
Pin-up Tuesdays and body-tap Wednesdays
You was in the studio, I was on the block
In the kitchen at the spot goin' hard with the blocks

No, you be feeling my words when I be talking that street smart
Yeah, school of Hard Knocks, yeah bitch I graduated
Straight to them hard blocks and nothing was barricaded
You know the world is waiting, waiting, waiting on 103
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting, they waiting...
We need some motivation, -vation
So won't you come motivate me?
They waiting, they waiting, they waiting, they waiting..."
77,Way Too Gone,2011,Thug Motivation 103: Hustlerz Ambition (2011),,Young Jeezy,"I'm way to gone, what the fuck I'm a doing
Wake up in the morning, who the fuck am I screwing?
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white
You know it's going down, I can do this all night
Gotta get to the paper one time for the haters
Money over bitches two times for the fakers
Cause even in the dark, baby I'm a shine bright
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life
Yeah, I said g-g-g-go DJ
I see you got that Jizzle on replay
Just keep that Jizzle on repeat
It's about the time everybody scream ""free Meech!""
Let's take ya bitch ass back to '05
Close your eyes, take a rough nigga look, Atlanta lights
Club vision, PJ in my hand, I'm on the couch
Man this nigga Meech just blew a quarter mil, he bought a house
Man you niggas gonna lace up your sneaks, it's time to ball
Presidential at the Swiss Hotel, making come alls.
Posted up, all black in the back, 100 deep
A hundred coupes posted up in the front, 200 seats
Man somebody call the IRS, too many lambos
Yeah I'm talking bottles and blunts, all you can handle
Them other niggas fake, to them fallings where it's at.
Man the real niggas do real things, let's drink to that!
I'm way to gone, what the fuck I'm a doing
Wake up in the morning, who the fuck am I screwing?
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white
You know it's going down, I can do this all night
Gotta get to the paper one time for the haters
Money over bitches two times for the fakers
Cause even in the dark, baby I'm a shine bright
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life
I said I'm gone! I'm going going gone!
Way this night is going, man I won't make it home
I'm a wake up in the room, wake up with a hangover
What I spent last night I could bought a Range Rover
Got my Raybans on, yeah I see you haters
Keep doing what you doing, 'cause I need you haters
She said what's your cologne, said you can call it strong
If I had to name my money baby, I would call it long.
I said I'm way too gone, I don't see nobody,
I ain't even on the bill, I'm acting like it's my party.
Feel like I'm on fire or just that hot,
If I smoke another blunt, yeah I swear I'm gonna die
You can call the weed man, tell him bring another zip
I know he just left, yeah he gotta make another trip
So hot in here feel like I'm going to faint
Even though I'm past my limit, still think I'm gonna drink
(Future)
I woke up early this morning,
Three white girls from the Pink Pony,
I'm blowing money fast, so caught up in the moment
One time for the bar, two times for my homies,
I'm a rock star in real life; I'm an astronaut outta sight.
Put Codeine in my Sprite, my wrist is full of ice
I don't even know her name, she so caught in the hype.
Its ok baby, 'cause I'm a millionaire for life,
I got bitches on my payroll, they coming back like white
I'm with Ethiopian, we in Vegas shootin' dice
Got a girl at home, I know I'm wrong, it feels so right
On the first road, young I hope I wrote a sinch
We in the club for thugs, this must be heaven."

Same time poppin' Cristal, posing for pictures
Ol' smart ass nigga, half right and half wrong
Only problem is he still here and the money gone
Oh me, oh my, give me a natural high
When I think about the nights we threw them Rollies in the sky
When I was so mother fuckin' clean on 'em, need a tie
Every hater in the club was just wishin' we would die
A hustlers life is filled with decisions he gotta make
Remeber when I got the news I was ready to cry late
Swear my levy was 'bout to break, lost religion and all my faith
I swear I seen the same shit happen to (?)
Can you imagine that look I had on my face?
Saw my nigga layin' still in a box with a waste
Got me feelin' sick, like I'm 'bout to vomit
I guess a loss ain't shit if you ain't learn somethin' from it

Then I visualize
And I strategize
One false move will get your ass penalized
Nigga you can't be serious
What if pac was hearin this
""You bullshittin me? ""
I'm sure biggie would agree
If he had to pass the torch, then that bitch'll go to me
Now wouldn't you agree? does it matter? I accept?
Have you ever see a blue rolls go on the black grass?

Entrepreneur he found him a new crack

'Cause when he get rich they gon hate that nigga
They gon try they best to try 'n' break that nigga"
