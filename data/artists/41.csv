0,(Goin' All Out) Nothin' To Lose,1998,IV (1998),,Cypress Hill,"(B Real)
I got nothin' to lose I'm goin' all out
The deuce never stop I refuse to play by the rules
Uptight when you steppin into the night right
Pigs comin' up and shinin the bright light
Nothin' better to do than fuck with the pride
When you hide behind your badge your gun and ride
Billy club show me no love think you above
All the fuss and the locs is rushin in too close
Let me lay it on the table, forget stable
Freak niggaz, comin' to slay to the label
You got nothin' to lose, come on choose
Stay away from niggaz that bring down your crew
Whatever it takes, you make or break yourself
With the wealth or the chance to stay in good health
Sword blade swingin' you back off away
And the track off the real, straight off the Hill
What the deal motherfucker?
(Chorus: B-Real, Sen Dog)
I got nothin' to lose (I'm goin' all out)
Nothin' to lose (You gonna fall out) Time run out
(I'm goin' all out) Nothin' to lose (I'm goin' all out)
Lightin the fuse to the bomb (better run out)
Nothin' to lose (I'm goin' all out)
Nothin' to lose (You gonna fall out) Time run out
(I'm goin' all out) Nothin' to lose (I'm goin' all out)
Lightin the fuse to the bomb (better run out)
(Sen Dog)
I'm goin' all out, showin y'all what I'm about
Gettin' in your mental, knockin' niggaz out
Takin' this pencil, across the brain
Ain't stoppin' there till the rhymes all drained
All out my system, take em, and then I twist em
Put 'em out one day and see, who wanna diss em
As you fold I'll sting ya, run up and you bitch up
Y'all get the picture, just call Mr. Excitement
Comin' with the thunder and lightning
Shit is quite frightening how niggaz keep biting
So I keep the writing, down for the fighting
Cold with the flows, they both quite exciting
And let me take space up, heat your face up
I'm goin' all out, before the raise up
Come on, come on
(B-Real)
I'm goin' all out, nothin' to lose, you better roll out
Sold out, niggaz be livin' in times run out
In the present smell the prescence of what you stressin
You get sent a lesson ain't missin' the point blessin
Expression, feelin' the tension over the session
The question, fillin your body with intention
Don't mention the profession, keep adressin
The real motherfuckers in the crowd pay attention
I'm goin' the fuck out, Smith and Wesson
You better stall me out, no extension
Only the strong will ever be settin the pace
When you look up I'm gone and never left a trace
No worries, set you with flurries and no juries
Eight million stories in the city of furies
Don't get the twist, you listen or get the fist
I got nothin' to lose so I gat fools with this
(Sen Dog)
Oh yeah, Cypress Hill massive once again
Comin' to your record shop
Check this out, we ain't takin' no prisoners
We choppin heads off
And you steppin at me, you better be goin' all out baby
This is war baby, from now until the new m-m-mm-mm-millelnium"
1,(Rap) Superstar,2000,Skull & Bones (2000),,Cypress Hill,"Eminem Speaking
Most people don't see how much work is really involved
In this rap shit
I didn't know it
I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what it's like
But you always gotta
People always gotta see your smile
You always gotta put on that fake
You know what I'm sayin'
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
B-Real
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large into a big house
5 cars, you're in charge
Comin' up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
B-Real
I remember the days when I was a young kid growin' up
Lookin' in the mirror dreamin' about blowin' up
To rock crowds make money
Chill with the homies
Signing autographs and whatever the people wanted from me
Shits funny
How impossible dreams manifest in the games that be comin' with it
Nevertheless you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin some of your peers
And losin some of yourself
Music has past gone by
Hopefully you won't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shits deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill
But never will
Till he crosses over still
Fillin your head
With fantasies come with me
I'll show you the sacrifice it takes to make the G's
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay the way
Trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing
No fans
No fame
No respect
No change
No women
And everybody shits on your name
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
Into big house
5 cars
The rent charged
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
And be a rap superstar
And live large
Into a big house
5 cars
You're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
Noreaga Speaking
When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these whiteboys don't care about you
'Cause the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-n-Noreaga
And they'll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while your hot
And madafuckin get out the game
This isn't like the drug game this is even worse
Because in the drug game if someone jerks you
You can shoot 'em and kill em
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be noble
Eminem Speaking
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything gotta be all good
When you see someone slap hands with em
You know what I'm sayin' give 'em a pound
Or whatever it is
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit
(B-Real)
My own son don't know me
I'm chillin' in a hotel room lonely
But I thank god I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
Are gonna show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road solely
So the record gets pushed by sony
I'm in the middle like monie
And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them homies at the paladium
Who just wanna cling on swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin' ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They are the fuckin' evil"
2,(Rap) Superstar (Alchemist Remix),2002,Stash (2002),,Cypress Hill,"No matter what you just been through, this gotta be right. You gotta approach people, you gotta be on the up and up, everything's gotta be all good. When you see somebody, slap hands wit 'em, you know what I'm sayin'?

5,16 Men Till There's No Men Left,1998,IV (1998),,Cypress Hill,"16 men on a dead man's list yo ho ho, and a bag of indo.
16 men on a dead man's list yo ho ho, and a bag of indo.
So many fuckin' MC's claim supremacy,
On who's got hip hop locked it could never be,
One crew or solo runnin' the whole game
That's bullshit. Like cops never sniff cocaine.
But I'm takin' on all comers, droppin' bombers
Reducing numbers, makin' it hot like the summer.
This one MC couldn't deal with the skill
Like Jack did Jill I rolled his ass down the Hill.
Beaten, broken, and coughin, and chokin on the rhyme,
Like a hooker suckin a dick for the first time.
His rhyme was hallow with no flow to follow
Bust the nut all in his mouth and made him swallow.
I'll take 16 MC's and lock 'em in a room,
Make 'em feel the contact, eatin the mushrooms.
Playin' with your mind makin' you feel the force,
Had to cancel out 2 punk niggas up in the Source.
They tried to get double XL they still fell,
Bitches go tell your troubles to Montell.
16 men on a dead man's list yo ho ho, and a bag of indo.
16 men on a dead man's list yo ho ho, and a bag of indo.
I'm trippin' on the people controlling the airwaves
Got in goin' on, you know it all but God save,
Youass for clashin, with a Soul Assassin
That's like Mike fuckin' with poppa Joe Jackson.
Ass whoop all over the place,
You can't hide behind the physical
Better run to the spiritual.
Ass whoop critical or you can get it from the lyrical
Dysfunctional, hypocritical smile on your face
Fuckin' cynical shit braines.
As I sit back and say tally ho
One of these days your punk ass gonna go
Wish you had a key to figure the fuckin' flow
But you're locked out and the bombs about to blow.
16 men on a dead man's list yo ho ho, and a bag of indo.
16 men on a dead man's list yo ho ho, and a bag of indo.
12 punk to go who's next on the list
Matter of fact I got one in my head to fix.
There was one particular fool in the circle who fell off
Greed over came a nigga, who at all cost.
Changes up to gain it all but shared none.
Who made him all the money to over come,
Niggas upo on the Hill in the lab,
While he was rollin' big baller style high profile.
Oh child, make wanna act juvenile,
All smiles right in my face, but wait a minue now.
Welcome to the 360, degrees pay a fee
When you're fuckin' your people over the cheese.
No soul, no conscience, no loyalty,
To the niggas who got him treated like royalty.
When your4 times up you're gonna end up seein visions
Of everybody you fucked over, you're scared sober.
16 men on a dead man's list yo ho ho, and a bag of indo.
16 men on a dead man's list yo ho ho, and a bag of indo.
Fuck the hater with the symbol and soul
Nad the bitch niggas who stole my care stereo.
Trick Dees get no love he gets nuts like ass Miller
And the fuckin' x dealer.
Can't forget the niggas who was down with the Hilla,
You get bumped like C Tucker and Will Benette
Let step over the Hump and represent it.
You go down like Jerry and get smacked like Trick Leo
Now here's your fuckin' eulogy o.
There was 16 men now there's no one left
Yo ho ho, and a bag of indo.
There was 16 men now there's no one left
Yo ho ho, and a bag of indo."
6,3 Lil' Putos,1993,Black Sunday (1993),,Cypress Hill,"""Live and direct""
One little two little three little putos
Tried to jack me they got the boot-o
Taking no shit when push comes to shove
'Cause the niggas showed me no love
Step back punk 'cause I'm a Latino
What I bring you is the hardcore lingo
Funky, but ya don't understand
Now I gotta stand with the Glock in my hand
No scope
And there's no hope
'Cause I'm dishin'
Out my .45 slug and it ain't missin'
Here it comes hissin'
Here it comes hummin' at ya
Now the slug is comin' at ya
One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
Cuando entro, loonie es el fuerte
Speakin' to the gente
'Cause I'm insane in the mente
Movin' 'em back, click-click goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
It's no fun
When I got to break you off some
Of the psycobeta beatdown, boy you get done
Serio
Here we go
Off for the muchacho
Come if you really want some of the chingazo
Me caso you don't hear this little lazo
Cypress Hill, breaking you off a pedazo
Humming at ya
Don't make me come gatt ya
Punk 'cause I still will be comin' at ya
One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
When I come in, kickin' with a vengeance
Swift of the engines
Coming like the three little indians
Stompin' around on the ground on the plains
'Cause a nigga like me is goin' insane
In the brain
So I gotta maintain
My direction
What I mighta gained
Without my protection
Not a damn thing
So when I come just bring
That new style, break ya off like a chicken wing
Buckooock!
So you can just suck my cock
Like a fat blunt, stoned is the way of the walk
When I'm peepin'
Checkin' out the punk-ass creepin'
I let the dogs loose then I let the dogs sick 'em
Graaah! Nigga don't make me catch ya
Punk 'cause I still will be comin' at ya
One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground 'cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run"
7,A Man,2000,Skull & Bones (2000),,Cypress Hill,"(Sen Dog)
Don't let nobody treat me like crap
I'm pullin heads off sharp and smack 'em off francs
The best in these days I smoke on these tracks
Gonna mash your plan for holdin' me back
Jump up rush the office with the gat
Lettin the niggaz see where my mind is at
Hurry up to the walls see how I react
But I keep comin' back and that's for a fact
I got the beef, but no road I got dropped
And take each day the bullshit don't stop
Got to act with the man 'cause I don't suck cock
No matter how bad I wanna get to the top
The music go out like a fuckin' lot
With the key and the dat I rap and just stop
Come and see me on a Soul Assas trip
Hittin stage, generate, pumpin all that lip
You can't fuck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fuckin' man!
You can't fuck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fuckin' man!
(Sen Dog)
If y'all ever need help I don't wait
And I come from some shit that's put away
I hit these suckers that think they so great
Still a nigga die, so they can update
No matter how you try you'll always be fate
Breakin off chunks off of what I create
I see that liquorice all over your face
Back-stab a nigga in the mist of the chase
Fuck the bullshit let's get to the bottom
Stompin punk styles, agein rock got em
Only thing I don't wanna say when I drop em
Loadin my shells so don't try to hock em
Hittin the heat with the jig-ass beats
Bite my style, is the only way to compete
Smoke anybody if I ever lop heat
And anybody else that wanna fuck with me
You can't fuck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fuckin' man!
You can't fuck with me
I am everything you ever want to be
A fuckin' man!
(Sen Dog)
I sing funky-ass shit that I bring
Fly likes a lot when I do my thing
Check it out y'all ain't no one nicer
Got it goin' on with the mighty wanna cipher
Got a women crazy, when I beg
And hip-hop styles with the SX-10
Trust no one ain't nobody your friend
Cause this business hear all about to end
Don't mean comin' back when they bust the raps
And all the little things of the nicer tracks
Hangin' out in the uniform
Keep what I'm doin' here all night long
Is to keep it goin', bring the thunder and pain
Ain't bitches same since I went insane
Fuckin' with these bitches up in this game
To the depicts, drain on my FUCKIN' TRAIN
You can't fuck with me
I am everything you ever want to be

You can't fuck with me

Fools think they get bad, I ain't really with that
Flavour of the month, bro, (?) try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down, an' stripped butt-naked

You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say ""fuck the rest""
'Cause we take away ya stress and never settle for less

When you deal with the Hill, keep your mouth still
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
If you have no ideal, or any thoughts to feel
What you sought was real, to give 'em slots to fill
Busters stop to deal
But I face them, quicker than takin' a box of pills
Now you gots to chill
Get cops and sheilds, steady, hark the (?)
If they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill
As I lock the wheel, don't you mock the drill
'Cause I'll cock my steel, make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you talk to deal
Quit talk and kneel, you won't top my will, bitch!

12,Another Body Drops,2004,Till Death Do Us Part (2004),,Cypress Hill,"(Verse One)
My first mission
Running through the hood with small jacks
My memories popping in my head recall that
Late night creeping through the alley with six dudes
Scraped up everybody focused no mixed views
The sawed off pump in my hand with two shells
The other four homies on the scene with cocktails
One nigga looking for po po
Someone looking through windows
The doorbells go followed by the pump and gas bomb
Adrenaline pumped up
Still I remain calm
House lit up
You can see it for eight blocks
Running through the hood
Running from them fake cops
They gave chase but they couldn't cover the streets up
We broke out ran into the spot to meet up
Strapped down cover up the tracks
And back home
Lay low earn me a strap
Perfect
Shoot Em Up Bang Bang
Another body drop
You can't stop the hip-hop
(Verse Two)
I'll hit your block up
Better lock up
Fuck the gangsta shit, it don't stop a
I'm mad dog with the bomb in the regal
Going to the mall, and kill all your people
Coast to coast, and a lil more evil
The maniac killer
Car so diesel
Ride the block with m16
44 mag
Fit this here hand grenade
I'll break it off right quick
Niggaz be duckin when they see my bucket
Roll down their block they high they say fuck it
Jump back and forth
Like a assassin
30 yards with the inferred action
True pistolire
Black Doc Holiday
Just a true raider of the modern day
Shoot Em Up Bang Bang
Another body drop
You can't stop the hip-hop
(Verse Three)
I ran all missions
When I was a youth so thoughtless
G ride no fingerprints, its spotless
6 4 sitting on easy we got this
Rag top down like a stripper we topless
See me hit the corner you melt down
Slugs fly thugf die moment you fell down
Somebody screaming yo get the hell down
I'm certified nigga, where you sitting is spell bound
Your dogs walking, just hearing the hell hounds
Burn you with the heaters spitting out 12 rounds
Its life in the hood
No escaping the gun play
One day I'm out, gotta figure out some way
Rats in the park
Dark scattering thugs spray
Got you locked in, not one slug was stray
I found ways out, but it seems to be one way
Gotta duck my darts back until Sunday
Shoot Em Up Bang Bang
Another body drop
You can't stop the hip-hop"
13,Another Victory,2000,Skull & Bones (2000),,Cypress Hill,"Get ready motherfuckers!
You can't fuck with the gizzle
Please no interruptions
Your crew pull up guns get waxed in the sun
Like my rag top six-five
Smash you with the switches
The hitch is, you're gettin' too big for your britches
Why you runnin' like bitches
With your tail up, I'm the thug pirate
Put the sail up - your whole crew frail, what
You want this joint, suck it inhale nut
Niggas are feelin' this track in Braile, huh
We're grade A while you motherfuckers fail, what
You understand, immitators gotta bail up
To all the males and females gangin' up
All on my cell phone talkin' shit, hangin' up
I gotta show you how a nigga bang it up
Slangin' cuts
Your squad against mine
You're minor leagues with major
Detail the plans like verse
Hit hard, catch you off guard
Another Victory
I slay rappers with precision
I got vision like Anakin
You panicin' I'm leavin' you stiffer than a mannequin
My high lyrics constantly brain damagin'
Brandishin' a fire arm, still managin'
Hurt niggas, bandagin' who give my lyrics
That play you like the mandolin
I hold my mic like my dick, but you handlin'
I kill flows on tracks who abandonin'
I eat you like pussy, then take a sample,
Then spit fire in the places you standin' in
I take a fool to the Hill
Light a candle then you in the dark stuck part in the scandalin'
Now I see your whole brain's scramblin'
Don't like what you hear, change the channel then nigga
Your squad against mine
You're minor leagues with major
Detail the plans like verse
Hit hard, catch you off guard
Another Victory
I spark cells of a rhythm
You best listen, get it over with
Stolen shit, rollin' it, Cypress ownin' it
Bitin' niggas clonin it,
I got a dog got a bone to pick, you holdin' it
Suck it hard swallow easy, put a soul in it
Your body's on the floor, head got a hole in it
The weed master, rhyme killer, mic controllin' it
You still fuckin' but your wack, ain't throwin' it
Stepped in shit, now your chillin' all alone in it
Head full of hair, still ain't combin' it
Five child in the world who's ropin' it
Never know if I'm high or I'm throwin' shit
I got you stuck in the Twilight Zone on shit
I'm the owner of the fat joint you rollin' with, bitch
Your squad against mine
You're minor leagues with major
Detail the plans like verse
Hit hard, catch you off guard

Didn't have another hand
Never had another plan

It's hotter than a summer jam
Live for today
Cause you'll never gettin another chance

Wild child from the isles
I can go forever like an old fashioned country mouse
Stilo be guajiro

I bang Pina del Rio
Lockin up this function

Show me respect though
Uno memento

Like the cream in your coffee, burning hot
Climbing the billboards for the number one spot
King or the block, stop for a second to watch
Look and learn and loose your top
No more bottles to drop
We still rolling
Pocket's swollen
We're locked and loaded
And the scene exploded
And we're solid as ever on any endeavour
Cypress Hill forever doesn't get any better
We came and saw and conquered it all
We're hungry for more like the kids in Darfur
We live hard still armed and dangerous
We young love be alarmed, don't play with us
Play this song, gotta bounce just to stay with us
Come along hit the bong and blaze with us

Knocked 'em out the park when I'm standing on home plate

So many years of blood sweat and tears
Without me the dogs stay switching the gears
I'm still the same man from back in the day
And I'm still getting luck from Africa to LA
Tape one hit play
Burst started to sway
Every time I leave the city fools want me to say
'Cause they stay loyal so it's harder to go
And like the lights I got's to grow
That means I'll roll but I'll return later
Give props to my and buckshots to haters

Just as you caught in the rapture
All I hear is laugher
In a year's time some of you punks won't matter
Let's see if you can hang if you can climb the ladder
You're not a rapper you're a fucking joke
A one-track hack on a track get your pass revoked
I got keys to the city and we locking you out
Come hard for the paint and I'm blocking you out
So run for the hills and hide in the can
Just put the mic down
And be that fan
With your petty hands outside the lobby
I'm a pro get my signature

We young love be alarmed, don't play with us

Some of us out - he used to think we were invincible
On the corner bangin' and slangin' the high bitual
Deadly rituals fill my head, nothin' spiritual
Bullets filled up bodies like hands from my physical
I got touched by the hot hands of bitter fools
Divided and tempted snake bitten by the ridicule
Frustration and hate filled my adrenaline
I play doctors here's two bullets for your medicine
I carry those days like a weapon close to me
The memories of hot lead rippin' a hole through me
(Chorus: B-Real)
Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Stand...
B-Real
So many, come and go in this lifetime that you serve
Faces change, liscenses' everywhere you turn
Gangsta's become blinded, visions become blurred
Learned to stay alive to the real side of the curb
You came along way but some still refuse to notice
They turned they back on us and they tried to provoke us
You ask about us, you talk trash about us
Walk fast around us, but my block fast allowed us
Don't try to crowd us nigga, we'll smack you up
Look around and see who's willin' to back you up
You're in a ghost town and home alone like Macaulay nigga
Don't say my name nigga, don't even think of me
Fire start spittin' from my grill piece, ya scorched up, touched up
I'm the C4 that blew up your porch
I spit venom quicker than the punch on your Porsche
Venom so deadly I'll make your fuckin' life divorce ya
Ask for Alamoney, bitches, you all phoney
I'll make you sing the blues like you're Paulpau Coloney
Go ask Moley, you in the middle of shit
And anything you say I'll be known the shit
The force drops hits a ball, makin' me die of laughter
'Cause I know what these son-of-a-bitches are after
Your mind and soul, if your blind and cold
Then your true sign is shown, then your fuckin' mind is blown
(Chorus: B-Real)
Son, fill your heater, how bout chase killer
Rock 'em up and show you're no quitter
Snakes' pit every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
You hate the songs that you pump up all day long
Hated on, but we're still standin' strong
Snakes' pit, every ground I landed on
Hated on, but I'm still standin' strong
Stand..."

Pick it, pack it, fire it up, come aloooong
And take hits from the boooong
Put the blunt down just for a second
Don't get me wrong it's not a new method
Inhale, Exhale - just got a ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double barrel bong is gettin' me stoned
I'm skill it, There's water inside don't spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it, goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky funky smelly green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long
As I take Hits from the bong...

Let's smoke that bowl, hit the bong
And then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it, unplug it, don't straaaain
I love you Mary Jane
She never complains, when I hit Mary
With that flame, I light up the cherry
She's so good to me, when I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don't get me stirred up the smoke, through the bub-bling water
Is Makin' it pure so I got ta', take my hit and hold it
Just like Chong, I hit the bowl and I reload it
Get my four-footer and bring it on...

Boom biddy bye bye
Step back as I'm kicking up dust
For a while
As I put mothafuckas to rest
And pull their files
Out from the cabinet
With the picture
Get the 45 and settle it
With this punk nigger
Slow your roll
As I take control
Take your toke from the Indo'
Then hit and hold
Now let it out
How you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls
And you're coughing up a lung anyhow
You can't shake
That nigger that's gonna brake
Fool
On any one member of your bitch crew
As I pull the trigger
On my nine
Say goodnight nigger

The raw dog
Fuck a law dog
Still handin' out beat - downs wit' my sawed - off

Perfect combination, check it
Verse One: Wyclef, B-Real
[Wyclef] You say guns
[B-Real] I say pistolas
[Wyclef] Well if you got beef son
[B-Real] Callate la boca
[Wyclef] Go meet me on the island where the Cubans meet the Haitians
[B-Real] A bullet beats the verbal lyrical assassination
[Wyclef] From L.A. to Brooklyn why you doin' all that talkin'
[B-Real] Think you got a soul but you're a Dead Man Walking
[Wyclef] Yo toast the host from coasts' we boast
When we meet again, I will be Casper that Friendly Ghost
[B-Real] You'll hear shots, like the show Cops
Things are still the same, I'm still growin' crops
[Wyclef] Wyclef with B-Real, let me build better yet
[B-Real] Killa bee kill

Verse Two: B-Real, Wyclef
Fools run up, but they've never seen the last
Spread your last lyrics get broken like glass
Can he pass or does he possess the will
Or does he need to create to keep him straight on the real
Punks are broken some dey fall off the ledge
Refugee Camp bringin' it straight over the edge
You duck as I fluff the feathers from ya skin
How ya gonna win that's like Satan without no sin (without no sin)
They'll never happen while I'm rappin' I be watchin
The Philistines, creepin' up in Manhattan
The sun turn up though Wyclef produce a track with Muggs
But there's no survivors, they all died in the flood
Verse Three: Wyclef, B-Real
Yo, once a child, twice a villain
If this was drugs I'd make a million off this combination
They say you'redope Clef you're dope so they offer me sess and beer
Beware, you pull your wallet Mr. Thief stares
The opposite direction of the room, he pulled his gun and said
I'm doomed join the son of man in the tomb
I see the soldiers, comin' from out the shadows
Ready for battle, ain't trying to hear the baffled
Warriors lined up in full war gear
In it to win it if it goes on for years
Dedicated to the stable of the Assassins
Revolutionaries, just bring on the action
(Wyclef)
Soldier man
Rewind selector soldier man
Refugee soldier man
Brooklyn soldier man
L.A massive soldier man
New Jersey massive soldier man
Uptown massive soldier man
Long beach massive soldier man
You know the whole world watches soldier man

22,Born To Get Busy,1991,Cypress Hill (1991),,Cypress Hill,"Born to get busy, born to get busy baby
Born to get busy, born to get busy baby
I'm the the stiff and I do get nice
Up the pussy when we in the same party, what
We can do this bro, we can't be maxin'
The figures is useless, unless we're taxin'
This is a perfection and my tribe's the cash dump
Known as a musician, imitator act up
Nobody's kid brother, that means I'm up for this task
And I set out from the beginning to kick a little scratch
Using modern technique, I place a beat in a rap
I went to learn acquire knowledge of a scholar went to college, all
Comes very handy when it comes to pushin shovin and stuff
Then ask who is he though, I'm not the sissy
I'm stiff to neutral brother
And I'm born to get busy
Let us start to freak you and we'll make you feel alright
When you come to Cypress HIll make sure that you're down with the tribe
'Cause we're born to get busy, born to get busy baby
Born to get busy, born to get busy baby
Born to get busy, born to get busy baby
Born to get busy, born to get busy baby
B-b-b-b-busy!
As I stroll the ever ways of the buddha masters
As I smoke my joint I feel one with the earth
But a brother like me keeps on walkin' to get to the next sign
Then blaze the next joint
*short pause, then outro comes on over ""Stoned"" instrumental*
The, physical effects of marijuana
The first sensations may be felt instantly after having smoked grass
or an hour after having eaten
Usually, they creep slowly into this stoned condition
Inch by inch, sliding upward, but to beatnik
The effects may come upon you, suddenly, and startle you full force
(The, physical effects of marijuana)
(There are four basic types of marijuana)
Pyschologically, sometimes the early psychological stages
coincide with the early physical stages experienced while stoned
The famous ""mind expansion"" comes after the famous physical sensation
Grass, heightens and distorts
For example, profound revelations
You may THINK you have profound revelations, only to discover...
*music and fade obscure final words*"
23,Break 'Em Off Some,1993,Black Sunday (1993),,Cypress Hill,"This one goes out to all you punk motherfuckers out there
Yeah, eat a bowl of dick'up fools!
Do ya wanna get crazy?
Commin atcha in 93'!
Through the car swings
The fireing pins go click
When I duck behind the trash bin
Ran out
Of ammo no doubt
My gatt is dry like a fuckin' drought
Got to make my way home
Hit the gate and get my chrome
God damn this song
They got me cornered
Lemme just warn ya
I'll pull this trigga make your family mourn'ya
Boo-hoo!
Where ya gonna run to
When I pull out the scooby do
Run

Hit the floor 'cause it ain't no fun
But here they come they must wanna get done
No frontin'
Punk I'll break ya off somethin'!
1 2 3 that coppa goes down!
(Break'em off some)
What the fuck I'm rollin'
In a mack truck that's stolin
Guess what I'm holdin'
Ammmo to bust my load
Still I'm easin on down
The yellow brick road
Whatta ya know?
A pig in a plain brown wrapper
He wanna bring me down
I'll hit that corna
Lemme just warn ya

21 gun saloot
Trying to take my loot
Don't make me shoot
I'll hit my blunt
And pass you a load
And punk
Let me break ya of something
Break em' off some
I got to roll with the self control
In the green tank
When the shit unfolds
Hold up
I got it sewn up
Me and my niggas
Are about to blow up
Got the pigs on my tail
What they get
Is the hollow point shell
Caught in the sail
Servin' my sentence
Got my apprentice
In the hood
But the nigga is senseless
Out on parol
Now the nigga has turned to my fold
Now the punk gotta go
That punk got shady
Woudn't repay me
Let the punk know that ya still can't fade me
Maybe the fucker would stop
But nothin' would stop me
From havin' to break'em off something
On to the next spot kid
Break'em off some
We ain't havin' it y'all

25,Busted In The Hood,2004,Till Death Do Us Part (2004),,Cypress Hill,"WELLLLLLLLLLLLLL... here's a little story, I got to tell
About a thugged out homey, I know so well
It started way back, when I was a teen
In the hood, on the corner, slangin dope to fiends
Had the little stash that could serve your need
You can do what you want but I got weed for me
Ridin' for my fam, tryin' to hit a grand
CRASH unit on my ass, now I'm in demand
One lone-ly fami-ly I be
All in the hood, I got no-bo-dy
The sun is beatin' down on my red dark hat
Pigs are roamin through the alley so I gotta toss my gat
Forgot about the sack, lookin' for a place to hide
If they ask me for my name - fuck 'em, I'ma lie!""
One O.G. gangsta I be
Busted in the hood, I got no more weed
Pigs are comin' down on my gangsta stash
When they caught me with the weed, and the dope and hash
(B-Real)
He said a little somethin', I wasn't so impressed
No more runnin' homey, now you're under arrest
The sack was in my hand, felt like a sack of bricks
I swore he couldn't see it when I threw it in my whip
He said he wanted some, I said I don't have none
Found it in the sun on the floor next to my gun
Next thing I saw was the gun to my head
Now the lead will make me dead, and yo this is what he said
(Sen Dog)
My name is Sgt. Slacker with a license to kill (uh-huh)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get real (yeah)
Now what do we have here? A banger and his peers
(B-Real)
He cuffed my hand you understand he threatened me with tears
Sorry motherfucker had his gun out with a grin
You think the story's over but it's ready to begin
(Sen Dog)
Now I got your crack and most of your crew
You got a couple choices of what you can do
Better make the right decision if you know what I mean
You can do some time, or fork over your green
(B-Real)
I said I got no green he started lookin' at me harder
I said I don't have nothin' you can go fuck your daughter (WHAT?)
He hit me with the fist, he hit me with the gat
He put the night stick to my back, so
I think I'm done, the pig's got my gun
It isn't lookin' good, I got ink on my thumb
Another pig walked in, said he's playin' games
He gave another look at me, found out my false name
(B-Real)
Sittin' there pissed as I dwell in my cell
The place smells like shit, in the County Jail
Homey lookin' at me like he seen me before
He started throwin' up a set, then he spit on the floor
I think ay-yeah yo, I know this kid
It's the same motherfucker cocktailed my crib
This dude said - get ready - pulled a shank on me
I said c'mon homey you a bit too sloppy
Fool tried to stab me, socked him in the eye
The guards yelled, ""Give it up!"" and let two fly
The guards said down and we hit the floor
If you make a move after you won't move no more
He said I think you once again best protect ya neck
I said eat a dick from me you don't get respect
I said you wanna come with it, any time and place
And I'll leave you like Pacino with a Scar-on-ya-face
They put him in the hole, and all the bullshit stopped
But when his boy had beef, yeah he got dropped
P.D. had no witness, D.A. dropped the load
I got probation for the gun and the dope, case closed"
26,Can I Get a Hit,2000,Skull & Bones (2000),,Cypress Hill,"Handle it, handle it
You know, motherfuckers need to have some weed etiquete
True, true
You see, motherfuckers try to come up and bogard your weed
At the club, and they don't wanna share theirs
Can I get a hit of your weed (repeats in background 6X)
(B-Real)
You know I hate it when I roll a joint and give it to somebody
Who ain't got weed but they wanna be up in the party
Laughin' and gigglin, sippin on a Heinie
Son you need a Tic Tac your breath is gonna blind me
Talkin' about you wanna hit, spittin' in my eardrum
Oh you new in the cypher, step to the rear son
Still they manage to hit it, and put they grip on it
That's when they wet the tip and put they lips on it
Then when you get it, forget it, it's been wetted
Who gonna hit it now, not me, you got me
Thinkin' about these fuckin' jokers, double tokers
Smokers who hit it like they suckin a dick, fuckers
Flippin it, lovin' it, smokin' it to the head
Givin' it to me half way down, ""thanks again""
Then when you see 'em later smokin' they own stash
When you ask 'em for a hit, they say, ""sorry this is my last""
I shared some with you, ""Sorry that's not my problem
Talk to the hand but I got plenty if you wanna buy some""
These people piss me off, this is true indeed
But nothin's worse when someone's askin for some weed
What do I look like a tree where the bud grows
Here pick my left nut and smoke it in the bol
Or better grow your own leave mine alone
Here I'll give you a clone now raise up outta my zone
I know I got the best weed, but don't make me
Make your burnt chest bleed what you need
Is weed etiquette, please don't be offended
'Cause the weed costs money I'm the one who has to spend it
And that's just the way it is man
Y'all motherfuckers need to learn
You just can't come, askin for some shit and not givin' none in return
What the fuck is that man? We goin' into 2000 motherfucker
You need to learn how to smoke some weed with people
Pass it to the left motherfuckers
Can I get a hit of your weed (repeats to the end)"

So you can peep this, tragedy had to be in your mind soakin in
Sad to see you broken down, not at least broken in
Can't stop some Hill shit from comin' through

Ways and things change, with strange haids of braids shade

Five roll with the weakest
What you need is, the chrome plated heater
So you can peep this, tragedy had to be in your mind soakin in
Sad to see you broken down, not at least broken in
Can't stop some Hill shit from comin' through
The reality is out with the old, and with the new
Ways and things change, with strange haids of braids shade
Switch place life and life plays with thumb pay
Does and un-trues, the mule leaves no clues
In the dark confused, we choose to eat you
Out the whole stroke away so I can listener
We don't stop if you can, fuck commissioner

29,Carry Me Away,2010,Rise Up (2010),,Cypress Hill,"(Feat. Mike Shinoda)
(B-Real)
I was an outcast, outsider, trouble maker
A lost soul, outta control, in danger
Didn't have a care in the world, my feeling were numb
Never showing emotion I is easy for some
I don't know how it happened, how I got to this point
But I needed a way out, I was stuck in a void
I needed another path or I'd self destruct
I was down on my luck, my head was so fucked
A menace rollin' the streets is what I was
Holdin' my heat and rollin' with the serious thugs
You couldn't tell me a thing, I was like my brother
Words went in one ear and out the other
Slangin' and bangin', with a chip on my shoulder
An insane, hit the brain certified street soldier
So close to the grave, you at an early age
Can't tell you the price I've paid
(Mike Shinoda - Chorus)
Oh, the sky overhead is like a canvas of grey
I dunno how much time I'll be given to stay
From the first break of light to the end of the day
I'm just livin' my life till they come carry me away
(Sen Dog)
I've been there in LA nights in the block where I came up
My pops used to hate when we hanged with them bangers
Guess he knew one day that we'll become us
That's just how it is when you live where we come from
""Fight, don't run"" is the motto we live by
Get 'em on the ground and stomp a mind about ten times
Sure we was just kids back then
I had no remorse for what we did back then
Six of us, one call, we'd all pack in
Hit the strip, and go and get the shit crackin'
Gun wars, and drug deals, I seen 'em happen
When I started losin' home boys I wasn't laughin'
I looked all around and seen none of 'em there
That's when I figured out, that nobody cared
If we lived or die, we'll just get high and ride
And I wasn't gonna let this happen one more time
(B-Real)
My mother was there for me every step of the way
She didn't judge me, she told me I'd win some day
When I was at my lowest, when I had no focus
She pulled me out the gutter, said I wasn't hopeless
Every night she prayed for me, I was out on the street
Chillin' on the corner with the hand on my heat
Eyes open wide for the pigs and foes
It's an every day hazard when you hustle for dough
So many nights I didn't come home, she thought the worst
Maybe somebody shot me down without any remorse
Maybe I hurt somebody and I was stuck in a cell
Well I regret all those time that I put her through hell
When I reflect back on those days, my heart aches
And everybody I lost or let down, I wish I could take it all back
And make it better but I can't so I try to make amends
And be there, through thick and thin
Come carry me away
Come carry me away
Come carry me away
Come carry me away"
30,Case Closed,1998,IV (1998),,Cypress Hill,"(Sen Dog)
Motherfucker with one little single
Three or four Caimans under your belt
One good game gonna put you in the Hall of Fame motherfucker, nahmean?
Got one hit think you an all star baby
Ha, you sure got somethin' to learn, rookie ass nigga
It's the big hill baby, stand strong motherfucker, what
(B-Real)
Don't trip when you hit the lunatic, transmit ah shit
Break it down for the bitches and don't slip
You wish, get a grip you talkin' with loose lips
Runnin' your mouth, give you a tip, eat a dick
Huffin and puffin now you the man, understand this
Dumb motherfuckers explode up in the push persist
Keep movin with no lyrics, your spirit's broke
Sounds like you got a dick caught in your throat
Huh, hit wood-a takin' you under a down low
Shitting on your one single and carry O's
Hold up; let me slow down the catch up
Before you open up your mouth for the kick to the gut
Pure breed, raw killer, rhyme thriller
Spit fire like Godzilla, the mad willer
Swingin' over the beat, you ready, hold steady
You come across, biting the bullet and be the boss
Hard, sit-cars, you wanna floss guitars quick
You rapping like you wrapping your lips around my dick
Nobody told me to stop until I bust in your face
Got your rhyme Puffy, sprayin the mace, the case closed
Expose the whack nigga who chose to pose high
Figure burial, up in the hills, the gravedigger, nigga
(Chorus: B-Real)
Rookies got a single, they think they all pro's (yeah, you can man)
Not one album mounting, they thinkin' they got close (motherfucker, you bitch)
I rock shows, tell me what you know about those
I'm annihilating all of my foes, the case closed (bite your ass)
Rookies got a single, they think they all pro's
Not one album mounting, they thinkin' they got close
I rock shows, tell me what you know about those
I'm annihilating all of my foes, the case closed
Rookies got a single, they think they all pro's
Not one album mounting, they thinkin' they got close
I rock shows, tell me what you know about those
I'm annihilating all of my foes, the case closed
Rookies got a single, they think they all pro's
Not one album mounting, they thinkin' they got close

31,Catastrophe,2001,Stoned Raiders (2001),,Cypress Hill,"B-Real
I slay punks who don't know their own identity
You spit my name and use it like an obscenity
You got more skulls in your closet than a Kennedy
You on my nuts so you better hold tenderly
I can tell you what's crackin' and done get splitten
You corrosin' on the floor, shaken and snake bitten
You in a cold sweat like James of the names you knew
Don't mean shit to me and you ain't got a clue
Of what's about to happen - interaction
Two worlds collide - one survives the reaction
Hold tight, keep yourself together
'Cause we're about to storm you like shitty weather
(Chorus: B-Real and Sen Dog)
(B-Real)
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
(Sen Dog)
Set yourself up for catastrophe and that's the only way that is has to be
The whole damn world is mad at me
But I don't give a damn, I'm just glad to be
All pain and the fame a society, actuality, it's a formality
How can I say: ""You ain't shit to me""
Without you takin' it personally
Sen Dog
Ten, proper years of bringin' funk
I, still count mine, it's hella gettin' over the hump
I got the loads on the skull, I got my hand on the pump
Still got the boss to go nutty on you punks (yeah!)
I don't wanna be the King of the Sing
Just a Soul Assassin for the Cypress Team
I rhyme and sing and make bitches scream
They love that old South Side gangsta lean
Call the Psycobeta, I guess you're crackin'
Turn into Mad Dog when I start rappin'
Look at hostile - ah, damn wild
Shake you up in a hurry from the voodoo child
Don't get caught up hangin' on the mortar
Hold on and I'll turn y'all punks all wild
(Chorus: B-Real and Sen Dog)
(B-Real)
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe

Set yourself up for catastrophe and that's the only way that is has to be

Without you takin' it personally
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, come on!
B-Real
I'm tired of whack rappers and fame seekers
Like you know the deal to be in my same sneakers
I don't mind exposin' you hollow bitches
I got the medicine over the swallow bitches
You play roles like an actor but get no oscar
Gun spray, gunned away, cut from the roster
You're just an imposter, you lost your composure
Respect your exposure to bring you to your closure
But you're in denial and still remain vile
In a place within last style and senseless wild
I take you down the long trail you failed to keep up
That's when you get introduced to the street sweeper
(Chorus: B-Real and Sen Dog)
(B-Real)
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself up for catastrophe
I can see what you see what you asked for it has to be
You set yourself UP FOR CATASTROPHE!

Set yourself up for catastrophe and that's the only way that is has to be
The whole damn world is mad at me

Call me the serial rhyme killer
Mic-cord strangling, mangling, tangling, you in the web nigga
Your head is dangling off of your shoulders
Cause my mic told me to do it cause you wasn't a true soldier
Fake bustas get hit with the clusterbomb
You're a hotdog with no mustard, you're flusterd, I'm calm
Spit heat like a fucking dragon, bagging you up
Tagging you toe, zipping you up
Clipping you up, mic-cord tripping you up
You're in the dark with no light
And wishing a nigga had lit you up
So much for wishful thinking, you're body's stinking
You're sinking into the hole and I'm at the top winking at ya
(Sen-Dog)
Don't play me too close I'm a certified bomb
Designed to designate all over the tape
Got my Cuban Puertoricans all up in the place
Gonna smash you in the face with tapes check it out
(B-Real)
Call me imperial beatslayer
All prayers try to be advisory to rivalry in the battle player
Bitches who lie to me and cry to me use bribery
I'm taking the torch and burn Puffy-music for canivalry
That'll teach you I beat you on every plain
Ain't no other way to reach you, I reach you with pain
Shred you into pieces using the tigerclaw
I'm a cold nigga you need more than a lighter to thaw
Me and my lyrical Iceberg suckers are panic
Fuck what you heard I brought down the Titanic
So can it and shut it, I wrote it and bust it
Because it never gonna be safe for wack niggas I don't trust 'em
(Sen-Dog)
Call me superior showstopper, your hiphop legacy
Claim us to remember we break you off proper
Oh you got a short memory? You wanna render me?
Harmless and surrender me for the fucking enemy?
I won't let ya I bet ya I reign supreme
Make your fans forget ya search ya in front of your team
Make a nigga smoke a ounce and bounce over the rhythm
And hit 'em and get another suck and hit 'em with venom
Nigga my name is Sen and I'm real while you're pretending
Suckers with no style I hope you get offended
So I can lock your ass up with my jawclutches
Then my rhymes will catch you 'cause they're sharp like Tony Touch's
(Sen-Dog)
Yeah, that's right y'all
Gonna smash you in the face
Who be coming on touching me, getting around me
I'm a bomb you know what I'm saying
I'm ready to go off you know what I'm saying
So many motherfuckers out there talking shit, doing their little thing
It's cool you know what I'm saying, go ahead make you money
But don't you be coming around me perplexing playing like a bitch
You know what I'm saying
'Cause I can see your ass right through you know what I'm saying
You're glass homeyboy, you're glass you know what I'm saying
Don't play me too close y'all
I don't think I like you too much you know what I'm saying
Always kicking it, doing what we do
Trying to act like us, trying to sound like us
You're playing me too close motherfucker
You need too step the fuck on back
Take your ass on back to wherever the fuck you come from
You're playing me way way too close you know what I'm saying"

Sirens blare, niggas wildin' out over chairs
The men here, so sealable doors, so stand clear
Breath takin', niggas rollin' up with the gat shakin'
No puss here, brothers sadly mistaken
The chains breakin', back to check the rules you fakin'
That's violation, like a Muslim eatin' bacon
Much got the beat breakin', faggots niggas instigatin'
I'm runnin' with the law while you triple six in your Satan
Comin' in blastin', with no maskin', niggas askin'
""How he lastin'?"" Jewels, with the tool flashin'
Blacked out now I'm lacked in, I'ma second win
More oxygen, niggas on my jock again

Runnin' with the PMD, universal, no rehearsal
Controversial, no commercial
All rough and rugged, you buckin' off at the straight thuggin'
Audio thumpin' and head bumpin'
Motherfuckers wanna hear somethin', CD's jumpin'
Thumpin' the ground all of a sudden
In the mist of the smoke I shut it - all competition
Set the condition to submission
From the contact I'm sparkin' at brain cells
Through songs and magazines and through the e-mail
I'm worldwide, six side, killafornia highs
No time, define, no wolfs, we need the blind
To the slaughter, I'm baptizin' you through the water
Pure hip-hop and D makes you grow like weed, proceed
That's right, Soul Assassins, the Hit Squad, Cypress Hill
All up in your dome piece

...Keep the house bumpin', we be the champions
Get the announcements, keep the whole house bumpin'
You want somethin', we the champions
Keep the house thumpin', get announcements
Let them know that you won bitch, we be the champions

It's time to strike!
(B-Real)
Let the rain pour down from God above
With the blood of my blade, no love, begin the flood
Open the gates, let the battle begin, wherein
With wind at our backs, ready for any attacks
Sound the horns, prepare for war, begin the storm
The flaming arrows hitting your body, keeping you warm
With the uniform of my sworn enemies
You raped and pillaged my city, and spread disease
Feel the sword of the warrior's wrath, the path you take
Can lead to the math that the master's break
The clash of the titans, are you frightened of loss
Fighting with the cause to free, you and yours, and God's law
Look in the stars, aligned with sign and Mars
Destruction, what's your function, you roll with God
Attention (2x)
(B-Real)
The soul of the master's elements, disaster
Breaking ya faster, transmitting the broadcaster
The blade swings, slashing your throat
The vision's on the mission, seeking the note
Dropping the bomb, by remote
Load up the cavalry's, no salaries, the keys
The life's memories, strife bringing the thieves
Cut the heads off, hide in the loft, don't even cough
Or breath, pay the cost, moving your life's lost
Let the spirit reunite, with your weapon, you wanna fight
Hear the sound of the warriors stepping into the night
The eye in the sky, looking to punish ya, never hide
No cover to shelter your life, the souls begin to rise
And to clash
Attention (2x)
(B-Real)
God's enemies, fall in upon, the knees crawling
Beheading the dead souls, who runaway from their calling
Behold, the white horse, remorse, never the case
Every corner of the world, the battle is taking place
Let the war drum set the pace, you face fire
Resume, from the Temple of Boom, and seek higher thought
Maybe you live, or maybe not, the blade's hot
Many renegades ready for battle, die on the spot
With one shot, one whole city becomes rocked
The clash rages on, people remain calm
Good, bad, all in the balance, you going mad
You can never tell, heaven or hell, the blood shed
And it's all around, you can't run, sit in the cell
When the war's over, the light will shine, covering the spell
Celebrate now, put the blades to rest
No wickedness, only the blessed will hold down
Attention
You creating hysteria

41,Dead Man's Gun,2010,Rise Up (2010),,Cypress Hill,"(B-real)
It was a cold dark night in December
Running from the po-po's the alleyway I enter
Trying to hideaway when I stumbled on a gun
And nobody's knows nothing about where it came from
And nothing hotter then the summers in June
Who knows how many souls they put in the tomb
When I picked it up man, I felt alot of pain
Like a shot through the brain for reasons I can't explain
After it went away I felt a sudden change
Like, I can do anything and don't get in my way
I'm scared for my family
They couldn't understand with gun in my hand I became another man
No more running and hiding away from the cops
No more getting robbed from the dudes on the block
You're looking at a new man in the light of the sun
You're staring down the barrel of a dead man's gun
'Cause you never know what's around them corners
Enemies try to run up on us
So I keep that gun right by my side
If you want it you gotta take my life
And if you got problems I got answers
One shot from the revolver, can solve it
Anyway you want it, it don't matter
If you got hard, imma go harder
(You gotta take my life)
(B-real)
You walk into a dream and shit feels like a game
Everyone is different but they all end up the same
Even the places and the faces all change
At the end of the dream, I could see the bullets rain
I thought it was me who brought these people to the death
Till I noticed a funny thing, I was standing on the left
Looking at other people with their hands on the gun
And pulling the trigger until their enemies were done
And with each hand that held the gun it got deeper
They ended a question against the shoulder of the Reaper
They all look invincible with the weapon that was cursed
Until it was their turn to ride in the hearse
Seems like the history is passing down to me
'Cause my finger was itching to go after my enemies
I welcome them all with the best on my chest
Because I put 'em to the test
And laid those bodies to rest
'Cause you never know what's around them corners
Enemies try to run up on us
So I keep that gun right by my side
If you want it you gotta take my life
And if you got problems I got answers
One shot from the revolver, can solve it
Anyway you want it, it don't matter
If you got hard, imma go harder
(You gotta take my life)
(B-real)
Spring for more pimpin'
Time passes by
And people are telling me about the look in my eye
Sayin' it seems there's a chip on my shoulder
And for some reason my attitude has gotten bolder
I knew it was true 'cause I felt myself changin'
But I don't care what they think 'cause I'm still the same man
I don't show weakness anymore without a question
Don't wanna be stressin' and have to teach them rappers a lesson
Never a time I felt so alive and situations I thrive like bees to a hive
I murder these new kids who got something against me
The thought of you talkin' shit really fuckin' offends me
In no time at all we come back to each other
Seems like I've seen it before
Swear it on my mother
Shot rang out and my hands went numb
Body on the floor with the dead man's gun
'Cause you never know what's around them corners
Enemies try to run up on us
So I keep that gun right by my side
If you want it you gotta take my life
And if you got problems I got answers
One shot from the revolver, can solve it
Anyway you want it, it don't matter
If you got hard, imma go harder
(You gotta take my life)
(You gotta take my life)
(You gotta take my life)
(You gotta take my life)
(You gotta take my life)"

The darkness frightens you even more,
I'm here to enlighten you with the hard-core.
Bring it raw,
Like the red dead meat up in your plate,
And I'll fill you up with the energy
The Hill creates.
I get sticky
Like the green bag of the bom diggy,
Now I'm fuckin' with your head
And you're realizing its tricky.
Got you paranoid fellin the void,
You can't take it,
Or avoid being destroyed freakazoid.
Toyed with your mind all styles deployed
You find danger,
In the stranger eye's the killin' comes second nature.
Your battlefield of the mind is falling
Now who you callin out for help,
And all your fuckin' yellin' is to your self.
Crawlin and beggin for mercy means nothing
When your bluffin I'm pushin the button
And straight dumpin on fools frontin.
Warpigs you dig,
SIG kickin up Mr. Big
Take a sip of wine
Engage in a battle of the mind.
You're feelin' the force
Right from the source,
Ain't no remorse,
Your head is getting fucked
And I'm skippin the intercourse.
Behold the white horse
Your taking a loss neighbor,
Got the nina ross,
Don't lean across my fuckin' paper.
Chase a green back gladiator
Terminator, seed germinator
The greater the risk you fuckin' hater.
Hit you the psychobeta
Clickin the fader slow, with the high low
Servin' a blow who got the glow.
Dead men tell no tales
You fail to see the reason,
I'm easin to squeeze the grigger
Go figure its killin' season."

Greenhouse effect with the weed connect

HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
Or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growin' without no permit
But fuck that, I study the 215 trip

People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinkin' and drivin' and swervin
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the cush plant brushin a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowin' a fuckin' smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut groves
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood
Sticky angel, I neva wanna leave green alone
But never ever ever got a warrant for my home
What that funny sound knockin' at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (taxi!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop
Get locked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growin' my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growin' like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb

Just tell me just pass me watch me I'm truly tampering y'all
Must be simple delinquent to try to get what the sick is
So leave the hard is to limp it and only the thrill will we get it?
I'm an assassin of soul out of control when I roll
You better hide in your hole I got your name on my skull
There ain't no running from me assassin of hunees you see
Blastin at those who obye blasting at last at the weak!
Do what you want do what you need the hardcore
Breaking the law the new seed yes they want more

Excess of the zes make it sound right beat it up all you want it's a damn

But anyway, (everybody must get stoned (x4))
You over there singin' some shit, talkin' 'bout

Hit the joint, up the bomb, take a puff
Till you just can't get enough
Of the sunk a punk
Pick an endo, wanna take control
But the primaso puff on the endo (keep puffin')
Let me take it in then I let it out (let it out)
One of you motherfuckers pass the barred owl
Peace to the niggaz in all the Budha spots
Slangin' fat bags o' weed and runnin' from the cops
(Runnin' from them fools)
I hit the leno then pass it on
To the cypha' of dreadlocks gettin' stoned

>From the fat joint twisted at the end
'Cause I get high with a little help from my friends (from my friends)
Everybody must get stoned
I said everybody must get stoned
(Everybody must get stoned)*variations*

Hit the blunt of the bong, take your dope
Now my head's in a cloud of smoke and no joke
Called 'the uptight', motherfuckers puttin' me down
'Cause I talk about the green shit in every town (Everywhere I go)
You right in front of me, I can't see ya
I'm blind and faded and I get the G-rock
And everything's gonna be all right
When I pass that toochi from the left-hand side
Niggaz is havin' a good time tonight
Roll it up, hold it up, pass me the fucking light
(Gimme that lighter) Indoor on the home-grown
Light it up, everybody must get stoned (gotta get stoned)

You know how we talkin' to talk
We say, stoned is the way of the walk (x4)

47,Feature Presentation,1998,IV (1998),,Cypress Hill,"(Barron Ricks)
My flows most beneficent, most merciful, outrageous
For wages, vibrate niggaz heads like pagers
Too hard to handle son, we animals, biohazardous
Ghetto evangelist, lyric distortions, abortions
Of fortune shit, shittin on your ASR-10 Sequence
Fuckin' up the disc
These be the words blow niggaz acoustic nerves
When I swerve I'm bustin' adjectives and verbs at curves
Hear the thunder then I melt the frozen tundra, sank Titanics
Crack solid granite, initiate global panic
Harlem got me branded, rhythms jingle like bricks
These niggaz face it or face off, give up or break North
My lines petrify your mind's third eye, when I'm high
I pull the trey in your insides, I strike blindside
Rip inside, my syllables simmer for every criminal
In prison whose an individual lose that struggle
My stories burst niggaz bubbles, make new niggaz mumble
Ready to shed blood up in the jungles
Aiyyo we livin' it, magnficent
Cypress, worldwide!
(B-Real)
I take the micraphone cord, use it as a rope
To hang all the weak rappers for leavin' the bullshit they wrote
Counterfeit fools all in the pot, let 'em boil
When we go platinum they go, aluminum foil
The worldwide clicks and the parties with no parties
Cause niggaz'll get you quickly like the skin off a blunt
When they get burned and smoked, put out and used up
Niggaz don't know how to act when they lit the fuse up
Abuse them up, usin' the nut, I'm usin' buck
Fearin of the shit, that's covered the script, deliver cuts
Cypress Hill, Soul Asassins, all up in the club
Showin love to everyone of you real niggaz
Cause the hip-hop's pumpin through the blood in my veins
Like a junkie, fuckin' with 'ron and cocaine
Slay you both down, better hold down or get clowned
By the world renowned, Cypress compound!
(Chace Infinite)
Heavy artillery rap niggaz attack from both sides
Of the map, leave you flat on your back, my thoughts dwell
In the dark black abyss, Chace Infinite kicks
Rhymes over rhythm and spit hot flame from his lips
I represent, the cream of the earth, bless his birth
My order in the elements in the universe
My mental enter your physical frame, penetrate
Like pushin your face straight through a window pane
With twenty bars, I'm sinister God, administer pain
To your paragraph it ain't hard, see I studied the life-science
For years in this, doin' songs with my indigenous
Peers 'n' shit, hit you with the omnipotent gland
The benficient stare, write a rhyme to shine light
In your ear, don't make a move that'll end your career
Stand clear, I stand firm on solid ground
Pump Blood Sweat and Tears, verbal architect, engineer
Shiftin your ear, to Cypress Hill, you wack niggaz
Caps is peeled, the scientific Soul Asassin
We dominate tracks and thrash in the front lines
Soldier ready for action, rapid fire rappin'"
48,From the Window of My Room,1998,IV (1998),,Cypress Hill,"(B-Real)
Now lately I've been findin myself, pourin my guts out
Expressin my thoughts, lettin my nuts out in the walls
Of sleep, I can't keep it all in the hall clear
While others keep it inside for the pride they hold dear
Shoulda been, woulda been, coulda been the cops
Stop look and listen, you'll get a vision of hip-hop
Individuals lookin' to the battle the shadows of man
See it all, be it all, you need a plan
It takes one man to understand this
Learn fuckin' with a deadly gas, you get burned
From the window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Of living it's all given to you, don't lose it
Every man's given a tool, but don't use it
(Chorus: B-Real)
From the window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, the high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burnin up see
The window of my room, I shoot all stars
Every little bit you consume, is high cost
Break free, you're selling your soul, for a fee
But all that shit ain't worth it, you burnin up see
(B-Real)
From the window of my room, the gloom spreadin across
The land of milk and honey, no money to feed the boss
Funny the cost of life, cut clean blood streams
Out the body, nobody wants you dreamin' about shorty
No longer don't need a 40 to take away any pain
So punk me and I'll give you the world exact change
Or quote me and you're never the same, I claim no one
I show none the weakness individuals go forth ya seek this
Wherever I roam is home to me
You Shogun, look at my enemies try to do me
The influential status, you know the baddest
Lookie here, show you what that is, bringin' the madness
Sadness to those appealin to any conflict
Lookin' out my window pane, I see you fallin'
What are you a man or a mouse, the house light
Shinin within, that's when you begin to live again
(Sen Dog)
From my window I can see
Humanity, goin' insane G
Everybody want respect, but you gotta collect
Only hardcore vatos on the set
Don't get me wrong but some rhymes get twisted
There it goes, the pride, you missed it
I ain't upset with the motherfucker dissin
Find me in Watts when you wanna come hit me
Some shit ain't what it seems, in the land of dreams
Some sell their soul to get the cream
From the teens I don't sling or slang no crack
I'm known for bringin' in funky ass raps
See those magazine crews and I'm a goner
Dull interviews with these damn primadonnas
Unlike some of these fools on the turf
Look like the real thing, but they soft like Nerfs
So unrehearsed that it shows in the product
Need to get the fuck out, before you get caught up"
49,Funk Freakers,1995,Cypress Hill III (Temple Of Boom) (1995),,Cypress Hill,"Let me introduce myself
I'm the one who rose the cess
So don't you forget
Bad rolled ya help
But you still be trying to push buttons
But you ain't nothing, no fronting
I bring the level up a little louder
In the clubs in the jeeps in the after hours
Fools on the street want to feel the funk
Lookin' for the skunk that's what you want
Ya better, sit back and let the track flow
Like smoke in your lungs from puffing on the endo
Rythems upside ya brain
Can ya hang can ya maintain
Can ya feel the funk flowing in ya veins
Get ya fix and a bag of tricks
And the mixer got the stix and stones a few bricks
I'm gonna hit 'em high, he's gonna hit 'em low
Open up your mind so that you can feel the flow
On and on till there all gone fools be running
But they won't last long
(I'm the freaker) x 8
People always want to get what you got
No matter what
Can't together themselves in the big hunt
In the quest for the crown and the jewels
And the cheese muther fucker please
And the mees want to plot against me
With envy in there hearts
But I rip there sorry arse apart
In a minute I can take it to the limit
Tempreture rising now so highsing
Coming back in with the lows
For the fools
Fucking up beako's and any body for fools (anybody fools)
The number one skunk freaker
A cypress hill beaker (the cypress hill sleaker esse)
Blowing a hole in your speaker
You don't want to test the phero
The real one or the wedo
Slanging rythems to the ghetto
Ya best keep your arse in check (come on)
Little muther f*uckers that show respect
And what's next the big brown taking you down (and what's next)
How you feel when your sorry arse can't hang with the hill (with the hill)
(Little punk)
(I'm the freaker) x4
Can you feel the effects of the chocolate ties
Nobody even knows how I kick the flow
Slow down 'cause your coming up to fast
You might get smacked down
'Cause you got no class
No code now I'm getting down the road
My shits the bomb to explode
Take cover you get blown to bits

All aboard, and jump on the Ganja Bus
We now want the new weed, beat under us
Rollin' up, roll like we thunderous
Somkin' up, Rasta not sprinkle dust
Too much ecstasy, make manna exit us
Too much fantasy, here upon next to us
Fit in ganja weed, always notorious
Sucker censor me, if you feel glorious
We have weed in our cakes and Oreo's
Believe me though, death upon your Marlboro
You want my roll, on someone you hardly know
This Marley grow, no time to move feet
Make it slow, you tellin' me no
Say you want to start the show
Like cool, Johnny Depp and you want to blow
You shot, direct; that means you are far bellow
You start to take, substances up in your nose
(Chorus: Damian Marley - 2X)
No nina where you find me
Some boy go rich, blow ninety
And smokin' like a genie
The skunky and the greenie

On the ganja bus, they comin' after us
We makin' stops all over Los Angeles
On the block, where the weed that get scandalous
When we run around, police can't handle us
They wanna clout the bus, and on the top be us
They never wanna come around, just a rowdy bunch
Tengo el poder, tu no aguantas
Yo sé, que el juego es dificil para usted
Despiertate, no dejes to gente ver
Tu situacion cuando no puedes mantener
En fuerza que nosotros, enseñale
Deja tu vida sin rastros, escondate
Portate, we flyin' up tu +santrope+
And if you want we can jet through Montego Bay

Cuando fumo yo no juego, pásame el fuego
Me lo fumo todo, quememe los dedos
En la mañana cuando me levanto
Antes que nada, yo quemo un pipaso
Enamorado con la yerba buena
Comida cubana y las nalgas morenas
Todas las nenas saben que yo tengo
Las colitas, vete en mi leño
No hay nadie que me quite el vicio
Marihuano por vida, oiste chico?
Mundo entero quiero que me entiende
La cara virgen wanna va tu mente

It's so hazardous
Take a strive with us
When it's over California, we react the bus
We fabulous, your talk don't mean jack to us
Better fear for your ass the assassins come

For you conniving mothafuckers wanna stash it up

60,High Times,1998,IV (1998),,Cypress Hill,"Now this some baaad weeed...
(B'Real:)
The very first time I hit the weed I was young
Coughin up a lung, high strung, back in '81
Goin' to school, hittin the buddah behind the bleachers
Comin' to class high, sellin the lye to the teachers
Nickel bag, nickel bag, dime to a nickel
Sellin joints to the honeys suck it like an icicle
Others wanted the 40 but I wanted the weed
While everybody was runnin' out, I was plantin my seeds
Homegrown, backyard boogie, I'm still stoned
Got my weed plants taller than your telephone's corner
I can remember when I could only get sess in those days
Now I'm rockin' that chocolate thai, skunk and the haze
Roll a fat one, pass it to the left don't front
But I hate it when they don't take the seeds out the blunt
A bunch of blunt-rollers are like rookies on the field
Spillin the weed plant fuckin' dookies with no skill
I should write a book, how to roll it then pass it
Light it, grow it, sell it and then divide it
Mr. Greenthumb, Dr. Weed, I proceed to give the herb man what they need
True indeed, blow your fuckin' smoke up in the sky
And get high with your bong or your philly or dutchess give me a light
Grab the weed up, pack it in, put it in the pipe
Light it up, smoke a bowl, we puffin the lye right
Put your finger on the hole and hold it in brother
Take a puff, that's enough, and pass it to another
Get the weed sack, smoke it up, till it's all gone
No roaches up in the ashtray, smoke up all the bomb
I usta spend money but now I'm growin' the crops
But I hate it when the pigs throw a raid on the spot
It was once said I smoke so much weed, by a brother
That I look like the nigga on the zig-zag cover
Maybe I usta look like that way back when
When my nigga Sen Dog was around sippin on the Hen
Let the fly rhymes smother you with the scent of the skunk
We got the High Times cover shows you how to roll a blunt
Quarter pound, quarter pound, pound to a quarter
Makin' trips to Mexico runnin' down to the border
Long hairs, bald heads, dreads and punk rocks
Kids of all colors be puffin it down the block
I got the weed on lock with all the hydro methods
Call me Puffy 'cause I makin' and takin' a hit record
Blow your fuckin' smoke up in the sky and get high
With the bong, philly or dutchess, give me the light"
61,Highlife,2000,Skull & Bones (2000),,Cypress Hill,"(B-Real)
I rolled you up like my Rizla
Cut you up, with my sisters
You wanna get us - yeah, the venom spitters
Your style's trash: don't litter
You got the jitters the hardhitters
No quitters your soul quivers
When you see the gats blazin', get out the street now
There ain't no use for you beggin to turn the heat down
You label me coldblooded
You wanna warm me up with hot lead the gat thudded
You can't cut it
You wack, but it's - no use your mouth shut it
Shootin arrows diamond-studded, and still budded
You got to love it, you better chase the paper all day
So you can walk down the long platinum hallway
But now the fools are minutemade;
They get played for a minute
Then played out they never get back in it
Gun park I bring chalk for your body outlined on the floor
You got hit by the 4-4!
(Chorus: B-Real)
You're in the game called life, son - how you're livin' it
Street corner kids growin' up blowin' up
You chase dreams you want the highlife, with the skylights
But in the end your soul's lost, you lost the shine right
Never turn your back ever, on niggaz true to you
Stand alone for the cheddar - and they'll be through with you
The highlife; yeah, the highlife
The highlife; yeah, the highlife
(B-Real)
You gotta hang out with B. Reezy, and take it easy
It's gettin' greasy, I had to learn how to beat me
That's when you go for dolo, and get your meal ticket
And still kick it hardcore I'm runnin' real with it
Niggaz getting softcore, the people want more
Hardcore shit that's why I give them an encore
Curtains opened, you see the people applaud feelin' it
You can't figure out the formula so you're stealin it
Can't stand unoriginal cats with minimal
Skills that's criminal - you fake bitches!
You're lookin' for riches, in the wrong places
The faces of death look you in the eye cut off your breath
When you fall feel your knees shatter
The bones breakin with your weak blatter
Pissin on yourself it don't matter
Dead weight, the bed waits for you on the set date
Dreams gone instead fate didn't hesitate
To put you away, close the gates now you're locked out
Your life: cable, with all the porn channels blocked out (damn!)
What you good for? Nothin', so be gone suckers
Have a nice trip see you motherfuckers!
(Sen Dog)
I live for the highlife, get my mind right
Fuck the fame, the game and the limelights
Fools that be out there tryin' to duplicate
But they can't match the aura, can't impersonate
See the first things that comes to pass, is the blast
Of the Cypress Hill weed funk blazin' up a path
You can't help, but inhale and get strong
You need that good shit all up in your lungs
I live fast, and keep energy in motion
Jah bless, so I feel I been chosen
But I know, This of he who conquers
You gotta come strong and sound off like thunder
I check myself and make sure I'm comin' real tight
Rhyme for my fam, the G's and the highlife

Take cover son or you're assed-out
How do you like my chrome?

Didn't have to blast him

you know what I'm sayin? Heh, and it goes like this""
(B-Real)
Hey, don't miss out on what you're passin
You're missin the hootah of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles, I get wicked
So, come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaw stridin
While suckers are hidin
Jump behind a bush when you see me's drivin by
Hangin out the window
With my magnum takin out some putos
Actin kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street gettin paid from my vocal
Here is somethin you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is somethin you can't understand (what does it all mean?)

(DJ Muggs)
I'm ignorin all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothin is comin from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin around my gat straight hummin
Hummin, comin at ya
Yeah, ya know I had to gat ya
(B-Real)
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin a battle light
Sen got the gat and I know that he'll gat you right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, ""Yo, it's on""
Take cover son or you're assed-out
How do you like my chrome? 
Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him
But I did anyway (ha ha ha)
Young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man
Here is somethin you can't understand (what does it all mean?)
How I could just kill a man

(B-Real)
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I had to establish
To light my spliff
Ignite you with insight
So, if you ain't down, bullshit
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time and play the role model?
No? I think you play like a thug
Next you hear the shot of a magnum slug
Hummin, comin at ya
Yeah, ya know I'm gonna gat ya
How do ya know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been
Understand where I'm coming from?
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here riskin my dome
Just for a bucket or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive
Yo, I gotta say ""fuck it""
Here is somethin you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

70,"I Remember That Freak Bitch (From the Club) / Interlude, Part 2",1998,IV (1998),,Cypress Hill,"(Feat. Barron Ricks)
Aiy-yo!
(B-Real)
I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it
(You get the gloves bitch!)
I used to know this girl that slanged the green shit
Had it all goin' on, but it didn't mean shit
She wanted to be a star, with big cars
And all the fame that came my way I gotta say
That she was all that, and a bag of indo
With no seed, such a delightful weed
I wish she was still around but, no she's gone
I guess she got blessed and she got put on
Aiyyo I miss that girl, she had the bomb, was the
Bomb-diggy bomb bomb, and nope, I'm not Qu'ran
Had all the holy books, and notes to get still
I never met another dealer with that appeal
With those electric eyes, hypnotized
Any wise man surprised, the queen of the lye
(Barron Ricks)
Bee eyes, bouncin' five deep, clicked of innocence
Hangin' with friends, all under surveillance from the government
While Don want tights they floss rights, just chewin on ice
Meditatin with her camp, gettin' damp
She's a pimp or tile freak bitch, high maintenance
She got her fuckin' clit pierced, chained to her anus
Professional for wettin niggaz up, suck 'em first
Till they bust, swallow nut, then she's quick to strut
Right out the projects, been a whore since ninety-one
Suck a niggaz dick for fun, holdin' guns in her buns
Type of chick tell you 'fuck me in the ass' talkin' shit
While she goin' WALLA-WALLA-WALLA-WALLA-WALLA on your dick
(B-Real)
I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it
(You get the gloves bitch!)
Yeah since I seen the queen of green on the screen
So I stepped up, to her screen door, like a dream
Or better yet like a fiend, who need a fix
She wasn't like other chicks, pullin tricks on the scheme for chips
She was like, Run-D.M.C., Tougher Than Leather
Raw bitch, but then she was soft like a feather
Never again will I meet a woman of her nature
SkyPager turned off, datin one of the Lakers
Lucky-ass nigga with the jump shot
He got that hot shit, all in his pocket on lock
Damn I guess I'm jealous that another fella's got with her
But her sister's, bangin' too, what should I do?
Fuck it I'll do like my nigga Smooth with the Princess
Plantin my seed in the next Queen of Buddha Bless
Fuck playin' the second string, on the squad
I'm blowin' up, all in your face, word to God
(Barron Ricks)
Yeah I fucked her in the Hershey Tunnel, deep inside
It made her pussy bubble, aiyyo she told me that it loves you
I told her 'arch that back, let me see that ass'
And then I kissed it, licked it, stuck my nose all in position
You tell me baby listen, can't you see my fuckin' dick is throbbin
She started slobbin and gogglin, spittin' burblin burpin it
I told her 'just don't matter baby, just don't bite it'
No hold barred, my dick was hard enough to dent a car, I stuck it in
Between to spread the Red Sea apart, the pussy fart
Was a motherfuckin work of art, she rode my dick
Just like a Kawasaki till the pussy started soundin sloppy
Like an old jalopy, time to nut
Took off the condom slapped her on the butt, then I bust
On her face in between her lips
Then she started lickin' it, cause it was good shit, protein!
Hot and rich... damn I got my shit freaky, Mr. Ricks
(B-Real)
I remember that freak bitch, up in the clubs
The Victoria's Secret, she give love
No matter which way you keep it
You'll get shoved out the picture, now peep it

71,I Unlimited,2010,Rise Up (2010),,Cypress Hill,"Came back to life, for your protection
Back the dead of resurrection
We came to change the whole completion
Take this game a new direction
Last stop when the gas popped
When the Kush blows free
And the low-lows drop
To photo-opt
No flash
We smash
Get cash
Cash out the fuckin' spot
Itâ•˙s a new day to bill
Expect the hill
We grab the bill
The trip is real
Donâ•˙t make pull out the steal link
Cause all the commotion
And emotions kill
Heat-seekers, if the come seekers
Serve your asses through the big speakers
Anyone, anywhere, we on jack
Blowing up another spot with the contract
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Kill 'em up
Tear 'em up
Put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If he acts tough
Shut him up
Put him down
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Getting high
Let him ride
Put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If you donâ•˙t give a fuck
Blow him up
Put him down
The fear factor
The peri-actor
Adrenalin maxed in bringing the raptor
We cap it and coming at ya
Studio gangsters applying the actra
Still print that real shit
I'm the dog in the cup
And real hard to deal with
How long have we heard you down
And broke down doors with the grimey sound
No surrender, we push and enter
Take over the scene and blaze the green
Put a chill through ya body
When you saw my teeth
Find yourself in the middle
Where the pink convenes
Don't slip on the misfits
'Cause the minute you popshit
The mic gets twisted
Anytime, anywhere we blast off
The right start as parted your ass off
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Kill 'em up
Tear 'em up
Put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If he acts tough
Shut him up
Put him down
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Getting high
Let him ride
Put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If you don't give a fuck
Blow him up
Put him down
We blow smoke in the air to fill the nation
Getting you high no hesitation
So hard to charge, no complication
Take another hit for respiration
Legalise donâ•˙t criticize
'Cause one day you might understand who to symbolise
Any man, any woman gotta like that
First trying put a cape, gotta fight back
Let strip shows, like flip mode
We make you bounce on the track
With sick flows and kick toe
Don't trip in the marsh pit
It's a danger to spray just for salts on toxic
We're phenomenal, so unstoppable
UNLIMITED, your just comical
Stay back, with slate jack (way back)
Payback's a bitch and we know how to play that
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Kill 'em up
Tear 'em up
Put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If he acts tough
Shut him up
Put him down
Bounce bounce bounce bounce
Getting high
Let him ride
Put him down
Jump jump jump jump
If you don't give a fuck
Blow him up
Put him down
Kill 'em up
Tear 'em up
Put 'em down
If he acts tough
Shut 'em up
Put 'em down
Getting high
Let 'em ride
Put 'em down
If you don't give a fuck
Blow 'em up

Ahora tengo feria y ellos me envidian 
Chingan y piden siempre me siguen 
Y al mismo tiempo me dicen: 
No entendemos tu onda 
Con tu cuete, tu dinero y adicto a mota 
Yo nunca quise golpear a vatos 
Pero si me cruzas a mi yo te mato 
6 pies bajo de la tierra 
Yo no miento es verdad 
Ese, quedaras como antes

Me queria bajar la feria este ladron 
Pero no dejo que me maten

Fue un error porque soltaron a un criminal ese 
Yo busco alguien parecido 
Algo como yo, que viva como vivo 
Caminando solo, a mi no me conoce nadie 
Pienso que deveras no valgo madre

Big shouts to all the weed spots and all that who know how we do

Chronically spotting spiral perhaps spinning out wax

Affiliates with my predominately black landscape

83,It Ain't Easy,2001,Stoned Raiders (2001),,Cypress Hill,"(B-Real)
I remember times I hustle, times I struggle
Times I had to get over the everyday shuffle
People tryin' to muffle my thoughts and all my dreams too
People who I thought were down, and see true
But I blame me too 'cause it's a Chronicle
My life, I realise I'm responsible for obstacles
In front of me, my own self to blame
But I worked hard to receive the wealth and fame
It's a worthless game, but if you're willing to play
There's sharks in the water who are, willing to pay
The price of your soul, but if you give it away
You silly motherfuckers are all committed to stay
It's a cold world, but you still want a part of it
So then you'd better fuck around and learn the art of it
Don't walk through life with your blinders on
'Cause you'll keep goin' crazy till your mind is gone
(Chorus : B-Real (repeat 2x))
It Ain't Easy,
But you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you deceive me?
(Sen Dog)
I been around for many days, of musical mainstays
Cypress, is Worldwide and we like it that way
You can't fade-ER, or compare TO
The Original Pyscho-Baiter
Got the next rhyme and we'll check you all later
Can't nobody fuck with them Cypress Hill Raiders
Heard it all before and I don't need no more
Advice on the game and how to kick hardcore
Played the game out here with the best
Toured around the world and got big respect
Now, what's (?) all with this year 2000's?
We puttin' the Smackdown and we ain't clownin'
Not many have lasted
Since we first blasted
Up on the scene, singin' about the dream
Recruitin' for our team, niggas know what I mean
?Damn?, you defy, when you live or die
(Chorus (repeat 2x))
(B Real)
Times I hated, times I waited
Times I went by where I was drunk and faded
They said I wouldn't make it, but where are those people now?
Still hatin', creatin' all the evil now
Your insecurties are showin', exposin' you
You're trippin' on me and showin' emotions too
Don't you spend your life full of envy, it's deadly
Heed me, as I spit the venom believe me
(Sen Dog)
I keep my guard up, and always let you see my rage
I get pissed, like a pitbull in a cage (barking)
Not that many can deal with the fury
Attack and ransack and kill in a hurry
I kill and observe and go in an instant
I bring the pain like the ?Rampark? Prison
I kept it right for the brother to the ?Chullo?
Something I bump when your gates in the (?)
(Chorus: B-Real)
It Ain't Easy,
But you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy
How many times, must you deceive me?
It Ain't Easy,
But you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy

84,It Ain't Nothin',2010,Rise Up (2010),,Cypress Hill,"I used to carry a glock on the waist line, man, I don't waste time
I'm strong on the bass line, you never will taste mine
See me on the screen, fuckers beggin' for face time
Get your own tape but don't bother to chase mine
I got a block, man, we havin' a great time
You couldn't fill the shoes anytime that I lace mine
Light up the stage, for the homies we make shine
Sick the dogs on you, get more by the K-9
Homies on the yard never walk in the main line
The manes find they can never be in the game
I'm lettin' off rounds, hittin' blunts at the same time
Pick crews, homie, you a neon to save time
Bitches like you always spittin' the same rhymes
We put you all to shame, you never went through the same grind
Put you in the bind from the minute you came by
So stay in your lane and get wet by the rain
You wanna step up, get your ass touched
You wanna rap, son, get your ass buff
Try to test us, you's gonna get smashed up
You wanna run with the dogs, get your cash up
Git it, you gotta get your straps up
Git it, you gotta get your stash up
Git it, you gotta get amped up
You wanna run with the dogs, get your cash up
I'm right here on the block
When it's time to ride out, you know what I'm all about
Hundred Harley bikes on site when it goes down
Me and my homies, we always holdin' the fort down
Come up in our town and you're pissin' a fourth now
Got four ounces and three bottles of Jack
Two fifth's in the back and everyone I'm with is strapped
Whatever happened to chin checkin' and wreckin' fools?
Try disrespectin', my Smith & Wesson is endin' you
And I ain't changed since back in the day
Get your shit split quick if you get in my face
You wanna run with the dog, better stay in your place
'Cause your little ass name don't hold no weight
And your little ass safe couldn't hold my cake
Get your asses denied down the road I take
And let me tell you one more thing before I skate
If you a fake or a snake, I'mma send you to your grave
You wanna step up, get your ass touched
You wanna rap, son, get your ass buff
Try to test us, you's gonna get smashed up
You wanna run with the dogs, get your cash up
Git it, you gotta get your straps up
Git it, you gotta get your stash up
Git it, you gotta get amped up
You wanna run with the dogs, get your cash up
Backed up, backed up, backed
Backed up, backed up, backed
Backed up, backed up, backed
Backed up and you bound to get hurt
I'm a First Staff OG from outta the gutter
With a fucked up demeanor for you punk mothafuckas
Get played like some dicks who try to start ruckas
I'm a real gun busta so don't ever try to rush us
Can't nobody touch us that don't leave on crutches
Or worse, get a ride in a hearse with their bodies covered
It's gonna be a cold summer soon as the hilt drops
All bullshit will stop
A couple scums in the street, so we don't care what you bustas think
It might sink in sometime but I won't blink
We go against everything, smoke all the green
Got the low wrong swingin', ain't nothing to me
We put it down anywhere like it's something to see
So all you bitches goin' rogue with your haters degree
And when you wanna get loud, son, I'm ready to work
Punks act up and you bound to get hurt
You wanna step up, get your ass touched
You wanna rap, son, get your ass buff
Try to test us, you's gonna get smashed up
You wanna run with the dogs, get your cash up
Git it, you gotta get your straps up
Git it, you gotta get your stash up
Git it, you gotta get amped up
You wanna run with the dogs, get your cash up"

You wanna jack somebody, never look at me
'Cause I'm like you when I'm holdin' heat
You don't want to think about re-percussions
Cause you don't give a fuck about who you rushin
So what you gonna do when the blood is gushin?
You're playin' Roulette without the Russian
The stakes are high; can you feel the pressure?
Lookin' at the club on top of your dresser
Born for the big bank robbin your own
Thinkin' your stone but your weak ass throne
Bitches like you ain't got no heart
Paranoid, you're settin in, fallin' apart
How many times will you take to see it?
You fallin' away, but you don't believe it

Knock 'em in their face if they dedicate closer

With real attack touch straight, from the ghetto
Walk for a twenty all day like a (Spanish)

Look at you now what road you choosin'

Always poppin' shit and hide from the Hill
Comin' out where you reside for the kill

Aw, man... I've been so out... You got sent from heaven
All right, man, light it up, holmes
Ok, check it out man
I'm the original Dr. Greenthumb the rest are liars
I'm the one with the prescription to get you higher
I got every type of weed that you might desire
Go ahead, fire it up, maybe you can get inspired
Any kind of flavor you savor
I can do you the favor
Just as long as you share with your neighbor
Some like the Sour D, that's an east coast swing
But on the west coast we all know KUSH is queen
Some of y'all will smoke anything, but me, I'm picky
I throw it out if I don't see that it's green and sticky
No stress, no bush, I'm pushing the KUSH
When I harvest put a K on the bag like the Nike Swoosh
I'm over the world, in case you wonder
I smoked everywhere I went, they call me the weed hunter
But no one does it better like we do in Cali
Just ask one of my patients 'cause they always tell me that the...
K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
Kottonmouth Kings are down with us
Snoop Dogg and Dre are down with us
Cheech and Chong, they're down with us
But the DEA, they can get the nuts
On a high times cover, you might see us
Taking hits from the bong with the eight-foot Zong
With weed so strong, that knockout King Kong
Hit it one good time... Your mind's gone
Your eyes get red, and your mouth goes dry
Just get me when you want more and I'll supply
Red and meth said, ""let's gets stoned"" I said ""How High""
They said ""high enough to touch God and kiss the sky""
""That's a tall order But I think I got what you need""
I got the food for though and I'm ready to feed
So, follow my lead I got some gifts to bring
It's an everyday life for the Reefer King
K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit
I got the cream of the crop
My crop means cream
When it's time to bag it up I assemble the team
We're like the Yankees, most winning, grand champs of the herb
Nothing gets you like the type of medicine I serve
Lawyers, teachers, actors, street cleaners
No matter what they are, they all come to see the Reefer
They stay high 24 like Keifer
I tell 'em don't hit too hard, this is a Creepa
Woody Harrelson is down with us
Bruce Willis smokes all, he's down with us
Yeah, Willie Nelson is down with us
Who the fuck you think drives the ganja bus?
Dionne Warwick, she's down with us
She got caught at the airport with joints and such
So if anyone asks, she's down with us
And you don't wanna enter more weed in the Cannabis cup
I'm Greenthumb, I reign supreme, son
A strain better than mine, I've never seen one
The K.U.S.H. keeps you so high that you can't concentrate
Dave Chapelle, is down with us
Halle Barry, too, but don't tell no one
KRS-One is down with us
He's a blunt getting smoked and he can't wake up
K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
The more I smoke, the higher I get
The better I feel, I can't quit

Bust you out the frame, I don't give a fuck who it is

Check my dramatics, brains get splattered, dreams shattered
Sabas get blasted for words he packaged
Peep the sequence; crab adolescents, on his defense
Power-U niggaz talkin' fast like Puerto Ricans
What you seekin', son I catch cream like Dominicans
Last Mohican, lyrics I'm speakin', wild as Indians
Tomahawk - Shaolin slang, the violent talk
Upstate New York, where chumps get extorted for Newports
What you thought?
{B-Real}
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
... That that that I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger
- That I'm ever gonna let ya come back again
Ease back, ease back
Ease back, ease back or I squeeze up on the trigger

""Y ya esta dicho. Todos los que no les guste mi 'rebote' van a morir
Yo le voy a meter una bala a la cabeza a cualquier maricon,
Que no me persiga a mi a la 'singadapuerta'. Oye, hijo puta!
Quiero quemarte la cara!""
{U-God}
Words drop in chant, the cheeky-eyed slant
I'm takin' these cannabis plants yo for grant'
Exotic, narcotic, tunes slam soon
From a dune in the desert Mega-Babylon pleasure
Comin' out the domepiece, smell my aroma
Warrior nomad, put you in a coma
Comma, llama, smash-crashin your armor
Drama, I'm a, stealth aircraft bomber
Here is where I dwell at the gates o' hell
It ain't where you're from it's where you're in the mentals
And if not yo, credentials are essential
I see reality, few things surroundin me
Three like a spread, precise strikes the lyric
Not frontin or braggin, hundred percent red dragon
Pine fragranced lyrics, the rhymes you can't imagine
The globe-trotter, call me Meadowlark Lemon
Five part criminal, two part felon

""Esta dicho! Aqui, la revelacion! No se la ve por television.
Todos los maricones del norte, que los voy a matar yo.
Va a ser aqui en nuestro pais. Y todos los 'singamasones',
Que estan singando un mundo. Tambien, van a ver la muerte
De ellos mismos, lo en las manos de ellos. Un dia, va a ser sangre,
Mucha sangre. La peste de los cuerpos muertos, vas a oir,
Que se va a hueler. Hasta los Estados Unidos, estos cabrones,
Que con la democracia, que nos 'tan singando en el culo.
Todos son unos mismos cabrones..."""
88,Killafornia,1995,Cypress Hill III (Temple Of Boom) (1995),,Cypress Hill,"Livin' in the city of the scandalous, shiesty mother fuckas
Can't even trust my own brothers,
So who can I choose to trust ? me that's who.
Niggas want a piece of the pie, fuck off and die.
Jealous, envious, fools wanna rush this.
Loco cuban ass nigga with the cash shit.
Mother fuckers better get your own
And leave mine alone forty five ways to get domed.
I send out the invitation,
To the party of your elimination.
I got peeps that play for keeps...
Now I'm layin your ass down to sleep.
But every hustler wanna be ballin
But don't got the ball's for the shot callin.
I pull strings, the don king;
Only in America can I hustle and flex my muscle.
Where can I roam to get my hustle on,
Killafornia stackin the chips got the full clips.
Loaded and cocked used to run with a glock;
Nina milimeter sig lightin up the fuckin' block now,
Who you gonna trust? who can you trust?
I don't know, but if your comin' on my corner; I'm gonna bust.
You can't handle us, devious, dangerous,
Criminal mentality, insanity.
I move weight from state to state.
All the niggas movin weight can you relate.
Where can I chill to get my hustle on,
In the alley way comin' up all night long.
Fuck workin at MC' dee's
I'm rollin' with the o.z's, and the q.p's
Puffin on tree's.
Who you gonna trust? who can you trust?
Not that shady mother fucker in the city of scandalous.

89,Kronologik,2001,Stoned Raiders (2001),,Cypress Hill,"Chorus: Kurupt and B-Real (repeat 2x)
You don't know no real shit, nigga (it's the real shit!)
This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga
We numb niggas, ya don't feel shit, nigga
You ain't on no real shit, nigga
(B-Real)
'91 (*echoes*) Cypress Hill burst upon the scene
Three crazy, gun-totin' niggas smokin' weed
Talkin' about life on records was the whole plan
So we put out The Phuncky Feel, (?) and Kill A Man (KILL A MAN! *echoes*)
That was about the time we was openin' up for ?loyalty?
Didn't know shit, we were jus' tryin' to rock the party
'92 (*echoes*) a year later, 'bout a million records sold
From doin' shows like Lollapalooza on the road
Buildin' up momentum, whilst spittin' deadly venom
Takin' pictures for High Times, three months (?)
Chillin' with the Beastie Boys, smokin' lots of weed
But it was time to hit the studio for another LP
'93 (*echoes*) Black Sunday hits, with critical acclaim
Had a monster hit from Insane In The Brain
Topped the charts, held the spot, for six weeks to boot
It was a trip to note, that we was the first ones to do it
In rap music, but it was a feat none the less
So we started gettin' paid and I stopped smokin' STRESS!
(B-Real)
'94 (*echoes*) still in the door and we conquered many tours
With Rage Against The Machine, House Of Pain and many more
Was even invited to Woodstock, some niggas from the block
Called up Eric Bobo and half a million rocked
How could all this happen at 24 years of age?
Half a million bouncin' to your shit from off the stage
'95 (*echoes*) I was alive and survived so far (*""(Rap) Superstar""
Xylophone*)
Still tryin' to cope with bein' a Rap Star
'Cause that's the type of shit that can really affect your mental
This was evident, in the way I broke the tempo
With confusin,(""I'm havin' Illusions"") pain, and (?) illusions
But I still kept my set up with the critics bein' abusive (yeah)
Even the record company, they became illusive
When it comes to showin' support for the Cypress institution
'96 (*echoes*) wit' no support we were still makin' moves
Cypress Hill, in the summer, we were on the Smokin' Grooves
But like every legend every click, someone had to split
So the Dog left the house, shit was gettin' kinda thick
I was with the electric lady, we was talkin' about babies
But the groupies on the road don't help me from misbehavin'
Chorus (Just 1 repeat)
(B-Real)
'97 (*echoes*) was the trip, it was the year we killed the feud
Between us and Cube, over shit nobody knew
The Dog came back home (*barking*) but after Smokin' Grooves 2
Chillin' with George Clinton and Erykah Badu
This was a crazy time, we were flowin' off the boo
Niggas on stage, trippin' on the 'shrooms
'98 (*echoes*) was kinda great, 'cause it felt just like before
We hit the studio, recorded Cypress Hill IV
But someone dropped the ball, as I still recall
'Cause it felt Cypress Hill got no support at all
We did the last Smokin' Grooves, but did it all with Sen
And the old chemistry, just reared it's head again
'99 (*echoes*) I got to recline, because there was no doubt
That the first year was a success, of the Smoke Out
'99 was even better than the year of '98
And Skull And Bones was comin' out, kickin' from the gate
TWO-thousand! (*echoes*) 15 million records sold
They broke the mould, but there's others along the road
But we still keep rollin' on from Heaven to Atlantis
Droppin' shit in English and makin' albums in Spanish
Two-thousand and one! (*Echoes*) Goddamn, who knows what's in store?
Just as long as motherfuckers know, who's knockin' on the door
We remain unjaded and still we go unfaded
See how long we made it and never ben outdated
(B-Real) (Sen Dog)
We ain't goin' out, motherfucker (That's right, FUCK that!)
You don't know (?) ((?) time Cypress Hill)
(Motherfuckin' renovaters up here)

Invented and lend out, without not a tech
You're on the top of the game
But you work on a name till one day
To put us in the walk of fame
Don't call a name to recall the fame
Eventually Dru is in the Hall of Fame

You know who the Real is,
You know what my skill is,

I test myself, just to shut up and prove
That the C-Y-P-R-E-S-S
Got you funky, while I'm real deaf
Put it to the test, and you will confess
Soul Assassins is the best
Check it homeboy, got to spot cracking (crackin')
Six LP, from that Thugged-out Latin
Turn the heat up, and keep it hot
Always give ya mo', and then thank
We got to freak the Hip Hop and the hot ride

91,Last Laugh,2004,Till Death Do Us Part (2004),,Cypress Hill,"(Verse One)
Reflections of my own life flash like a fire
Powder burns the memories life seems a bad dream
Fall for centuries physical and the mental
When I crashed through work
I was cursed but still I
Quit my curse found my hustle
Stack paper made it world wide
Feeling the dream, don't be a hater son
Think you the greater one
Gotta put you on the fader son
Cut your ass up see you later
Gotta drop till your praying nigga
You ain't a player hust a frail nigga
I'm the slayer in your nightmares
Unstoppable
When you see me on the street
Call a audible
I got you covered, face it
And you can't dodge this bullet baby
This ain't the matrix
Got to put you in your placement
Hide your body in the basement
Your boys wonder where your face went
Homey we keet those on us
Smoke like mufflers
To calm down/I sell
But still explode
Those things so fast/they know not to gas they self
They can't fuck with us, we laugh last
(Verse Two)
Backbreakers of the game
Many many musical
Legendary criminal destined to be professional
I rain supreme
Ever since my days you rock vest just to push your range
No doubt about it
We grew up in the cloud
Read up in your magazine just to see what were about
Peep into the case, see me, ask
Why that black ass nigga flow over the piano
Droppin' it good
For that hoody in the front row
That's my good pro down for the juggalo
Three guns busted for the battle man
Shoot the whole scene make the motherfucker rattle
Duece, double o, slow
Church folk say we ain't got too many more
Either man rush I'm gonna hit 'em with the head rush
So be careful on what you trusting
Homey we keet those on us
Smoke like mufflers
To calm down/I sell
But still explode
Those things so fast/they know not to gas they self
They can't fuck with us, we laugh last
(Verse Three)
Yo
I was walking on the block
Heard a couple shots
Caught one in the leg
And I know who did it
They gonna get it
Wrap up my leg
Bounced upstairs and got strapped up
I love that drama shit
I'm all gassed up
I lit that kush up and got doughed up
And thought about all the foul shit I did
I can't help it, I was this way since a kid
Then I slide out the crib
Hunt down my pray
The look in my eyes like I sniffed some yay
Ran up on homes
And blast away
He passed away twin got the last laugh today
Anybody front I keep that on me
You had to die homey that's part of the game
I got guns put niggaz don't know how to aim
I'm in the shooting range mastering the art
Homey we keet those on us
Smoke like mufflers
To calm down/I sell
But still explode
Those things so fast/they know not to gas they self
They can't fuck with us, we laugh last"

Buckin' all these niggas till they all gone
Now we can roll to the east side of town
And I'm lookin' for a fat boy and a lotta (state of clown)

Pointed at your ass for the 1-8-7

Move back! Yo, B-Real..""

Now what if I moved it up right between your eyes
Now your chances are never
When you're lookin' at the slug at the of the barrel
Where ya gonna run when ya can't move further
Seven eighty one redruM with the Murder
Tie him up
Throw him in the trunk

Blow his earsdrums out

You say I'm the joint, but you can call me hooda
Computer, wizard, the butcher of scissors
Cut me up and spark and roll me up, like a blizzard
Dwellin your cells up, lungs start to swell up
Your pipe's gettin crowded, yo just forget about it
Me, is potent, so bring an opponent
You could suck on it, shit I know you wanted to
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
B-Real, light another
I'm smoked out, not on a menthol cigarette
How could you figure, or even, consider that
I'm, a weak seed, no, I'm the humble weed
Now feed it to me, hash spliff this tweed
Actin type of stylin, how do you spell it
Take a hit from outta New York into Phillie
Hit some Visine, so the smoke can let out
Now do you really think you can take the red out and
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
B-Real, light another
Spliff, aiyya, get off, vaya
Why ya, want ta, turn off the fire
You can't get higher, when you turn me off and
.. aiyyo, pussy stop coughin
You're wastin the lingo, soon all the sack's gone
He'll take this bounty rhyme for you to stack on
Anyway you have it, you love me like Mary Jane
Or a 40 to the head, like my brother Kenny Wayne
You need to inhale, musical paraphen'
Yes musical, Muggs fixed the trend
Ahhh, just like a head
Brain cells get lit, but I'm the joint you can't grip
Through, your finger, I'll start to sting ya
So just hear my words linger and
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo Muggs, light another!
Put me in the bamboo with just a tape deck
? like brother, rewinds the cassette
Was it, because it's funky that ya loves it?
 Here's another lyric, go puff it
Don't choke off the hype or croak off
When you blow the smoke off, hold until I get off
or turn off the fat joint, wanna hit that joint
Here is the flat point, I rob it at gun point
I'm the High Times, you get through my rhymes
Suck on the pipeline, sit back and recline
You gotta suck on, the fattie so come on and
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
I'll just, light another
Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
Yo, light another

I'm on the block straight, smokin' up a Ozone
You in my shit, steady beggin for my homegrown
The beat is on, the heat is on

Ain't takin' nobody back wit' me
It's on to the end anybody who wanna hit me
Ain't lookin' back puttin' it all on the line
Don't give a fuck bring the ruck one time
And now I think we should all get
Down and busy, pay it forward
Leave it spinning till you're dizzy
Niggas say who is he?
But I know for a fact
Same fool that's watchin'
Is the one who'll stab your back
So make a plot patrol nonstop
Know exactly who comes on the block
Take no prisoners put that in effect
Get the name from your set
And Tat it on your neck
Let these motherfuckers know who got next
South side Cypress Hill
Out here catchin' wreck
And show your respect
When you step up to me son
Don't imitate cause my style ain't in season
Go back to the lab up grade to chump
Get a new funk on before you get dumped on
Clear The Way Fool
Here I come With That Suicide Dawn
Melt down, takin' you home the unknown
Count down, hittin' the ground the seeds grown
Downtown, creepin' through alleys the dark night gets lit up
When lightning strikes get up.
2nd verse
Take a ride, when lightning strikes
City lights are gleamin' no sunshine,
No California dreamin'
The demon is roamin' on the loose
Who got juice suffer abuse
When electric currents are induced
Soul shocker lockin' on rock on the brain waves
What you clockin' on I'm droppin' a bomb you get maimed
The games you play look up and say you wanna change
And rearrange its strange you never go that way
Don't look back, forget that
You need that, just sit back
Look at the show and see that
Display the raw power, black out
Even the score, open the door and break out
Leap in alone to unknown fury, blind rage
Move aside, get fried and make the front page
Center stage you ask the task to leave quick
Or suffer the pain leavin' no hope to be fixed
Your heart beat pumpin your blood high pressure
Look at you stuck in the mud
Bring in the stretcher
Strapped down ready to roll to God knows
Tears coming down of buckets of rain slow
Melt down, takin' you home the unknown
Count down, hittin the ground, the seeds grown
Downtown, creepin' through alleys, the dark night gets lit up
When lightning strikes get up"

Para ése que se hace, pero nunca gana
Tira ese jamón en la pala
Y gana como rana, rana, estoy en la pista
Me siento como el hijo que conquista
No me hagas romperte fuerte
La silla me tiene como General Electric
Y las luces brillando, estoy pensando
No es lo mismo cuando estoy tomando
Ohh! mi mente despacio (despacio)
Por eso yo no trago del 4.0
Brother dame la hierba
Porque un negro como yo ta perdiendo la cabeza...
Chorus x4:
Medio loco en el coco...
(Ido de la mente!)
(Sen Dog)
Hago lo mío por abajo, ahora en el tubo
Para el voto, ponerse hasta más gordo
Gordinflón en la dieta no te metas
Te robo a ti como ladrón en la revuelta
Lo mío tiene fuerza, te tiro en la tierra
Con tu cara en el piso y tu cuerpo todo tuerca
Duros, tienes algunos, pero, no a mí, yo soy número uno
Pateo el estilo, de espiral del río
Pero cara de payaso, nunca me río
Con mi seria cara, te lo digo todo
Un negro como yo se está volviendo loco...
Chorus
(B-Real)
Como Louis tengo fuerza, toca trompeta
Le pego a la pipa y aplasto tu cabeza
Rápido, dame a mí mi lotería
Policía, quiere coger lo que crecía
Los puercos quieren soplar mi casa
Pero estoy por abajo con mi grasa
Pah se ponen bravos porque no estoy ahí
Estoy en mi Cadillac, hace tiempo que me fui
Soy el pirata, piloto del bote
Cuando estoy alto como un papalote
Corre de la luz de la chota
Cree en lo que no ves, cree en la lota
Mira, pero no te vuelvas loco
Un negro como yo, ya perdió su coco...

Where you never know if you'll be making it home today.
So many different attitudes that I come across
I'm hardened and scarred tonight, ain't feeling nobody's loss
Hustlers, hookers, killers, and thieves out on the street
Got my mind warped just found another corpse on the beat
Bound, gagged, raped I'm frustrated I hate it
Found a woman in the dumpster body was mutilated
Bad dreams all up in my head no lie
Sometimes I got to take a sniff so I could get by
Why don't I get help to settle my nerves I got the urge
To merge this bullet in my brain relieve my pain
What a fuckin' shame I don't wanna live, I'll paint the wall

I've been on the force over twenty years. I can say
That I'm worse than some of these motherfuckers I put away.
I'm in the biggest gang you ever saw, above the law.

Drug abusers, drug dealers and the gangbangin'
Pieces of shit who should be on the fuckin' noose hanging.
These days you can't tell who's who in the world
Is that a whore or is that an innocent young girl.
Fuck I need a drink and I'm almost stoned
At the precinct it's like an AA meeting all gone wrong.
I.A. got an eye on my close friend, Guy,
For takin' a supply from evidence from a bust on a buy
That doesn't concern me. We never rat on each other
We went through the academy just like frat brothers
It's midnight I only have an hour left on my shift
I think I'll get my dick sucked by this spacehead bitch
My marriage is all fucked. My wife lives with the neighbors.
Subpoenaed, now I gotta sign these fuckin' divorce papers.
I recall happier times before the fall.
Looking through the eye of the pig, I see it all.

No longer can I determine who's the criminal
From the innocent man down to the pedophile.
No one give a fuck about me. I'm slippin' into darkness
I'm coming to grips and feelin' heartless.
What's this? A dark green truck, tinted windows
Duly modified. Probably a drug dealer inside.
Pull over to the curb. Take your keys out of the ignition.
Raise your hands out the windows in the get 'em high position.
Don't move or I'm gonna blast your fuckin' head off.
Just tell me where the guns and dope are and you'll get off.
Don't give me that bullshit! I've heard about your raps.
All you're talking about is slangin' and shootin' off your straps.
Okay, Mr. B Real, get the fuck out of the truck.

(B-Real)
Now when people are done, bumpin they head to this
You wonder why you wanted anything instead of this
We been makin' you bounce, for many years already
Rock steady and cut, many niggaz to confetti
But I just want to blaze it up; whether it's the mic or a spliff
Yes my gift is to amaze you all
Thought I couldn't come for ten my friend, but guess what?
I slay niggaz and still savin' my best nut (low-ri-der)
But you better cover your eyes, cause you never know when
I spit it out and start some flowin
I drop rhymes that grow like trees you're smokin'
Ear drums feel like lungs, your brain's chokin
Just let it soak in, seep in, creep in
I'm keepin', all you motherfuckers in the deep end (low-ri-der)
You wanna trip? Then I got luggage
I stuff you in and send you off, cause you ain't rugged
(Chorus + (Mellow Man Ace))
Aww, comin' through fo' real we Cypress Hill, oh baby
Got that junk, for yo' trunk, goin' gangsta crazy
We some real life hustlers, playin' games in the street (low-ri-der)
We got that low-ri-der, scrapin dippin on three
So pop yo' collar, give a holla, throw the dubs in the air (low-ri-der)
We tear the roof, off the mother, lady let down yo' hair
Playa do that thang, that make you feel all right (low-ri-der)
Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin' freaky tonight
(B-Real and Sen Dog)
Cause, we're Cypress Hill, come on and ride with us
Just get inside, we bouncin' dippin, chop it up real tough
Lean to the side, pimp yo' hat, tilt yo' seat on back
Don't front on me, baby boy, and break bread with the sack (low-ri-der)
(Sen Dog)
I be the vato with the fine hoodrat in the ranfla
Always roll deep on the streets like the mafia
Pleito, just might come back and haunt ya
Flossin too much, no vato's gonna want ya
Not right here homes, we're past all of that
Makin' that feria, spittin' that raps
Ya me conoces, I'm down for my calle
Cypress Ave, y a pudo les madre (low-ri-der)
Ya tu sabes, we don't play that shit
Any pendejo's gettin' hit up quick
Whassup ese? What hood you claim?
Now throw it up and down like it ain't no thang (low-ri-der)
Hands in the air with the pinky rings
Soul Assassins, runnin' everything
To all you vatos, make sure you check this
In every barrio, I'm well respected (low-ri-der)

Low-ri-der... low-ri-der..."
109,Make A Move,1995,Cypress Hill III (Temple Of Boom) (1995),,Cypress Hill,"Ezekial 25:17
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of
The selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of
Charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And
I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger, those
Who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.
And you will know my name is the lord,
When I lay my vengeance upon thee!
(Shots fired)
Smokin' MC's like a bowl of Buddha
Burnin' in my bong NOW
You don't want to step to the rhythm of the funk degrees
You'll be a prisoner in the temple of thieves
Move it out, just move it on out, no doubt
We the number one crew
Kickin' more gas niggas out the house
Puttin' up an argument, just don't bother
'Cause I'll whoop that ass just like I'm your father
Take heed to the master's call yes y'all
(Bring your cell-phone 'cause I fade them all)
Bullets fly
But they don't give a fuck about who dies
When you're in the middle of the fuckin'
No question, confrontation
Nowhere to run from the assassination
Let the rain come down
Whoops there goes another body on the ground
Watch out for G hound
It's the undisputed Cypress family
Kickin' up dust can you handle us fragilly
Growin' inside your mind like a tumour
Spreading in your head like a rumor
Venomous!
I'm from the underground, I take care of business
What the fuck is this?
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Suckas come in all shapes sizes and colors
Let me get the rope
And hang 'em till their fuckin' necks broke
Wind passage cut off, now you can't breathe
Let me give you what you need
A fat dose of the good weed
Like a puppet on a string
I'm the one controlling your ass
With the rough shit here to bring
My army grows like the buddha I sold ya
Every seed planted is another fuckin' soldier
Like the 'coup d'etate'
Now ya are in the middle of the ambush
Stuck in your car
They can't find ya
At the bottom of the lake
Let me remind ya
You better be lookin' behind ya
It's too late, ain't no one standin' here
Hallucination, bees hummin' in your ear
Paranoia, dwelling to your dome piece
Increase, the level of the terror that move ceased
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Make a move, make a move, every posse make a move
Make a move, make a move, every posse make a move
Make a move, make a move, every posse make a move
Make a move, make a move, every posse make a move
Come on
Open up the doors for the high funk buddha
With the light point the dick can die
Rolling with the six shooter
Thirty-eight
Still shootin' real straight
Lookin' for the buster that I must eliminate
No surprise
As the inches demise
Let the four flow
As I look him right in the eyes
And rip these niggas in half
With the (fabergraph)
They can't find a path
I like the aftermath
Still I reign the sect we remain
The big bad Cypress Hill, fuckin' niggas up again
When I aim I'm scopin' for your brain
Brother stay low, cross-hairs break you up the frame
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!

Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Move 'em out! Move 'em on out! Move 'em out!
Ah, now that the mind is open so one can clearly see what they clearly
Don't want you to see. But it's obvious, isn't it my brother? Get the
Smoke from in the front of your eyes, got to realize, anybody don't like it:

111,Memories,2001,Stoned Raiders (2001),,Cypress Hill,"As I sit in my silver stack thinking about way back
Even before I started blazing the chronic sack
I was a go wild unfocused troublesome kid
Looking up to all the gangsters and the shit they did
I was at unimpressionable age through a faze
An unmentionable stage deranged full of rage
Walking through life in a haze with dark clouds
Hanging over my head being wicked and loud
And sometimes those demons haunt me and taunt me
Follow me pursue me confuse me they want me
They come at me from all angles and dangles
Memories in front of me, but I won't run away
I put the gun away but sometimes my hand ditches
But I don't want to get locked away 'cause I whack bitches
I left those ways back in the old days
So go away I don't got no time to throw away
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)
I got my education on the streets
And I learned how to spit rhymes out with or without beats
To say whatever I went through or going through
Tripping off people who acting like they been knowin' you
Learn how some of these record companies be holdin' you
Attaching an image in the end controllin you
But we set out to set ourselves apart
And let these people know just what they had from the start
It's like Ghostface said we studied our art form
We turned the mike on and spit a fucking dark storm
People slept on me and doubted my skill level
But I'm tenacious and I got a strong will level
You been introduced to some of the real rebels
Injected with venom from god to kill devils
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive)
I remember my days as youth
Teenage gangsters with somethin' to prove
See man amuse and we creep and we strew
Catch your ass slipping and dump on their crew
Just -- having fun but you crazy kids
Never thought about no prison beds
Got gang-sters twenty-five and alive
Never see the kids all fucking wild
But that's the game and shit don't change
Get respect for smoking brains
You get a name and you build your rep
You courting fools coming in your set
Before you know we're having fun
Slamming doping and packing gun
Leaving mad traces and blasting their faces
Got a hundred years for all my fucking cases
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out here so I can survive)
Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me
To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive)

Juras que soy el mejor
Tu quedaras igual que los demas
Esta alegandome, no lo trates
Porque te pego asi como tus padres
Has lo que te digo yo, si no

Balas, ayy! no les importa quien muera
Cuando estan en guerra
Con que maten, un vato del otro lado
Diferentes rumbos, cargan soldados
Si la lluvia cae, pronto miraras
Los huetos que hay (mueve tus cañones)

Calla y si no cruces claro que vas a morir

De navajas, balas que cargas

Atrapado por mi clicka en el auto

En lagos entierran evidencia y cae la miseria
Muy tarde llegan a buscarte a ti
Si me preguntan digo que yo no te vi

And bull shitters
Never had a quitter come with us
Who had the jitters sine some bitter tasting minute
I spit it for those who did it
Like a soldier so committed to winning
You never know who you running with nigga
Who you gunning with, who you thugging with
In times of struggle shit
Never be blinded by diamonds they signin for weak nigga
No sign of loyalty in anything you speak
You never know
You're breakable, celebrated but fadeable
You're biodegradeable
You just might die tonight
Get out of my sight cause
You ain't even know there's your fight

I just might die tonight so let's get hight tonight
Might try to fight, some mothers cry tonight
Cig in my right hand cause you hold tight to life
But you ain't a bright man

Hearing insane rambles saying that lifes a gamble
Praying for just a sample in amble times
To trample, example

Every thug nigga living his life
Giving his life meaning
Haters in the wings, they feeling their pride stinging
We here, death knocking its schocking
We keep it popping homey
We never stopping we keeping all you bitches dropping homey

I'm gonna see to him

He tried to warn us niggaz about ya

Took a look at the Real one: afro gone
The next morning, you didn't have yours on
How many ways will you bite my shit?
Would ya wet me or start throwing up a set?
Caution, when you enter the zone
Never used to bang till you hit the microphone (Studio gangsta!)

Pulling up his card and fucking up his ""good day""

""Once again!""
(B-Real) Once again it's Cypress Hill
""Back again!""
""Once again!""
(B-Real) Once again it's Cypress Hill
""I bring to YOU""
(Verse One: B-Real)
Welcome everyone, take ya places
It's great seein all these familiar faces
You want thug shit? We got a lot of it
You wanna get high? I'm on top of it
You want bottles? C'mon, we poppin' it
You want a revolution? Ain't no stoppin' it
Enemies try to fire back
Desire that, find you where the tire track
'Cause we run ya down son, but in spite of that
Got a joint? Fools give me my lighter back
... I'ma light up the bomb
I'ma blaze till we set off the fire alarm
No need for evacuation
Find a honey that's ill for ejaculation
She got friends, well the more the merrier
No limits, no worries, no more barriers
(Chorus 2X: B-Real, mixed with samples)
Once again it's Cypress Hill
We some ill-ass niggaz straight bumpin the field
Smoke it up, from now until
Somebody calls out steel and we live for the thrill
(Verse Two: B-Real)
Plug the mic in, and I'll move the crowd
Neighbors get mad cause the music's loud
I send a few girls in the hall to talk
Crusty old man never called the cops
No pistols, if you get my drift yo
You pull one and miss better slit yo' wrists bro
This ain't a gangsta party
But if you turn it into one a bullet might pierce yo' body
Relax, there's a lot of girls in here
You shitfaced niggaz, don't earl in here
Don't break shit or take nothin', mind your manners
Or your head goes BOOM like it's fuckin' skanless
But we ain't for all that right now, just chill out
We can pop bottles or let the blood spill out
Cuanta, suck it up, shut your trap
Before you lose that fine-ass girl on your lap
(Verse Three: B-Real)
You wanna room? Let me clear one out
But while I'm gone, just don't let the beers run out
In the morn' we can watch all the tears come out
When the pigs come, a nigga wanna hear one out
For now, we can pass the time
Blazin' it up, if you slow you the last in line
Got a roach, so what? You ain't spent a dime
You ungrateful-ass critter, back the hell of mine
You can, lose the life or lose the knife
Use the pipe, but I can't lose tonight
All the girls bein picky who they chose tonight
You better hope you chillin' with the right crew tonight
See that girl over there? Yeah she like your style
Probably seen her on the video ""Girls Gone Wild""
Hesitation is constipation
Of your game when you're in for a night of elation"
119,One Last Cigarette,2004,Till Death Do Us Part (2004),,Cypress Hill,"(Fuck you motherfucker! Untie me from this chair man
You better untie me from this chair nigga
You know who the fuck I am, I will have you killed nigga!
You better untie me motherfucker, fuck y'all motherfuckers man!
Do you know who the fuck I am?)
{*Beat drowns out the voice as a Cypress Hill member speaks*}
Right {*duct tape being unrolled*}
Sho' you right
You want a cigarette nigga?
(B-Real)
You was a good kid, your parents musta loved you
They got you out of trouble no matter how big the bubble
They gave you everything, nah you never needed nothin'
We used to get high, 'member we was weeded cousin
We used to go to clubs, blaze it up and act crazy
What made you turn around, was it drugs or your lady?
We had good times, committin hood crimes
We drew lines but you never understood mine
You don't go fuckin' homies, just like my momma told me
I held my hood up boldly, you were a fuckin' phony
I guess it manifested when I got the call early
They said you bunkered down in the hood with ol' girly
She had your back covered, but that didn't matter did it?
I know you're livin', but you put your fuckin' self in it
Don't try to make a move, nigga don't go fuckin' 'dere
I know you're hurtin' 'cause you're tied up to the fuckin' chair
You never loved your family, you robbed that mall gladly
They tried to love you sadly, you let 'em down badly
Just call me Death's angel, but we were never strangers
You 'bout to get mangled, that's truer than Kurt Angle
Now it's time to pay, any last words to say?
I know your mind strays, son I think you need to pray
Don't even need to tell you, you were a smart nigga
Save your teardrops, yo don't even start nigga
You shoulda thought of that long ago before you fucked me
You dodged me long enough, homey now you been lucky
But now it's pay the piper, no fuckin' traps or snipers
Just the gas and lighter, caught up in the web of spiders
But now you get devoured, burnin in the flames you coward
This is the very hour, I send your family flowers
I'm sure they all will miss you, but they will be good without you
They'll reminisce and light a candle as they talk about you
(Cypress Hill)
Relax... no no it's okay
Let me give you a light {*muffled: ""Oh SHIT!""*}
{*Flames roaring, a voice screaming*}
That's my favorite fucking song...
{*In the background, ""Pigs"" by Cypress Hill plays*}

With the kush weed that would hurt you
If you got the purple we can blaze it

You shoulda bought
Then you know the rules
Before you hit it once
When you catch my blunt
You know which way to pass it
When it comes
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Don't ever pass it on the right
Never ash it on my Nike
If you sprinkle hash in it
Just don't let it out your sight
'Cause if you take it outta sight,
Well ya just beggin' for a fight
Aight!
Give me a lighter,
So why you can't decide
To ignite it?
Puff Puff Pass homie!
Don't just stand and try to hide it
I smoke a bowl or a spliff
And uplift my sprits
Then I take a bong hit
Hit it fuckin' hard
And clear it
Hit it with the left hand,
Pass to the next man
Still the fool is blessed,
And his weed is from the west
And you'll never get it done
Your bitin',
You can bet it on your life

I'm Green Evidence
On the podium, stands the minister
I see weed from Cypress trees
I just finished up
I'm center stage high,
Civic center stage dive
Even summer, winter, spring,
And fall, ain't the same
My heads in the clouds
Of smoke then I choke and laugh,
Then toke on the left hand side
No joke work
Can touch these Los Angeles souls
We twist herbs up
The word's a dangerous flow
(Go!)
(Only on the left hand...)
When I smoke
I'm tilted to the side like a kick stand
Roll up a rock
And call me a middle man
I'm sinkin' a riddle
Like it was quicksand
One *snort* clear out your nasal passage
Wit the medicine of dristan
Voilà
My mind at ease...
The Police car (Whoop-Whoop)
Wanna come find my trees
Hashish from Iraq
Will make my eyes Chinese
Tearing up the studio
Just tryin' to find my keys (la, la, la, la, la...)
It's like that y'all
Pass the joint on the left hand side
Only on the left hand side
Pass the joint on the left hand side

Geeyeah, Soul Assassins two times, stick em!
Geeyeah, Cypress Hill three times, come on!
Geeyeah...
Infiltration be our daily operation for chasin
Cross the seven seas eased, clockin much conversation
Penetration, you know we gets busy, no hesitation
Greenery, hand-picked, from my own plantation
Feels the heat, under the som-brero
To any amigo that's tryin' to, stop the dineros
Chills with, senoritas, like charro
Get drunk off tequila lay low till tomorrow
Follow, my flow, get the cash and go
Call my homey B-Rizzy in Mexico City
Loose lips sink ships, faker faces got guilt
Didn't mean to call you late, I need a hideout till...
Cool, homey, I'll bring some fuckin' skunk
The homey smuggle me across lines in a trunk
Just like a bird I'm free, in a land
With no fuckin' extradition treaty, I'm out, geyeah
""Shit is real on the motherfuckin Hill God"" (2X)
""With the crew from off the Hill""
(B-Real)
B-Really killin' the Phillie now can you feel me from the
Soul Assassin committee, the shitty niggaz never thrill me
You silly bitches never respect, neglect money
You funny or broke, think it's a joke, your nose is runny
Got my main man, Mr. Rocho kickin the vocals
From the Eastside, where it's loco sellin the poco
From the two G's, breakin the leaves of cheese, makin' the bacon
You hear it sizzle got your hands ready for the takin'
Evading the pigs, raiding my crib, I'm mad lib
And I wanna live and I'm givin' the message droppin' the lesson
Flippin shit, and I'm keepin' 'em guessin they all stressin
Hit the lullaby, no confession, we in session

We's beez the three amigos, skates with nickel plates
Under the seat and we goes East Coast/West Coast, anybody killer!
Soul Assassins gets the cash and smash *vroom*
Who spits the Glocks like uno and dos?
Makin' your body disappear like a ghost
One time's tryin' to gaffle me, harassin me
Tryin' to send me to the penetentiary

In the nighttime, niggaz are creepin' you fuckin' sleepin'
And the beat, just keeps on seepin into the street
While you peakin I'm meetin and greetin the people speakin'
And leadin the motherfuckers who's seekin' to catch, ruckus
Meaning you suckers no-luckers overdub us, nut hug us

(B-Real)
I'll admit, I was a wild seed when I was a kid
Slangin dope, poppin' Shroomz and droppin' lots of sin
Psychodelic visions would ensue
My view feelin' the alter-states as they altered my fate
But I ??? ???, all that distorted shit brought it up
I came short and couldn't afford to store it up
So I began to record it on audio
The autobiography of Luis Mario
Something that's unbelievable, inconceivable
That half the shit I set out to do was achievable
But alas, look at all the shit come to pass
While we remained strong, others broke like glass
'Cause you lack style, and you need all the help brother
'Cause you're fragile, and it should say it on your cover:
This side up, for the celebrity
Who lacks intelligence, integrity, intensity
Oh it's true, I got you in that angle like Kurt
But don't go gettin' your fuckin' feelings hurt
I spit many bars of heat, that burn like a furnace,
I pour rhymes out like coffee spillin out your 'dermis
(Lalalala-lala-lalala)
I got my 9mm at my waist, papa
I got my shotgun in the escalade, papa
If you feel groggy then jump and get sprayed, papa
I don't wanna but you dug your own grave, papa
(B-Real)
You know me and you've grown with me
And if I had a big enough pad, I'd take you all home with me
I don't walk around with bodyguards, that's not me
I'm hangin' out with the people as my posse
Used to have a lot of enemies with bad intentions
Spreading gossip like disease, creating lots of tension
People turn around when you become a star it seems
But others hate you all 'cause you've fulfilled all your dreams
They smile in your face and act like nothing's wrong
When you turn your back, they hate, and play one of your
Songs
Why don't you take your mask off, look me in the eye?
You afraid I might blast-off and call you on your life?
Take a deep one, and peep son
Retribution comes around more than once, like a re-run
You're a cheap one to kill, so steep son
You're just another one who gets thrown in the quay, son
(B-Real)
You know they smile in your face,
You know they try to take space
I let you punks know you ain't safe
'Cause you know you're just dead-weight
But at the present day they gettin' stalled out for some
Reason
But not from me, because it's punk-hunt season
Charged with high-treason, I'm easin the blow never
The ????, that you're leasin, ain't gonna roll forever
So think about that, is it worth the pain?
When you flirt with pain, bitch you don't hurt your brain
But you're thick-headed, numbskull and Rick said it:
It was the moment you feared, when my venom spread
You know they smile in your face
You know they try to take space
I let you punks know you ain't safe
'Cause you know you're just dead-weight"

Y se cuando me ve no me aguanta
Por que los puercos no les gusta cuando dice

Haciendo dinero de las drogas
Pero a este puerquito lo cogieron
So cuando llegue al bote le van a partir su boca

Better pray to the sky and get ready
When you decide come on tell me
You got a choice in life with a fork in the road
Got your back turned with your eyes closed with a blindfold
When you open them up there's a signpost
Enter at your own risk better find out where your home is
Some chose the streets livin' a life outlawed
Doubt you'll see me spittin'my game southpole
Careful with the choices you make
You gotta live with them, can't you hear the voices you hate
How do you deal with them
Some took another path felt they own wrath add drugs to the math
Cut the life spans in half from deaths to cold sweats
To soul lets go into the abbys
We are gonna miss you yo
I put my fist up I ain't gonna hit you nigga
I got no regrets I ain't gonna diss you nigga
I just pray for you even though you're hard headed
You made your own bed and I hope you don't get wetted
I took the wrongsteps too but I learned from them
I drew heat from my niggaz like the burning sun
But like all lessons I need a self check I still got my strap
But now I use my brain as a weapon
Could have stood left chose death no bread underfed
All these niggaz spraying lead pushing on me laying dead
This ain't gonna happen yet bitches I'm a fucking vet

This is the Lower Eastside of things
YouknowhatI'msayin? Cypress Hill
You ain't flamboyant, a toy boy on it
Ain't paid a plot, for un-em-b-boyment
I won't cause yo I got a lot of what I gotcha
Plus I taught ya, the beat on the top of
Everything you know, still you can't do no
Damage or duel though aiyyo, 'cause our crew now
The Real is the beist, sport and you can see this
G-ness dialogue, of the real skiers
I ain't nuttin like a joke, get stoned, get smoked
and choke off, the hypes I cook off
The dialectic, funk-elistic
Chew slower or become another statistic
Ohh, now you can't see I'm real great?
Check out the story to the glory of the real estate
Yo I told you to keep down brother
The motherfuckers just don't learn nothin G
Wake up Hill
They gotta keep goin back to the old school
So they keep goin out
Cause they're just not Real
Ha yeah that's right fool
Yes the master pass, kick your ass
And feel combustion for the dope blast
'Cause you're steppin on my property, get off it G
Get caught up, then you get shot up
See, violators will be prosecuted
By the reputed, undisputed, Cypress zooted
Not so, no there's no sellout
You ain't got enough duckets to shell out
Well I'm in front, and yo I feel great
Check out the story to the glory of the real estate
Yeah, roaches come in but they don't come out G
Don't come on the Hill
That's right
Get off the Real Estate
Get off the Real Estate
Get off the Real Estate
Get off the Real Estate"
130,Red Light Visions,1995,Cypress Hill III (Temple Of Boom) (1995),,Cypress Hill,"Look at all these m.c's tryin' to get dap,
But all they get; a peeled back dome cap.
I'm not the one to be havin' that shit,
All the punk niggas better bow down and submit.
Niggas don't know how to keep it real.
Only a few niggas know the real deal.
Fuck all the bullshit, cypress hill!
Come's rainning on your brain, bringin' the blood stain.
Smeared on the side walk, one more dome.
Of the preditor skull hanging in my home.
The big game hunter, fuckin' up shit.
Get your ass back; while the hill's in the cut.
Fool get in the circle lets see if your raw?
Hardcore ass vato might hit the fuckin' floor.
Glock's, and sig's, and m-1 clips.
For any busters who wanna flip.
Fat s.a. ring shining in your eye.
Soul of an assassin till I die.
Red light visions in your dome piece,
Nightmares goin' through your head don't cease.
Look at you now broke down, and done.
No competition can ever get none."
131,"Red, Meth & B",2001,Stoned Raiders (2001),,Cypress Hill,"Y'all ready for this?
Ha! I don't think so!
Yeah! Oh, listen to this!
We gonna come at ya!
(Redman)
Cypress Hill!
All my niggas say jump up, doc broke out the kennel
A dog on four paws spittin' out the window
Jump up! It ain't no need to fight
We may squeeze too tight, you gonna bleed tonight
I eat beans and rice, shit up a storm
I walk the streets with sharp (?) off my arms
Doctor Dolittle, lit off the bone
My bracelet like I raised it off the bomb
Home-grown, thick, dirty
My family few dudes who pack tools on survey
Jersey and house
Gun like an elephants mouth
Pull ya ambulance out
Ya whole team'll get bombarded
Ya on target, and bombed by some unsigned artists
We leave ya hair cut like a blind barber
Cut it, and gave you a line with fine markers
I won't leave till the job is done
Till the last prick nigga take ya wallet, RUN
Doc with the shotty and we both catch a body with Cypress Hill
Yeah!
(Chorus: B-Real)
We don't give a fuck, we living up till the day we die
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high
You won't be real with us, but ya reelin' us and you want to ride
You try to deal with us, but you got no blunts to get high
(Method Man)
Yo, yo, yo
Blunt smokin', half a bottle of remi open
You either holdin' or half-assed like Shimmy Coaling
I leave ya chokin' on them lollipop rhymes ya callin'
So hard, hell I crack the shell on ya candy coatin'
If the shoes fit like Alan I did
(?) Yo my new chicks a new bitch
Ya know if I can't eat, ya can't sleep
Plus I'm in denial, I just can't admit defeat
My mind is my glock, keep my third eye cocked
Bust mines off tops, leave the rappers nerve shocked
Now who's hot and who's not
I want them rocks and that money in ya two socks
Meth the mister, if crime is an art, then let me paint a picture
I'm gone, Kodak can't even frame the riddler
Gold realin', Meth, doc, Cypress Hiller
Whoever think they fuckin' with that, lets be realer
(B-Real)
Take the back seat and smash beats
Smoke blunts through ya lungs and flex ya brain cells like athletes
When a track meets the rhymes on ya rap sheet
With a foot long (?) bong, look your collapsing, sicko
Thincho, on the brink of mental breakdown and shit you wouldn't think of
I spread it to Reggie, chances are better but deadly
You wanna be friendly on the get high Bentley
You twisted up, burnt out within seconds
'Cause you couldn't hang with the John Blaze methods
Bong hittin', doc spittin', shark bitten
Star stricken, clock clickin', stop shittin'
Inhale the smoke from the master's lungs
You wanna roll up, yo I'm the fastest one (ha!)
You wanna test with the sess, well first off
That shit is funny like Kid Rock with his shirt off"

So I'm gonna rise like smoke [x3]
T'ill the day they put me underground

I gotta break these chains
Take these reins
Ignore these pains
No pain no gain
I gotta hard move like like a muscle car
Get ahead of the pack
Get like a double R
I never loose sight
Only to too tight
Only to get away
Too many will lose sight
And right now you got your head in the clouds
Screaming your name
Nothing can bring you down
Everybody gotta dream
Hurry up and go get it
Singing the same song
You ain't in tune
Tellin' yourself I'mma get ine soon
It's a race to the limelight
And the pack is running
Can you keep up and tell us that you want it
When you get it tell us what you're gonna with it
Imma gonna show you how to move with it
Imma go hardcore what I believe in

Never rest gotta keep moving
Anything less put my shoe in it
What you want holmes?

Best believe it's the motherfuckin' box son
I feel hungry but that's the sex
Ain't done yet like broadway brick
Ain't no question that's why I'm a threat
I'm getto raised right out the projects
Now you know that I'll be done when I wanna go

When the lights go on and the mic turn on
Find someone it's so live it's wrong
You wanted more then your typical common hit
Feels good when the band bounces kinky shit
Right after the show after the flow
On the grounds in the back look out for out yo
Where the shorty at?
She wanna ride with the band
She screamin' ""Guys I'm your biggest fan""
Looking cute, whaetever she can
She looking cute like a bride in day
Sweatin' hard she won't resist
When you ask her she plays just like this:

135,Rise Up,2010,Rise Up (2010),,Cypress Hill,"Living in the big city
The American dream
Is far roaming in the streets of greed
Everywhere I turn I'm on a mission for more
But I ain't selling my soul
With the dope there's no girl
I'm on a one way box to the top
Hitting the strip but got a sound that would rally the block
I'm in the fast lane and I won't stop
You ain't nothing but talk
You couldn't hang on the rope by ball
This life that I live
It ain't for the weak
Got my roddy gangster that came off the street
I'm trying to keep the peace
But I gotta keep my pace
Got these drunk police
Want me all rappy
And I'm searching for the higher ground
I want my head in the sky
So high that I can't come down
Leave your lies in every town across the nation
'Cause you can never stop to play
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)

How high can you get?
Cruising in the drop Chevy
Got my foot on the floor
I'm hitting switches and my brim is heavy
You wanna look inside
And see who's crossing the brine
Curiosity is killing you
With stick in the prime
I get high from the brim in the set
Never gripping the square
But all you haters couldn't hold my
Don't need a clip for my ? straight
You should leave it alone
And check your toe 'cause my line will spit
This right here's as high as it gets
Somebody likes it... the hell
'Cause you stepped on the sex
But guess who will show you, you gotta pass the check
Got my clock on deck and my custom vest streets
You came, for me I'm the best
And you can keep the dress
'Cause I'm smoke at the less
Turn a step back I'm tired of getting pushed
Gotta rise up to the top (to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
Gotta rise up to the top (to the top)
Can't stop (How high can you get?)
'Cause what goes up must come down
So we gotta rise up to the Higher ground
Rise Up (Rise Up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
Rise Up (Rise Up)
How high can you get?
I go psycho, crazy Michael Myers
Except the stages on fire going higher
'Cause when I lean on a flyer
There's so much more to make the whole city rise
This defines a man to get the whole world lifted
Wall man trying to make a land with a mission
There's no way you can stand in this position
You can't take the heat get the fuck about the tension
Go with the will to hustle, you see if we hit the floor
You'll never stop it you ain't got the muscle
Were going to world top, homeboy this is the show
We gotta blow up the stage be out the door
Sometimes we all nedd an escape
So when we form our track
Well get your mind while we get the stat
I made a pack with a crew on the hill
We continue to build with all the people who believe their bill

I got the sawed off shotgun
Hand on the pump
With the fucking red bastard
Snitching like a punk
I had the operation tight the flaws
Faded doors
There's no growin' room on the basement floor
I'm holding weight every 30 days
Business pays
So many ways
Many methods of moving my white haze
I got the cellophane, get this money tonight
I got the shipment goin' out
Got to be air tight
So when you fuck around
No time for me to fuck around
I got the ballin niggaz waitin on me
At the compound
So get the trucks ready, and let's hit the back roads
To scam this motherfuckin' ass border patrol
I got my cousin Huey paid
For lookin' away
Back on the 405 on the way to LA
*Talking*
I'm multiplying in my head
Just how much stash it's gonna take for me
To double and triple up all my cash
I hit the city limits, time for me to check myself
'Cause I don't wanna sit inside no fuckin' cell
Slope the rolls down, hold down, I see the gate
So I'm pulling up, and I hope these fools ain't late
Or I'm outta here, wait, no, I see them in the rear
With 3 or 4 fools holding 2's in the real
I got the double barrel shit, hidden under my coat
For any crazy eyed motherfucker rockin' the boat
I got the big boss hoss, just sippin the sauce
You got the shit? you got the money?
Then break the shit off
(Sang reggae style)
Check out the herb man smugglin'
Bright and early in the mornin'
This is for the herb man smugglin'
I know the DEA is waitin'
Take out the herb man smugglin'
It's my ass that I'm risking
This is for the herb man sumgglin'
I know it's your daily livin'
I came a long, long way from slangin the herb
Sometimes I think about when I was kickin it to the curb
Now it's dirt in my pocket
But shit done changed
Tatoos on my body and fat gold chains
Got the mega shipment that must go out
On the same route me and my cousins started out
Head back to Mexico for a friend of mine
We're gonna bring this shit load back, 4-0 pounds
It's like crack rock, 'cause we done this shit before
Now I loaded up the stash on the hollow floor
Double checkin' everything, now it all looks cool
Now we rollin' to the border like we used to do
We pulled up at the border, but something was wrong
I began to realize that the swoop was on
I had the DEA and immigration closin' in
They had dogs all around my shit, no way to win

With aggression, Smith and Wesson, in his possession
Harlem got me like that, too many grimy, slimy niggaz on the take
For short cake, we won't hesistate
I miss inhabitants who politic in residence for presidents
Across 110th, to 55th
My covenant is protected, I'm doministic
Survival principles my ethics, eastern philosophy's my method
Good samaritans need paremedics, so what's your premise

As I get raggamuffin, no bluffin, the body bagged
Breaks all your bad habits, bad blood fanatics
Clean up the magic, chrome startin up static
Greed means that you die quick, click the vision
Greed lies anmbition, five slugs for the mission
Seven cause you go to the heaven or hell and dwell
To meet your maker, but you met the shotgun shell
Buckshots sting like bees, I smoke trees
On the hilltops, clubshops and chilling overseas
Take in the breeze, Mr. Freeze squeeze the trigger
Killa G's got you week in the knees, to take it ea-sy!

Magnificent guns bust when 'Uzi Weighs a Ton'
And yo' Glock spits, consecutive rounds shot from clips
Spells murder, sound synonymous to burner
Leave niggaz ass up, gaspin for air, front seats of truck
So who the fuck want me to press on they luck, bastard they son
When gats start to hum and whole crowds begin to run
Annihilation, destroyin all expectations
Have relatives embrace your Harlem hopital, we all patient
5 foot 6, concealed steel, pop more grip
With fixed sights that drifted to right, triggers light
So relinquish son, I'm to the finish, and you acknowledge
Couldn't pop a clutch or light a skyrocket, nigga stop it!

And your chest beats, blowin' out your back, take it easy
To your eulogy, open heart surgery
Emergency, 911, come in a hurry
From the Hills to the Polo realms, stackin the bills
I put you under my lo-lo, hit my switch, then kill
A bitch nigga steppin on my toes, fuck foes and hoes
Get stuck in the ass like Pete Rose
I suppose you wanna get wild and throw blows, you chose
To get you nose your broke, in a thick cloud of smoke
You're like a fat joint, I'm takin' a toke, I'm like coke
But you ain't smilin', feelin' erratic, a fuckin' addict
To the dope shit, you better hope the shit stop

As a kid, I was known, son of a thug
Snub-nosed .38 in the glove, who can relate with us?
Never had an easy life, shit's way out
Clips spray out, fools pay out or play out
Any scenario, been there, done that
Gone where some of y'all niggaz, couldn't come back
Been through the hottest parts of hell
Came back with a hard shell and, hard as nails
I went through it all, do it all, screw it all
Small you recall, the hard times as a juve-nile
Often misunderstood
Some joined the military, others just joined the hood
Street corner combat, part of the dark streets
Your heart beats pump when my slugs release
And there ain't no tellin', don't be the one yellin'
These birds are deadly, they can shatter your melon
(Chorus 2X: B-Real)
When the street wars jump off, there's only one thing to do
Grab your gat and squeeze one off
This ain't the life of the soft ones who run off
You got one shot to get you a knot

At the crossroads, sick of holdin' the badlands
Where street wars, kick off quicker than Van Dam
Mistakes of mad man, I remember the old ways
The old days where fools clapped yo' {?}
No quarter, you feel me?
Life expectancy's just a little bit shorter
G's gave the order, you carried 'em out
Quick fast, you the last nigga I'm worried about
Get that street lead, that was one step over the edge
Much closer to death, every step I kept on
Learnin about the dark paths, made a hard left
Prayed to God death is swift and painless
This life ain't for everyone, stay out my shoes
You can't trade your fate, I hate to break the news
The young won't respect the fences these days
You a marked man if you get caught up in these ways
When the street wars jump off, there's only one thing to do
Grab your gat and squeeze one off
This ain't the life of the soft ones who run off
You got one shot to get you a knot

When the street wars jump off, there's only one thing to do
Grab your gat and squeeze one off

I'm contemplatin' how to hit 'em hard
Hit 'em fast
Get away it's all she wrote
It's a heartbreaking habit
When you gotta have it
You grab it
Stare at an album
So good at it
Certified
Good magic
Look at it
In your face
Money's gone
So am I so long
But now my hustle's changed
No more stickin' you up
I've got some weed I know that for sure it can lift you up
Just spark it up
I gotta dime or a twenty sack
All sales are final
Don't ask for your money back
Don't even look at the money sack
It's funny that
It still wasn't enough
I like still searchin' for honey flack
No I'm servin' the boulders
Looking over my shoulders
Every step that I take
A rock might knock me over
Strike the match
That sparks the flame
Start the fire that burns down the system
Hit 'em hard hit 'em fast
Keep the gas on em
We're gonna char
Get the dogs go gas on em

A brace to be a gangster
Grew up
Rock stages
A long way from
But I got gauges
Comin' out pullin guns out on strangers
Bunch a wild niggas
Nobody can tame us
Sixteen in the clip
One in the chamber
Drive by homicide
Shit I gotta roll a dime
Ever day I ran away
My life one helluva time
I like to see heads get busted
A problem
That's how I solve em
No discussion
Go for my mind
Task force rush em
Until that day
All I gotta say is fuck em
Strike the match
That sparks the flame
Start the fire that burns down the system
Hit 'em hard hit 'em fast
Keep the gas on em
We're gonna char
Get the dogs go gas on em
Post it on the top son
Claw some
Makin' my way
Through the jungle
Living with the life
Call something
Evolving with each hustle
The street sweep
To a heatseeker
With ambitions to be a ring leader
When you're in the top spot
You better be top notch
If not watch the haters take pot shots
Its none stop shit talkin'
Beat off the conflict
Ready to harm him
Disarm him
Send his ass away in a coffin
My game is silent you don't see it that often
But every passing day I see the time slipping away
Ticket on a train till an early grave
Reap what you sough
Never had a handout
Had my hustle's planned out
Worked to get the brand out
You wish my luck would run out
Strike the match
That sparks the flame
Start the fire that burns down the system
Hit 'em hard hit 'em fast
Keep the gas on em
We're gonna char
Get the dogs go gas on em"
150,Take My Pain,2010,Rise Up (2010),,Cypress Hill,"(Feat. Everlast)
I'm at a strange point of my life, my spirit ignites,
I'm destined for heights, I'm so solid with the quest of the life,
I'm under pressure but the time is right,
For me to look inside of myself, the time passes by every night,
I'm searching for answers meanwhile my faith does surprise,
And my neighbours are looking at me with hate in their eyes,
Quad and tea, the streets filled with death and lies,
Was set up to die but we plant seeds to rise,
So when day comes pray so a miracle will keep it protected,
Some of us gotta go but you know it you expect it,
I gotta believe, in more than I see, in something better than this, whatever it is,
I need a quate before my feeling is gone,
Maybe my feeling is wrong
But ill embrace it like a beautiful song,
I feel something strong coming along,
I can't explain what it is, but I'm relaxed till my mind is gone.
Day destroys the night,
Night divides the day,
Reaper's hold is tight,
Lord take my pain away.
This feeling is hitting me hard, my soul is scarred,
The feeling is saw like I'm getting a message from god,
Believin in cause, no one believes in the laws,
The reason the strong breaks - a soul is lost,
I'm searching for my soul in a myst of boldest insanity,
I'd vanity my home is a warzone callamity, randomly,
Tragedies happen I'm sick of this life,
I'd give in a minute the Vicapri is from stripe,
Gotta bond with the new brothers, leditucci and
Cheddars survival of our mothers would be proud of us,
When the day comes and we rise the high of our faith,
And nothing can touch us, we don't the feel the mothers,
Now the bees inside of my head, the life that I lead,
Left me for dead and lost on the path that I tread,
I blade so many to rest, from family to friends
We pretend it doesn't happen, but when will it end?
Day destroys the night,
Night divides the day,
Reaper's hold is tight,
Lord take my pain away.
I gotta new thought in my mind, in a matter of time,
I'll be in a sublime state of the spiritual kind,
My family is holding me high, they're nervous inside,
I can see in their eyes pride but the eyes don't lie,
If the celebration continues Ill follow my heart,
And my home is being infected from the poisonous dart.
Its fallin' apart, I don't wanna see its demise.
So imma have to make a difference to remember I tried,
My brother and sister smiling as I leave in the night,
My mother kisses me on the cheek and my father is quiet,
No words need to be said as my patters begun, cause
Nothing can break the chain of a father and son,
As I take a step in the street where my destiny lies,
Tryin' to focus, my nerves got my stomach in ties,
Rollin' in a club god damn these people are young,
But needs to be done so Ill reach you over the hoe.
Day destroys the night,
Night divides the day,
Reaper's hold is tight,
Lord take my pain away."

(S-D & B-R:) (grito mexicano)
(B-Real:) Cometelo joven...
(Sen Dog:) Cometelo jajaja!...
(Sen Dog)
Aqui estoy con mi barrio, listo a hacer feria
Cartel Cypress Hill esta en tu area
Colectando queso alla en Mexico
Donde el sol quema duro y baja despacio
Tengo mis camaradas y todo esta bien 
Tengo una mansion en tierra que mide cien
Y todos se den cuenta vengo a hacer tranzas
Con mucha libra aqui estoy pa La Raza
Me ven en mi ranfla con todos los Hierro
Cuidando mi negocio con todo mi perro
No trates nada tengo mis soldados
Espiritu asesino, vienen preparados
Raperos desperados es nuestra tema
El dicho de nosotros: Agarra la crema...!
(Chorus x2:)
Tequila Sunrise, con los ojos rojos
Un dia vamos a morir, escandaloso!
(B-Real) 
Nunca conoci dinero asi, en mis manos
Hasta que conoci un camarada como hermano
No importa donde miro tiene a todos asustados
Corriendo por cubre, con mas que vende 'marrados
Pero como un querieron me enseno la foto grande
Asi vendiendo drogas jamas, nunca andes
No como rateros que no entienden, no comprenden
No pases anos torcido con placas en tu frente
?Entiendes?
Me dio una copa y tome, el sabor malo del gusano
Mejame dandome lecciones
Me cacheteo y dijo: Mira, eres mi mejor paisa pero nunca me miras
Has lo que digo y te hago rico chico
Ratas duermen en hoyos, no me cruces o te pico
Que no se te olviden las reglas del juego
Te van a conocer hasta que quemes en el fuego
Mujeres falsas y dinero no va
Como tomando, manejando, mi hermano te mataran
Quedate alerto a lo que esta alrededor
Esas cosas que te dije van a ser tu matador
Tenlo todo en orden la plata no va a parar
Recuerdate de mi y siempre vas a ganar... 
(Chorus)
(B-real)
Tequila Sunrise, Ayayay
Tiempo vuela rapido, hijo y by surprise
Mi vana se murio y a mi me dejo
Capitan de las movidas aqui digo yo
Tragate el gusano cabron, soy el maton
Si no me matas te mato a ti como un ladron
Confia en nadie, vengo pa tras
Y jamas me cruces a mi porque yo tengo mas
Me recuerdo lo que dijo Jesus: 
'Si quieres el dinero, paisa, tienes que ser primero'
Que te peguen mis palabras, esta listo pa morir
A todo tiempo, porque si no vas a sufrir...

Verse One: B Smooth
Word up, Tequila style... eat the worm Motherfucker
(Overlapping intro's end)
Tequila spice, hot nice
Milling rice, sipping on Jose Cuervo
Down in Tiajuana, Mexico
Thinking of the big score the night before
Met the connect, who was impressively dressed
In high fabrics
With troops like Babe Ruth, up on the mezzanine
Brandishing sub-machine guns, aye-yo
It's all about the money, son
Now that's the only reason
We came south of the border, to complete this work order
We gotta get it, no looking back, going all out for it
Ready to attack, die in a minute flat for it
As God is my witness, we got ditches
For all you motherfuckin fake bitches
It all boils down to the business
Nothing personal, when niggaz acting like they helping you
I fuckin' blast you like Frank Castle, motherfucker!
Tequila Sunrise, bloodshot eyes
Realize we're all born to die
So get the money nigga!
Verse Two: B-Real
I never knew money like this, in the palm of my hand
Till I met the man with mad hook-up, and big plan
Every where you look'a, he got everybody shook up
Running for cover, the big bad WOOF, motherfucker
He was like a father figure, show me the bigger picture
Fuck slangin' on the corner, don't let the pigs get you
Not like these fools who don't comprehend
You end up doing a twenty-five bid in the pen
You got that? Getting your cup, I took a swig
The bitter taste of the 'mezcal', free worm shit
Droppin' a lesson, he slapped my face, he said listen
Pay attention brotha, you're my ace, but don't ever question
Just do what I say, and you'll be rich
And keep this in your mind: rats lay in a ditch with no spine
Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game
Cheers, they all know your name, it's like fame
Why, women and money don't mix, like drinking an' driving
Watch those conniving women and keep your eye out
Always be aware of what's around you
They wanna down you, and fuckin' clown you
Keep your shit in order the money won't stop
Pretty soon you'll be on top
Verse Three: B-Real
Tequila Sunrise, with the bloodshot eyes
My, my, my, how time flies and goes by surprise
My mentor passed on and passed a warn to me, emergency
For my enemies who wanna murder me
Eat the worm, motherfucker, while you burn, motherfucker
Better kill me, don't let me return, motherfucker
Trust no man, 'cause I'll be back, you understand?
With a plan, and my ace in hand, I want it all
I recall the words from Jesus, you are the Juice
Better go get it, don't let it get to your head, embed it
Let these words stick, you better be ready to die
Now take a fucking sip, caution it, but I never lie

Are you realizin, that, it's gettin better?
Surprisin' you, whether or not, your shit's together
from the high-pitched levels

Never in your life will you wet this
This crazy business, now you're thinkin'

The formula will run ya I'll start takin up a list
So you can get blitzed and you feel your head's twisted
Now insisted, you feel it to the brim
Yo I ain't him, I could never be them
This ain't poison, so let's go out on a limb
For the boys and girls who haven't had it yet
If you get too much, and roll it too straight
yo it's a fatal blow, somethin like a KO
Yeah it'll sting ya, (?)
See ya, I'm on it, somethin for the blunted
Just what you wanted, so you can feel the high

Cypress Hill has come, any quest/just ask them
Cause we are answerin, any brothers that've been
On the dick swingin, and straight gatherin'
Enter da info, 'cause yo what you're in fo'
Is a crazy day, strapped in a pimp mode
Trapped like a prophet, but I still profit
Even when you're off it, bank's in my pocket
'Cause of my music, what you call me chumpy?
In my trade, the Tribe is known to get funky
Hif is here to hack you sown, Son is here to buck you down
Joke's on you, if you're the biggest duck in town
You got to relax, we got to kick back
Brothers just sit back, enjoy me like a six pack
As I let the rhyme flow into the hook
Yo where you gettin took, but that's another story, black
'Cause I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
You know I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
Night in a stiff block, hangin up the pimp's jock
Used to call me Pimp Poppa, 'cause I likes to hip-hop
'Cause I'm down with Cypress, illin' well I might
Begin to take your girl, your girl she's the flyest
Flyer than the other broad, workin off the pitched rod
Isn't that odd, instead of sayin my dick's hard
It's not about knockin you, do you feel like clockin' loot?
Forget it act stupid little sucker I'll be clockin' you
With the right or left hand, duck they was still stand
Troopers on the side step, bucks him down to death man
With the greater lyric, if you can spare it
Just an ass kickin' is what you inherit
So don't try to snake off, you know I can't be shook off
Why the suckers took off? Well that's another story black
'Cause I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
You know I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One
Standin on the corner, close to the real estate
Clones they really pull stickin brothers try to imitate
Meaning when they simulate, but they can't stimulate
Like a faded joint, stiff from the breath I take
Make me act loco, they switchin' up my vocal
Out to catch you so-called, MC's with a roll call
Then you gotta close your eyes, you can't stand the sunlight
There is just one light, the Tribe's buckin' heads tonight
Buck buck buck ya head! Sorry that red is dead
Deader than a door nail, someone cold made his bed
Didn't just break out, the sucker got cracked out
Hit the pipe and blacked out, with the shit from back down
So much more integrity, greatest deal I hook up
Was a funky looker, but that's another story black
'Cause we're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones
We're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones
We're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones
You know we're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones"

Finger up on the pen, be like ""He the bomb, dicky!""

Turn up my level adjust my voice pitch

You swore, it was a nuclear war, crisis
In your back yard, word to God, Def Squad!

Word up you'll get hurt up like the jury callin murder
You're deaf 'cause I freak shit you neva heard of
Verse Four: MC Eiht
Steppin to the park in the Hill you can't hang
The original baby gangsta on this Compton thang
Don't slip, the late night hype, is when I dip
Boo-yaa is the sound from a lonely clip
Can't feel me, if I was crack you'd try to steal me
Heard you, and your little crew, wanna peel me
Keep your hands on your hood, you get got
The Green-Eyed Bandit, Cypress Hill, and the Funk Doctor Spock
You wish you could hang, like I hang
Dwells in the C-P-T, the hood thing

With the time and the emotion, and the money invested
And if you think hard
No one elses game is tighter
Check the network, up in ya fucking service provider
I bought you thug shit
Thought you drug shit
Got you bugged shit
Tell me what we havent done

Leave you understanding what the street life is
But you haters never understand

You better
Get on your concentration
If you ready to roll on me
And good bitches if you wanna unload on me
'Cause if you miss you won't get that far
Ill have you jumping fences
And running down the treet like a track star
I'm at the finish line, its essential

To advance, in my life believe it
It takes a stand to be a man

Fools trying to be hard
They only act the role
You little sorry ass bitches, Ill smack you hoes
Try to fool people
Make 'em think you something your not
I'm exposing all you bitches

I kept you by me, but when we separated I was thinkin' foolishly
Remember when your Ex-Boy tried to bug on me
I told to bring it on and (?) on me
He didn't like that but didn't want the fight
Fuck 'I'm, he didn't know how to treat you right
We go hand in hand they don't understand a man
But you do and I really respect that, damn
We been down so long but it's all good
That's why I dedicate this song
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Till Death Do Us Part
I do
(Verse Two: B-Real)
Who would have thought it would last so long
So many new ones think that they can't go wrong
I know I make so many mistakes
I know you felt neglected, you caught me outta line
If you thought I didn't respect it - I heard ya
But I never showed an emotion
If I haven't ever said it, you got on my devotion
When I fell hard you picked me up
Maybe think about my life where I'm going a little tricky - Huh?
I know there were time where you thought I would change
But I'm the same motherfucking brother even in spite of the fame
There might be some times we don't agree on some
But don't never feel your thoughts don't mean nothing
Some have tried to steal (?), I'm not one of those people
Always tell it like it is, 'cause the (?) but don't get mad
When truth is leaving I'm only telling you 'cause I got your back
(Verse Threee: B-Real)
You got my mind right and I don't know how you did it
When I trip not too many who can put with it
But you still there, still care so well - oh yeah
Got so much love (?)
I appreaciate what you're doing for me
I had to open up my eyes so I can see the minutes we lost
Whenever I was out on tour (?) we could make it up like never before
You want all the little things that make it work it
Why not, we can get it, we both deserve it
It's hard but (?) good, it's ever so easy
We have a bond that wont break, no mistake, believe me
Till Death Do Us Part, like I said from the start
You're the light that guides me through when I'm in the dark
They said we'd neverlast but we're still strong
That's why I dedicate this song - C'mon
(Sound of someone blowing out a candle)
I do
I do

It's been a while now
Been around the block many miles
Many faces, many places
That I found friends
Places where I spend time, places where my mind roam
Places I can call home
Places I can get stoned
I just wanna be alone
When I'm feelin' in my zone
People want to knock me down
'Cause they never have their own
They won't get the best of me
But they try hopelessly
Why you wanna fuck wit' me?
I'm not, what you s'posed to be?
You could not give a DAMN
Coulda just Killed A Man
Sawn off in my hand
But I had to kill the plan
Think I've found my piece of mind
Feet planted on the ground
I just had to redefine, what I thought to myself
It all goes around me and others who would down me
Who I don't give a fuck about, Trouble always found me,
I know used to welcome it with my arms open wide,
Trouble's hand's on the door, but it can't come INSIDE!
No trouble's at my door!
You want trouble, c'mon,
You want trouble?
You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?
Sen Dog:
Trouble on the line, all the fuckin' time
Got me contemplatin' the solution, the fusion my wicked mind
Got suckers that hate me but it don't really matter
I'm like a gat when I bust, niggas run and scatter
Movin' in circles, throwin' elbows and fists
You got to be a real nigga in a Cypress Hill pit
Lotta critics talkin' shit, but I'm not concerned
A hundred G's for sixty minutes is the bank I earn
I try to put it to you BLUNTLY so you bitches can learn
That no-body get tired when it's time to burn
With so many phonies out there a lot of you have been fooled
In to actually believin' that some shit is cool
Take the blinders off and go look for yourself
Fuck hearin' about shit from somebody else
I'm down for myself, I back up myself
Put in all on the line make sure that I'M FELT!
No trouble's at my door!
You want trouble, c'mon,
You want trouble?
You want trouble, c'mon
You want trouble?
B-Real : No!
B-Real:
Look, the wall's closin' in
And my shoe's wearin' thin
Had to be the biggest clown that you couldn't comprehend
Some hated on my game, said I wouldn't be the same
Called me ""Rock Superstar"", ""Insane In The Brain""
But I know I haven't changed
So I brush you to the side
Trouble's knockin' on the door, Anxious jus' to come inside
'Times I gotta block it out, no one likes to talk it out
Trouble keeps comin' and I can't seem to lock it out
Got my hands on the phone, I don't wanna have to talk
If you're feelin' funky son, then I guess you gotta jump
I can see it in your eyes, you don't seem to recognise
I wouldn't fall into your trap, for many lives to compromise
I'm not fallin' for your shit, you ain't gonna take me there
You can talk all you want, but I don't got your weight to bear
No, trouble's at my door!

Gonna beat them whose are over you
Beat down overdue
Had to learn the hard way

Shut 'em down late night

Con el perro a hueso yo lo necesito
si estas a cinco pies de mi,yo te lo quito
Pido la espalda (espalda) un payasito
Te tumbo, como un control remado
Te persigo y te sigo y te mato con un palo
Juntando raperos como adornos en la mesa
Sorpresa,te rompi la cabeza
Te pongo a dormir, con un abrazo de pescueso
No me importa lo que tengo que hacer, yo hago queso
Pasele, cuidado con mi estilo
Te mato bien matado, y a dormir un ratito...

Matando raperos y quitandote la vida

Corriendo el juego con el mismo fuego
Quemando a los demas, tirandolo en el hueco
Ya despues que queme, yo bajo la llama
Corre, escondete bajo la cama
No te hagas bobo, mi juego apretado
Listo, preparado, como un soldado
Te corto tan malo tu madre ni te conoce
A cuantos se lo hice? Tengo mas que doce
No jueges conmigo, tengo a dedo verde
Ten mucho cuidado o esta en la muerte
Pego duro, tan duro que no lo sabes
Cuando suena la campana eres uno de mis esclaves...

No vengas aqui hablando tierra ese
Como tumbo a pandilleros, se derriten como hielo

Haciendo los shows rapeando contra cualquiera
Fuerte con estilo que gente ni sabia

Vete pa tras, negro dale patadas
No vala na, dale con la mota

What you want from me?
What you, what you
What you want, what you want from me?
(B-Real)
What you want from me?
Money and the record deal
Free tickets to the shows and the free meal
What you got for me?
Besides, or your hang ups and sob stories
The violins play 'em baby
What you want to be?
Everything I am now, but you never worked for it
The live it, you fuckin' gimmick
What you want -- disease?
For me and my homies
Niggas want to act, damn, you don't even know me
What you need to breathe?
To think it over clearly, you can hear me over the speaker
It's best you don't come near me
What you got for me?
Back up and a lot of weight, but now
You hatin' on me, in every single way
What you have with me?
To make me turn the switcher
Funny how money makes a fuckin' little picture
What it's got to be?
You get disconnected over methods you choose
To make yourself get ejected
(Chorus: B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you, what you
What you want, what you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you, what you want?
What you, what you want from me?
(Sen Dog)
What you want from me?
Pictures and the demos
You wanna act funny?
And hear my layo
What you got to see?
I need a little privacy
You don't even know of the shit that drivin' me
What you need from me?
Someone to put your shit on
Never forget what I've done for you
Before you get on
What you have to be?
True to the family
And fuck 'em and feed em
If you ain't understandin me?
What you want to be?
Hard or a pop star
Goin' out and doin' the same shit
That's a love song
What you want from me?
Nothin' but burn riches down, I should grab your jaw
And knock it off the hinges now
What you after me?
Doctors and nurses and hearses
And the worst thing you feelin' the blood curses
What you have to be?
Gone another memory
Remember this if I gotta choose over them or me
I'll choose me motherfucker you understand...
(B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me what you want
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
(Chorus: B-Real)
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
What you, what you
What you want, what you want from me?"
171,What's Your Number?,2004,Till Death Do Us Part (2004),,Cypress Hill,"Let's go!
I met her at the club, her friend liked me but she didn't.
She noticed a lot of girls giving up their phone digits.
She didn't want to be one of those ho's whose clothes
Exploiting their body's from head to toes. She had glossy lips,
She was swaying her hips on the dance floor and every nigga's
Flashing the grips trying to impress her in vain,
She gave no play, Niggaz hit her up for numbers and she said no way.
I thought to myself let it go the girl on beat,
But like Smoky said she really had a hold on me.
I couldn't stop staring I started to fantasize with her.
Voices in my head said she's tantalizing ya. Even if I
Moved to the other side of the party I had pictures in my
Head of her moving that body. I was beside myself with conquer
Pain so I slowly walked over and I asked her name
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you,
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, Girl
Give me a chance
She gave a smile but I got no answer though it took a while
Before she could gave a chance she sat too cool. I offered her
A drink she turned me down flat she said If you want my name
You gotta do better than that. I said, Okay, now your shit
Don't stink, I'ma walk away, only tried to buy you a drink.
As I began to walk away she said I'm sorry for reals, but every
Guy in the club tries slipping me pills, I don't trust that each
And everyone would lie to you I said I understand but that's
Not what I tried to do, I wasn't even gonna go to your table but
If I didn't, I knew that I'd regret it later. I go after what I
Want but I got class. For me no need to slip a pill if I want.
She gave me a funny look, I couldn't tell what it meant. She let
Her guard down and on the conversation went
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you,
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, Girl
Give me a chance
Lets go!
She said: I want a man with the plan and ambition, not an immature nigger
On a pussy-hit mission. I'm too good for that, I've got so much to offer.
Got a good job, working at my mom and dad's law firm. You got
Goals? that's what she asked, Yeah, I want to fill my home with
Platinum plaques. It takes hard work but you know it's coming
After. She said Oh My God! You must be a famous rapper. I do
All right, but I'm never satisfied. I'm told 'when you still love
What you do it never gets old'. I strive for more but that's enough
About me. Why don't we skip out the club, take a walk on the street?
We slipped outta the club with no worries, seemed she wanted to get
Out in a hurry. We hung all night, and we lost our friends... till
They caught us banging in the back of a Benz.
What's your name? What's your number?
I would like to get to know you,
Can we have a conversation?
The night is young, Girl
Give me a chance
Let's go!"
172,Whatta You Know,1996,Unreleased & Revamped (1996),,Cypress Hill,"(Whatta you know?) (3x)
B-Real:
Whatta you know? The nigga stole my dough
So I reached in the closet for the 4-4
(Whatta you know?) Jus' hold on, just wait a minute
It's gone, along with my big bad nickel-plated
Whatta you know? The fucker took my phone
I still can't believe that he robbed my home!
Whatta you know? I think he got to the herb
And the ferria, and the jewlery, and the Mausberg
Whatta you know? I can't find my keys to the 6-5
All the way live on D's
Whatta you know? I can't find my Rolex
With the 21 diamonds, shinin' on flecks
Whatta you know? When I find that mark-ass nigga,
I'ma cut out his fuckin' heart!
Sen-Dog:
Whatta you know? I came up on this baller
For the dollar and the weed sack, and his Impala!
Whatta you think, when you can't trust your so-called homie
Like me, and you thought that you know me?
Whatta you feel, when you're lookin' in the closet
And the gat's gone, and so is your cellular phone?
Whatta you know? I took your loot and the jewels
With the buddah and the laptop in the nickel-plated tool!
Whatta you know? Now I run the show
With the phat pockets and the nigga's fly gold
Wahtta you think, when ya ass gets jacked 
By a homie who was supposed to have your back?
B-Real:
Whatta you know? I'm rollin' in my zone
And I think I see the puto who rigged my home
(Whatta you think?) I got the glock in the glove
Should I dump on the man, leave him lying in the mud?
Wahtta you know? He pulled out my 4-4
Now I got no choice, so I let it all flow
(Whatta you know?) The motherfucker's all blastin'
4-5 equal, in time for some tractions
(Whatta you know?) Slide action, no question
Forty-five slug is bad for your complexion
(Whatta you know?) The puto's cryin' like a bitch
Now the puto's lyin' in a fuckin' ditch!
B-Real (spoken):
(Whatta you know?) You can't even trust your fuckin' best homeboy these days, homes.
(Whatta you know?) You got to sleep with one nine fuckin' open ...
(Whatta you know?) Payback's a motherfuckin' bitch!
(Whatta you know?) That puto should've watched his fuckin' back.

175,Worldwide,2000,Skull & Bones (2000),,Cypress Hill,"(Verse 1: Sen-Dog)
You better hope I'm chained up, shackled with a yard
I'll snatch you by the neck, bide you like a tech
Wreck fools when I disconnect, make you sweat
Shit your pants, get in yuor step on my advance
Catch a glance of the legendary brother who carries
Your body and buries two more lyrics in styles varied
Fool what? You ain't got nothin' to say
I been backin' up east side LA, all day
Blowin' up the best techs, the best flex
Havin' the best sex, fuckin' in Wessex
The hardcore shit, I know you like it raw
'Cause ain't no other Dog breakin' the last straw
(Chorus (2x): B-Real)
You better bounce, nigga, smoke an ounce, nigga
'Cause you rollin' with the Hill and what counts is uh,
Can you hang with us? You wanna bang with us?
Cypress Hill, worldwide, Los Angeles
(Verse 2: Sen-Dog)
I don't bark, I just bite, mangle and maim niggas up
Check your strap, they mangle us and pick us up
Fool, now you tremblin', I give you three seconds
To break out before you resemblin' a dead man
A hole through your headband
My gat's in my right hand, my plug's in my left hand, punk
Cypress Hill worldwide, you just a local
Don't anger me, or you can hear it in my vocal
You don't want that strap on my hip
To deal out, the repercussions dug a fat lip
I'm buckin' at the room soon to the boom
Fuckin' with your head like the 'shroom you consume
(Chorus (2x): B-Real)
You better bounce, nigga, smoke an ounce, nigga
'Cause you rollin' with the Hill and what counts is uh,
Can you hang with us? You wanna bang with us?
Cypress Hill, worldwide, Los Angeles
(BR) Bitches, you're all thick-eyed, a weak ride
I take money-money, make dummies all night
Use the mic, bruise the mic, we choos the mic
When you sorry niggas go off and lose the mic
(SD) We choose a life right, we roll with crew tight
See the light at the end of a tunnel - a gat barrel
Wettin' up your flyest apparel, a cane ray
You forget me and I'll be back to refresh your fuckin' memory
Remember me now, Cypress Hill soldier
Up and down the boulevard, big money folder
You bring descript sequence with no defense
The whole defense hittin' the bones while you sleepin'
(Chorus (2x): B-Real)
You better bounce, nigga, smoke an ounce, nigga
'Cause you rollin' with the Hill and what counts is uh,

Yo quiero fumar... mota

Mucha gente me decia, que yo no podia
Fumar marijuana por la policia
Me vale madre el humo que hay por todo el aire
Si tu quieres que me toque pues caele
Soy el grifo mas escandaloso
De Los Angeles Cypress peligroso
Enciende el leño o la pipa
Pasalo por mi clica la que rifa
Mota rica, chipa chipa
Quemando yesca, estoy arriba
Es algo que yo hago diario
Al despertar y tambien todo el dia en mi barrio
Cuando me encuentres en cualquier lugar
Saca papeles porque quiero fumar mota...

Yo quiero fumar... mota..."
