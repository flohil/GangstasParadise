2,Ain't Waiting,2011,Gutter Rainbows (2011),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"Once upon a time in a land far far away
I tried to play but my heart in the way
This part a little harder to say
It's like a white girl trapped in a well
Help is coming but its scary as hell
But very well here go the fairy tale
Now Cinderella want a fella who is not so ghetto
So she follow bread crumbs like Hansel and Gretel
Hello that'll make her drop her underwear
Dough longer than Rapunzel hair
Everyone stare when she walk in she like
What you want
Yo I'm not in the front I be blunt my make that ass bump
I know that's what they want
Me too with my hands up she turn around like man
Here I am
But I know her from work she pass by like he ain't that fly you got
One more chance
To fall down the rabbit hole
Let me take you to Wonderland or I'm making some other plans
I don't wanna spend the night
Trying to figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time
Waiting for you waiting for you
I don't wanna spend the night
Trying to figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time
Waiting for you waiting for you
Everybody say oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Waiting for you waiting for you
Say oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Waiting for you waiting for you
I made you a star your light was shining it's so right
So right that it dwarfed the chicks like Snow White
So nice got down with the team and now you one of us
Got me singing like prince you sexy motherfuh
You could be my princess bride call you my buttercup
I love when you letting me be the man
Let me take you by the hand like Wendy in Petter Pan
If you fly by night that's right I'll let you make a wish
That's right eat you up like a favorite dish
Man I pray you not the wicked witch
Made it through
A situation where I broke my promise now I'm tryna be honest love
So can you
Sometimes people evolve but that involves knowing exactly
What you want
And right now I wanna [?]
What they want
My life is an open book you had a chapter but will it end happily ever after
I don't wanna spend the night
Trying to figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time
Waiting for you waiting for you
I don't wanna spend the night
Trying to figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time
Waiting for you waiting for you
Everybody in the house say oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Waiting for you waiting for you
Oh oh oh oh oh
Say it with me oh oh oh oh oh
Say it with me oh oh oh oh
Waiting for you waiting for you
Life ain't a fairy tale
Now they say sister's bitter and the brothers is grim
Time to let the story end and let another begin
I spun straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Still a hole in my soul that love won't fill in
She Sleeping Beauty cause her eyes are closed
Tried to sleep on your boy like Brian Rose
Get you wide like the coke in your nose
And I'm lying like Pinocchio
Gotta know when its time to go gotta know when
Here we are
We had some good times had some Little Red Riding Hood times but
Once again
I'm the big bad wolf don't hit me with the sad look love
Here I am
I'm still the same old me but I don't know if we should give it
One more chance
To add another chapter life ain't always happily ever after
I don't wanna spend the night
Trying to figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time
Waiting for you waiting for you
I don't wanna spend the night
Trying to figure out how to spend my life
I don't wanna spend my time
Waiting for you waiting for you"

Around my way...
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way...
Around my way...
Around my way...
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way...
People let me paint a picture
You know I ain't a christian
I ain't a muslim, ain't a jew
I'm losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
'Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you, but I don't fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel, truly knowing Jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham, Lord'll follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block, I'm tracing your footsteps, I keep the faith in you
Your love, plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through, my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggaz looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive, shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters, rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin' gypsy cabs and chasin' 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad
The way we saluting flags, wrapping them around our heads
When niggaz ain't become American till 9/11
Feeling like you gotta sneak into heaven
When the reverend looking like a pimp and the pimp look like the reverend
Around my way...
Around my way...
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way...
These conditions make us strong
And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own
A mix tape freestyle become your favorite song
No place like home when the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you, threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guys like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
L.A. to Chicago like Smooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four, cock it back
Drop the flow, rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
You'll finish school, but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood, you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that, this is a legacy and we a part of that
The hood is where my heart is at
Catch me around my way
Around my way...
Around my way...
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with hate
Around my way...
Around my way...
Around my way...
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way..."

Tina Farris's pay King to Paris
Living long, making my kids heirs and heiresses
The family crest, the legacy, the heritage
I'm out of Philly where the ecstasy and syrup is
And we don't need Theraflu, we need therapists
Them never-ending pursuit of them dead presidents
Is the reason I got the band back together, bitch
Yeah, it's me and [???], and his [???]
North side, bomb squad, Eric Vietnam
If you don't see it like I see it then you see it wrong
We October 3rd niggas like me and Kwe'
Life got me in a state on the interstate
And all I'm thinking bout is what's up on my dinner plate
Meanwhile I make your girls hyperventilate
Prolly 'cause I live the kind of life art imitate
That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands
We living next door to the Aquilius again
Pardon me fam
But I'mma show you how it is
I'mma show you how we get in
Rocking the Guy Fawkes mask like Anonymous
Passport pimping like I'm going outta town to flip
The ass for a symbol with the cops hopping out of whips
Bath salt niggas with the zombies apocalypse
I'm blessed cause my afterlife is the studio
This rappers life is gangster's paradise like I'm Coolio
That's what a few believe like a doobie roll
We off of that Patrón, we sipping the Don Julio
You talking shit? we don't need the chatter
Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth
That's when I'm letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out
Better let it off cause you set it off
The music that's creating a movement like it's December 4th
Threw away the dark meat but they ate the white
Animated like it's kind of darklit it's my wicked life
It imitate my life
That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands
We living next door to the Aquilius again
Pardon me fam
But I'mma show you how it is
I'mma show you how we get in
Yeah, y'all keeping it 3hunnid, we keeping it 360
Coming full circle echelon don emcees with me
Tired of saying I'm the best, I won't waste another breath
Heard lyrics coming back, I say it never left
Y'all just catching up, so slow to come around
Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down
'Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it, and set the precedence
And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff
Nice being self employed, ain't gotta kiss ass
I ain't gotta slim fast, smack a ho with a love handle
Dare you to say you ain't a fan boo, roll a bamboo
Life imitating art imitating life, show you how the fam do
That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands
We living next door to the Aquilius again
Pardon me fam
But I'mma show you how it is
I'mma show you how we get in"

Calling for sex
So emotional tear gonna fall
I applaud your agility
Should you really be deserving an encore standing ovation
Old faces, Got you feeling all flush
'Cause we are touching in public places
In the studio ???
Making amateurs movies in a condo
You gonna need a toe-tag like John Doe
When I'm wilding out with my tongue like Jon Snow
Every sword need a chief
Animal attraction like I'm lord of the beast

You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh

Yo, I heard it's said the revolution won't be televised
But in the land of milk and honey there's a date you gotta sell it by
Otherwise it just expires and spoils
And these folks jump out the pot when the water too hot
'Cause the fire boils inside
You go to church to find you some religion
And all you hear is connivin' and gossip and contradiction and
You try to vote and participate in the government
And the muh'fuckin' Democrats is actin' like Republicans
You join an organization that know black history
But ask them how they plan to make money and it's a mystery
Lookin' for the remedy but you can't see what's hurtin' you
The revolution's here, the revolution is personal
They call me the political rapper
Even after I tell 'em I don't fuck with politics
I don't even follow it

No it's 'cause I'm dope, if I was wack I'd be irrelevant
I'm like the dope in your tracks until your high is settled in
You leanin' to the left, the laughter's the best medicine
But the troubles you have today you just can't laugh away
Stay optimistic, they can change, it's gon' come like Donny Hathaway
You have to pray, on top of that, act today
'Cause opportunity shrivel away like Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away""
Everybody pass away, the past will pay, the family mournin'
Everybody act accordin' to the season that they born in
You fight in the streets, start bleedin' till the blood is pourin'
In the gutter, mothers cry till the Lord be livin' by the sword and
All that folks want is safety, they goin' gun crazy
The same reason Reagan was playin' war games in the '80s
The same reason I've always rocked dog chains on my babies
The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery
The revolution's here (yeah)
No one can lead you off your path (uh uh)

Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music
I'm from a small city, but I have big dreams
Had some good ideas, but I had better schemes
I thought the hustle way for me was etched in stones
Until my pun to dime and name etched in stone
My daughter's growing up, my son on his way
They closing in on me, I feel like every day
Music saves me, soothing like the navy
But a lifetime of scars only sixteen bars
So I took the vibe with me using my life
Yep, I propose the main music my wife
If ever need to call a nigga music's my night
And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dice
If I degraded and I haven't even cried to
I watch purpose prophesize about going through
Music ain't the knowledge itself
And I'm the knowledge itself, then I acknowledge your wealth

Beating up the track with brutal lines
The truth inside of me, rappers hit the booth and they lie to me
I'm using the inspiration that they provide to me
I'm redefining the space, you can call me the new geometry
A picture of you, papa, when I google monogamy
Now all the people who go irresponsibly
Thinking your album is trash is not the root of economy
So you're expecting the conscious and introspect of use
Each of lyrical vestibule, let me tell you what's best for you
My music gives you a message true or respect is due
But music is emotion, that's lost for me intellectual
A tree in form of a far is never heard
Amongst the sparrows and the robbers and even the ghetto birds
You download it for free but what I create the same
Of course you're nothing but a pair in making, trust me
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music
I was born on the afterbeat, I'm like ron for Johnson
When you reach the crossroads me and the devil have to meet
It's all the same thing as clever Lauryn when they saw it
Lauryn went, looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin'
Willing to the same songs but we hear them different
Serenade the death like we got a fear of living
Having the sounds on stage cause the spirit rising
Stop the devilish ways where clever displays the lyricism
The songs are a natural resource of actual street stories
Attract the police forces
Slay to the rhythm the masses that rip off us
And he could run before he walked"

I do it for the people, I do it for the love
I do it for the poet, I do it for the thug
This is for victory, and this is for the slaughter
I do it for my mother, I do it for my daughter
Promise I'll always love ya, I love to kiss and hug ya
You and your brother should be lookin' out for one another
I'm so blessed, man, y'all the reason I got up
Somebody put his hands on you I'm gettin' locked up
I'm not playin', that's the prayer I'm sayin' for Diani
And if I die then she'll be protected by Amani
That's her bigger brother and I love the way he love her
She a girly-girl, she love to imitate her mother
But she a Gemini, so stay on her friendly side
She'll put that look on you, it's like somebody' friend just died
My pretty black princess smell sweet like that incense
That you buy at the bookstore supporting black business
Teach her what black is; the fact is her parents are thorough
She four reading Cornrows by Camille Yarborough
I keep her hair braided, bought her a black Barbie
I keep her mind free; she ain't no black zombie
This is for Aisha, this is for Kashera
This is for Khadijah scared to look up in the mirror
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a black girl name, she livin' black girl pain
This is for Makeba, and for my mamacita
What's really good, ma? I'll be your promise-keeper
I see the picture clearer through the stain on the frame
She got a black girl name, she livin' black girl pain
My mama said life would be so hard
Growin' up days as a black girl scarred
In so many ways though we've come so far
They just know the name they don't know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Don't be ashamed of yourself know I
Will carry it forth till the day I die
They just know the name they don't know the pain black girl
(Jean Grae)
This is for Beatrice Bertha Benjamin who gave birth to
Tsidi Azeeda for Lavender Hill for Kyalisha
ALTHLONE, Mitchells Plain, Swazi girls I'm reppin for thee
Mannesburg, Guguletu where you'd just be blessed to get through
For beauty shinin through like the sun at the highest noon
From the top of the cable car at Table Mountain; I am you
Girls with the skyest blue of eyes and the darkest skin
For Cape Colored allied for realizing we're African
For all my cousins back home, the strength of mommy's backbone
The length of which she went for raising, sacrificing her own
The pain of not reflecting the range of our complexions
For rubber pellet scars on Auntie Elna's back I march
Fist raised caramel shinin in all our glory
For Mauritius, St, Helena; my blood is a million stories
Winnie for Joan and for Edie, for Norma, Leslie, Ndidi
For Auntie Betty, for Melanie; all the same family
Fiona, Jo Burg, complex of mixed girls
For surviving through every lie they put into us now
The world is yours and I swear I will stand focused
Black girls, raise up your hands; the world should clap for us
My mama said life would be so hard
Growin' up days as a black girl scarred
In so many ways though we've come so far
They just know the name they don't know the pain
So please hold your heads up high
Don't be ashamed of yourself know I
Will carry it forth till the day I die

This the story of - Lucy In The Sky Wit Diamonds
Ask her why she crying, she wanna live, she got no time for dying
Was a science, dreams too big for a small town
She gotta get to New York and watch a door fall down
Hopped off the Greyhound, gotta make her way now
She sleeping on the park benches in the playground
But cash burn quick, don't wanna have to turn trick
Ready to quit till she met the super pimp
Flashing his toothy smile that drove little Lucy wild
She quick to hop up on his dick straight Hoopie style
She let the fella hit but she sang she sell-a-bit (celebate)
He ain't buying that, she ain't selling it
She looking for love in all of the above
Believing videos, trying to back up all on a thug
Who wanna - put it in her, withdraw like a Citi card
But now she shake that ass for tips at the titty bar

Broken glass - everywhere! (IT'S LOUDER!)

Dreams shattered like broken glass
Press ignore it and your hopes get broken fast
You complain for the life you supposed to have
But when you try to make plans God is known to laugh
Throw a song on the phonograph, and Lucy start wilin
The trick start smiling, watch the loot start flying
The Gucci start pilling up, she live designer plush
Start lining up the coke so she could find a rush
Time's up, she's about to turn 33
Her shit started to sag, she got surgery
Now cats are used to drive past her like a Church van
Acting on thirst, 'She Wants To Move' like a N.E.R.D. fan
Bigger house, 10,000 dollar purse fam
She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man
She the ring leader in a clique of birds
And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain

She was a small city girl with big city dreams
Niggaz try to figure how to get up in them jeans
Put her in them scenes, get her on the team
Hit her wit the cream till they figured out the schemes
Now she all up in the club looking for a new love
Really like Huey Lewis looking for a new drug
Cause coke's getting old, started free basing
Graduated to crack, smack on occasion
Not catching the bus, but back at the station
Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient
Last hundred dollars, she got to 'Get By'
Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high
Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame
Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name
She need a ticket home if it's the right course
Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse

And I'm swearin' to God I air all y'all
I live by the sword or the pistols
Summertime I'm outside with niggaz with pitbulls
I don't smoke the haze if it ain't got the crystals
Look in my eyes you can tell I would lift you
I'm in the DB nine when I'm comin' to get you
I'm with my Arab man and he holdin' the missiles
I'm sayin' fuck all y'all
If you don't understand let me make it real clear I'm sayin' what to all y'all
No more videos or them silly hos ridin' on y'all dick when I cut all y'all

I wanna see the barrel flame till they brains get mushy

Ain't no other rapper in the game that you know that plays the streets so close

What's up Franklin Avenue?
These Brooklyn niggaz runnin' wild through the jungle like caribou
Rap immaculate

Old school and cooler than the river watered downstream
Hit the block hotter than them grits poured in Al Green
The cops flashin' the lights, passin' them bikes
Ask for ya rights and they beat you like ""The Passion Of Christ""
They got a sicker fetish for violence than Mel Gibson
We inject it in our system through direct television
The way I'm spittin' Heaven through the Hell we living
It's like fate is a fakery style you can tell it's written
It's like a jail when you're sittin' in a cell or prison
With destiny comin' in the form of some mail or a visit

Cause my heart skip a beat

Tear into the flesh of the weak
Currency bear the mark of the beast
Never stand for the bull
Even when the market asleep
Anything I want is in arms reach
And the score is so sweet
But the consequence is that
I got to wear the mark of the thief
I am the man with one hand
Stranger in a foreign land
New identity cost a grand
It's the miracle worker
Serving up the offering
So make the disabled walk again
Got the melatonin, pouring in from the pineal gland
Like the blind man that saw again
Like el-Hajj Malik
Street cats fought for him
And they never ate pork again

It's been a long time coming!
Let me try something brand new
Hey yo Ski!
What you ever do, man?
Come on!
Yo, what we doing it for?
This is for all the day-trippers and the hipsters
Whores and the fashionistas
Spiritual leaders practicing all the laws of attraction
The teachers who read the passages from the Bhagavad Gita
That be bustin' off Dalai Lama's or flashing heaters
The last of the boosters
With the shooting, the thugging and all the booning and spooning
And all the crooning, and cooning and auto-tuning, alive
You be tellin', peddlin' to consumers I'm helping them to see through it
Get with this new movement, let's move it
Feel the cold rain
Still I'm standing right here
Even the winter summer days
Yeah I'm a product of Reaganomics
From the blocks where he rocking the feds like J Electronica
Drop and make this a lock
If he promises where the heart is
Whether Jesus or Mohammed, regardless of where the mosque is
They hope for the Apocalypse like a self-fulfilling prophecy
Tell me when do we stop it?
Do they ask you your religion before you rent an apartment?
Is the answer burning Korans
So that we can defend Islamics?
The end is upon us with a hashtag - a trending topic
You take away the freedoms that we invite in the game
Then you disrespect the soldiers, you ask them to die in vain
In a desert praying for rain
The music's like a drug, and they tend to take it to vein
It ain't for the well-behaved
The soundtrack for when you're great but its more for when you've felt afraid
More than your average rapper
So you sort of felt the way
The brain is like a cage, you a slave, that is why they lovin' you
This is the book that Eli that start with a KW
Feel the cold rain
Still I'm standing right here
Even the winter summer days
I do it for the trappers, other rappers
The Backpackers, the crackers
The niggas, the metal-packers
The victims of ghetto factories
I do it for the families, citizens of humanity
MC's, endangered species like manatees
I do it for the future of my children
They the hope for the hopeless
Karma approaches, we're gon' be food for a flock of vultures
The end of the world, ain't nothing left but the cockroaches and the freedom fighters
We're freedom writers like Bob Moses, the chosen freedom writers like Voltaire
For my block, my borough, my hood, my city, my state, yeah
My obligation to my community is so clear
We gotta save them, this opportunity so rare
We do it so big over here that it's no fair
To the punks, the bitches, the chumps, the snitches, the sneak in the game
We let them live with although they're weak and they're lame
The bozo's and joker's, promotin' when they're speaking my name

Acquire every color in the spectrum

Starts bringing me down that's the depravity of gravity
Having me in my blue phase
Go off the grid for a few days
Go on a journey without a suitcase
The security of obscurity in a world of respect
And I'm trading it like a currency
Currently you soft as a mallet hitting a xylophone
He so yella I'm wishin' his fella right his wrong
But naw, instead he is synthetic as styrofoam
Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome
My light'll poke through the clouds
We'll take you higher like you smoking the loud
While I provide the dope kaleidoscope of sound
You can see it with your ears
You can hear it with your eyes
You can feel it right here yeah

Growing up in Brooklyn, shit I thought that everybody talked this way
Raised on Rakim and Run-D.M.C., so we thought that everybody (walked this way)
""We fresh, we chill, we def, we ill,"" it's just some things that was taught to say
And every Saturday morning, I watched cartoons with a bowl of Frosted Flakes
And... the puberty came, started hitting them cuties with game and the truancy came (uh!)
Started cutting in acting class, I was comin' all fast, I was new to the game (uh!)
Used to playin' on TV, courtesy of video music box
Plus! Knew a lot of hustlas, goin' O.T., comin' back with the new hip-hop
Like! E-40 holding down the yay (that yay), N.W.A. in L.A.
OutKast from the A-Town, way down in Houston they play the UGK
I walk and talk kinda fast and thought of as a New York kinda rhymer (word is bond)
But must New Yorkers got family in South and North Carolina (come on!)
L.A. is little Alabama, they walk and they talk with a country grammar
And you think everybody else sound country, so they get started, started callin 'em ""Bama

Down south where life is cheap, where they quick to fill you up with slugs

Growing up in P.A., I knew nobody out there talked like us
Nothin' but that county slang, ""What up dog? What up cuzz?""
Late night you see us guzzling 40's, menthols, wine, and weed
Sitting on the back porch, getting zooted, feeling fine in deed
Listening to Eric B.and Rakim or EPMD
Cool C and Steady B, plus that Public Enemy
Not to mention N.W.A., DJ Quik, and MC Eiht
Down south we listen to it all, we didn't discriminate
Better off them Geto Boys, Raheem, and the Royal Flush
Rap-A-Lot Records based out in Houston, represents for us
O.G. style, they cars, fix them vogues with human trouble
Our squad is gangsta nigga, put it down for H-Town on the double
So I said, ""It's time to hustle,"" got down with my brother C
Put together UGK and shit the rest is history
We make hits by the dozen, put it down when they said we wasn't

It was amazing and my brother put me up on Black Star
Starving blacks on the news, I weighed
'Cause we isolate ourselves and give our ghetto pass away

They mommas depleted, I'm just tryna make sure that their kids straight
I'm on the chitalin tour with my mic in my hand
Shittin on these jealous niggaz in the new world clan
I wouldn't trade it for nothin', only a crazy man would
I represent for the whole South, I made it just for my hood
The pimpin's good...
(Raheem DeVaughn)
I got cousins (I got cousins), country cousins (country cousins)
Like blood that's thicker than water (it's nothin'), down dirty 'cross the border
I got cousins (I got cousins), country cousins (country cousins)
Like blood that's thicker than water (it's nothin'), down dirty 'cross the border
In my country cousins!"
17,Delicate Flowers,2013,Prisoner Of Conscious (2013),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"My girl is a delicate flower, a super-hero
Being a single mom helped her develop the powers
We stay up to a elegant hour talking the hell and the sour
Reaching out to god cause the devil a coward
But he still sits on my shoulder and whispers
It feels like my shoulder gets colder the more that I listen
And now it seems like she ready to leave
We stay to beef the main reason my desire to spreading my seed
I try to tell her I'm just a man
She said ""no, you're wrong, 'cause you're way more than that
You need to cut the scheme
You're not fooling me, this lunacy
Them excuses might be new to the birds, but they ain't new to me.""
Yo, I hate when the fit is proun, is like
Everytime I pick up the phone you bitch moan, whoa
I'm like why you stressing for, press to the norm
Make me wanna never get involved
I need to rip these benefits
Uh, you so sensitive
I say serve this rarity
She say I deserve your loyalty
Girls have feelings
Men lie out of fear but we front like we're not afraid
Whether arguing or not, the bills gotta get paid
We are not in 6th grade, we're fighting and people watching
On tweeter she emo-blogging, I'm boiling the hemoglobin
And lead the side the arguments never move me
'Cause we acting out the stereotypes like Tyler Perry movies
My indiscretion is reeking in deep betrayal
The beat is on like horses, is hard to keep 'em stable
She believed me the way Michael believed in Fredo
But I need her, she the proof in my soul, my sweet potato
Before I let her go I know she'll be forever gone
I can't leave when the weather roam or weather storms
She like a tree, now got me looking for Fema
Cover in my neighbor's lawn the grass is looking greener
But in reality it never is
I'm sure there's others, but I'll never find a better
Girls have feelings
Girls have feelings
Girls have feelings
They surely, surely do"

You don't see 'em?
For real?
Look around, son
Look around, son
Take a trip, I got you floating on this real spit
I rock the boat so much you get nauseous and start to feel sick
Too many house niggas, I'm taking 'em on a field trip
Your fate is sealed: a life that come with a kill-switch
My wife said I've got demons I've yet to deal with
But I ain't trying to hear her though, my music is my mirror though
They like to put me on a pedestal for conscious rap
My flesh is edible, it's hard to keep the monsters back
The polar opposite of too emotional
Got feelings and emotions, just hoping I don't overdose
And miss the moments trying to control 'em till I'm on overload
Or hard to handle, we get dismantled and now I'm home alone
I power trip like I'm sampling Hubert Laws no more
I got honor, face my karma like a Buddhist law
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?
Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels
The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Demons want a pound of my flesh, it's quite accurate
It's tragic when you feel like your lawyer the devil advocate
Legal-ese ain't a language, they made it up
No wonder I'm losing blood, everybody taking a cut
Speaking in tongues, they depleting your funds
Beating the drums of war to fry lines to your fortunate sons
You think boys point guns when they run to the sun?
A decoy, Pink Floyd, 'cause they're comfortably numb
Word, wrapping ourselves in denial like it's a warm blanket
Trying to go native like faces that get war painted
Pac shot in Las Vegas of all places
Fighting dark sides of the Force like he was Lord Vader
Y'all haters develop and lead the role
When they start to give 'em parts of your life and feed the trolls
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours?
Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels
The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Proof that evil words can maim you
This feel like church, save that soul
That cry ""good God, oh me, oh my!""
I got to save them all
Pray the Lord forever call on him
For setting the screen for evil things, then letting me ball on them
Pick and move, or you could die, nigga
Chuck and jive to stay alive, nigga
Propane flames burn your boots like strange perms
Some think ""Don't take, will""
But fuck it, you live and learn
Beware of the roots and salty looks
Voodoo they put on you, baby doll could leave you shook
Pens and needles, hoes and blokes
When it cracking, come snapping out even, kept them feelings afloat
I know, cause my folks lost souls off coast, never found
The triangle ain't just an ocean, it's on the ground
Take heed of the sign, dodging demons that find foregiveness
Young Krizzle
Too many demons in the dance hall
And they stomping on what you stand for
Dorothy Parker in the tub with her pants on
Ready for a night at the opera with the phantom
They live in the shadows of the angels
The punchlines of the rap battles to entertain you
Proof that evil words can maim you
Proof that evil words can maim you"

(Did you have fun at school today Trey?)
My little man go to bed so hungry
Get up, go to school with his nose runny, come home with his nose bloody
His sister laughin', he like ""What's so funny~?""
Till she drowned out by the sounds of hunger pains in his tummy
Nuttin in the freezer, nuttin in the fridge
Couple of 40 ounces but nuttin for the kids
Little man know to eat to live but he don't wanna leave the crib
The kid who punched him in his face house right down the street from his
He went anyway, more scared to face his moms
She'll beat him soon as she flip out, seein his face scarred
Walkin' past the dopefiends with they smoke to the place of God
Hopes and dreams pourin out the holes in they face and arms
Little man in the face of harm if he don't eat
He need energy so when he go to school he can compete
And keep up, all he got is bodegas
But hey he only got enough a for quarter water and a Now or Later
Anyway, grandma say Jesus'll be here any day
Good - 'cause with nuttin to eat it's gettin' hard to pray... pray...

I get it how I live, it's critical when the conditions allow you
Do you don't trust the critics who doubt you
Try to write shit about you, but they can't make a living without you
Go hungry, you gotta watch what the media feed ya
And don't be a poisoned animal eater either
It's harder than it sound, cause nowadays, put that swine in everything
The white sugar so addictive it's pure 'caine
They got, pork in the toothpaste, soda in the Sunny D
Jello brand gelatin is laced with the lecatin
In Africa they starvin, over here the food hurt you
Cows goin' mad and the chickens crunk with bird flu
It's too ill how the food kill it's like blue steel
Lies never set you free, but the truth will
The truth still matter the proof is in the batter or the pudding
You can tell we eatin good, we gettin' fatter

Say what you mean, mean what you say
You the meanest girl, you my Tina Fey
Like you out for pain, like you out for shame
But you pout when I call you out your name
Your words burnin' me, you're my bird of prey
When you feed your young, you regurgitate
What I heard you say and reverberate
But I'm a man, gotta show my vertebrae
I'm the kind to wait, you can come through with
You can run to it and get numb to it
Treat you like the Autobahn, just sung to it
Treat you like my favorite song and just jump to it
Girl you waste my bluff when we makin' love
Can't take it, love, you my favorite drug
You my fleur-de-lys, you disturb the peace
Cause you hurtin' me, you turned to me and said
Love is a potion that's fluent, let's keep it movin'
The only thing that's magic is moments, I'm only human
The only thing that's tragic is futures that we can ruin
I pound for couple of hours, double influence
Need a break from the words you're usin'

They hittin' home, but I can take a punch
I'm your David Lynch, you're my naked lunch
I found space for us, found a place for us
Used to pray for love, used to pray for us
Would've gave you my blood but you gave it up
My heart a house for this love but you sprayed it up
You can't take a brush, comments is tangled up
In a web of emotion that's dangerous
I can't make this up, that shit is lame as fuck
I ain't a slave but I'm out here tryna make a buck
Stayin' on my hustle, I ride around and I spend it
Set it into motion like butterflies to defect it
Tryin' to pretend that the words are never effective
Seem to work for a second but never be worth the effort
I'm a man and they say I ain't s'posed to run on emotions
So I let you get away with more than you were supposed to
I kept it bottled up like a note to float in the ocean
Just stop myself, I'm explodin'

Man, my pops won't let me drive until the law says that I'm able
But since he fell asleep and left his keys up on the table
I figured I'd be able to snatch 'em without permission
And he be out cold and never find out they was missin'
So I did just that and got the car up out the driveway
Then hit up Pat and we was headed toward highway
But made one stop to get some Newports and Coroners
Before we checked these chicks that we had New out and Coroner
But at the turn of corner in this bad part of town
We see this nigga Rell and he's flaggin us down
Then he walked up on the car, asked me and Pat ""What's poppin'?""
Then jumped in the backseat before I got the chance to lock it
Asked me if could we drop him even though we going elsewhere
But what poked from his shirt gave me concerns for my welfare
Cause even though his belt's there, the tech's on his waist
And he made us stop the car at the check-cashing place
Then threw a mask on his face like MF Doom
Cause there's enough cash in the safe to buy a new Lex soon
And his tone was rather smooth when he said, ""Don't make a muscle move""
Cause till I get inside the only thing I wanting y'all to do is

I always keep the gat like DMX in Arizona
In the corner of my cornea, I see the one time California
Slang for cops and they comin' by cruisin
The niggas in the ledger pealed out
The people in the check-casher spot spilled out
On the street, their faces looking like a child has been abused

Objetividade na vontade de crescer
A feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet
Yet my words are slow dancin, my language is romantic
Vocabulary that's bustin' your capillaries
My freedom'll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries
My adversaries speak ill of my name, I'm so sick
Attack is very guerilla, my game is so pimp
Everything fall into place, it's gravitational
Profit stay in the black, the shade is so un-fadeable
Healthy relationship make your other ones better
I'm Lee Scratch Perry, they call me the upsetter
For the cheddar get the bread up
Mr. International call it the bruschetta, the spiritual newsletter
I wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part
You're lookin' into my heart or just lookin' to be a part
From a boss in my prime, look how we crossin the finish line
How you tired, I stay wired like I was offered a line
É, a gente é desse jeito mesmo, é diferente
É, é brasileiro, é swingueiro, é coração
É, a gente é que bota fé na vida, pode crê

You're listenin to voodoo, I call it the black magic
You jammin up the traffic, you bubble, it don't stop
It might blow up but it won't go pop
""Pow!"" That's the sound like onomatopoeia
Got me floatin when you rockin' my boat like you Aaliyah
Got them African features like people out in Bahia
Mix tobacco with the reefer like you was a European
When I leave I'm gonna miss you, official like Kardinal
Trust I'll come back and I'll visit for carni-val
When I come back around, take me out on the town
And you can show me how you put it down
My favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love
Man I fell in love, man I fell in love

Yeah
Kweli in the house
Dave West is what I'm talkin' about, you know?
Yeah yeah yeah yo yeah yo yeah yeah yeah yo yeah yo Yeah yeah yeah yoooh yoooh
Make a joy for noise until the lord people are floored
Cause the pen is mightier than the sword
Leavin' the floor
Cause my words cut deeper than a tissue massage
I got hooks and lines that sink y'all like a fisherman's rod
I'm on mission for God he blessed me to spit it this hard
A lot of niggas start shit but they don't finish the job
I'm like Minister Farrakhan or Africans who finished a marathon
The pain in my voice is like Sarah Vaughn
No matter what playin' 'em on I carry on
Even if the dawn lit overhead I carry on
Like Flash Gordon the Scar on my Face is Brad Jordan
Passports splash with blood from the battle I last fought in
I want to cash all in
Or I start breakin' like glass jaw I put The Blast on 'em like my last tourin'
Or fast forward just to catch what I said
Yo I say some shit like that just to mess with your head, come on
Grabbin' the black steel, bowh
In the hour of chaos
We ain't rappin' till they pay us, is that real?
We got babies
We got bills
Put your hands up in the air if you know how I feel
And let it out (let it out)
Get it out (get it out)
Work it up (work it up)
Sweat it out
I don't know
If you know
My history I do it big
Like Notorious did
Get on and play like this according to kid
Gangster like knock out Ned like Little Zane slayed all on his wiz
Crazy like the little hand on the seven, the big hand on the six
J-Lo, yo
Whether you all in the mix or if you stay low
Everybody say hoo hoo hoo hoo
I don't know
If you know
My history you don't know me
Choke the game till it's blue like a varicose vein
And I can't remember the last time I felt this terrible pain
And the whole shit blew up
Was it in vain?
They'll be lookin' through the rubble like they searchin' for Hussein
I'm lookin' through the club I'm really searchin for who's sane
The music got everyone crazy and who to blame
Be prepared think there'll be some ugliness up in here
End up in intensive care with the vegetables there, you know?
Grabbin' the black steel, bowh
In the hour of chaos
We ain't rappin' till they pay us, is that real?
We got babies

Put your hands up in the air if you know how I feel
And let it out (let it out)
Get it out (get it out)
Work it up (work it up)
Sweat it out
I don't know
If you know
My history I do it big
It's the black hand bustin' the tech
Gettin' it wet without bustin' a sweat
Swingin' for the upper deck
It's the black man cuttin' a check
The nigger's the boss
The niggers want to test if they addicted to laws
I spit on the floor
The right hook will get at your jaw
Make the track my baby mama when I'm hittin' it raw
I rap through:
Wars and tours and whores on the floors I did it for force
So I spit at all the shit that I saw
I party with supermodels who wanna take of they clothes
The ones who smokin' cocaine so they don't fuck up they nose
I walked the slums of Soweto and the streets of Havana
Takin' pictures with kids who never seen a camera
From the land of the Alabama since the night in the Cali
Bumpin' gangster music like a freedoms song in the rally
Out the back of yo' Dinnali give you the skinny like Ally McBeal
It's the black steel, Brooklyn know the deal, what?!
Grabbin' the black steel, bowh
In the hour of chaos
We ain't rappin' till they pay us, is that real?
We got babies
We got bills
Put your hands up in the air if you know how I feel

There's an E! True Hollywood Story for the pluckin' it's ripe
How cats is stuck in purgatory for life
Tryin' to fight the enemy without sight
They in the dark swingin' right to left
Clingin' to the little bit of light that's left
And can't escape the room, you can't escape the tomb
You all wear a mask sometimes, I can relate to Doom
That make the whole world earthquake, shake, and move
The beat create a mood or eat your whole plate of food
You can't come close like an order of protection
That this is myself in the pack was sort of my intention
Slaughter anybody testin' my callin', my profession
Anymore questions will born 'em a lesson
A demonstration of takin' it all the way home
While you stuck at first base and
It's like havin' relations without the penetration
Basically doin' nathin'
You a waste of space and time
Always chasin' mine is how you lost your place in line

To catch you with the combo, boom boom, Muhammad Ali
Versus Potsy cursin' Yahtzee at the crap table
Burstin' caps at a Nazi rap label
Oops, a pot of hot tea spilt on the cable
Evaporate an ice grill, read the seeds of Aesop fable
Children, come sit, gather
Face the rapid fire of the super slap shit outta liar
The end
Villain, the champ tramp
Flowin' since they had him holdin' ???
He cleaned his mask with a shoe mitt
And a little bit of her blue spit
She told him you so stupid
Wiped it off, got dressed and left
Everybody instigatin', not just the ref
We can shoot the fire on the dirt ground
Rocks out live with the worst sound

I say demise of the music business cause people always gonna need music in they life
You know what I'm saying
I can't do music with people I'm uncomfortable with
You know what I'm saying
I can't be on stage with you pouring out my soul if I don't like you
So with said shout out to Strong Arm Steady
Shout out to Jean Grae
That's my Blacksmith family you dig
I just heard a song that reminded me of times when you were finding me
Rhyming in Greenwich Village circa 1993
Yeah those were the salad days my careers appetizing
The main course a casserole a jambalaya
Different influences that led me where the music is
A student is only as good as his teachers tutelage
Paying for college and not learning was straight foolishness
So I stopped going to school but this
Hard to tell my parents how to now try to get through to them
Thought of no one daily and traveled to different places
Freestyled with Clef and Forte in the Booga Basement
With Rubiks and JuJu on Flatbush my hood amazing
Platinum Island recording with Duro and Just Blaze
And that was right next door to Rawkus what's up Jarret and Brian relax y'all
I'm mad [?] Kendra Ross you got the soul of a Stax singer
I love how you always bring it back sister
You and Reesy making every record
I got classics with Hi-Tek and Mos Def that are so respected
Shout out to Corey Smith shout out to Dave Chapelle
I went on tour with The Roots they played so well
Writing rhymes with Mike and Nine me and Pharoahe Monch were Soundbombing
Me and Lonnie Lynn got a lot in Common
Mystic Journyman introduced me to Top Ramen
On the bus Kanye West would never stop rhyming
Ain't no mountain high enough for him he never stopped climbing
That's why when the homies win I never stop smiling
See I'm smiling right now
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt that's how its gotta be
This is my odyssey its just the god in me
Yup they all a part of me
'Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
That's right and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up it's like you all my fam
Like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
It started with a blast now I'm a iconoclast
Promise to be honest in my craft and make the promise last
I do this for myself but the song for you
Once I put it out for sale then it belong to you
This for Amani Fela plus Diani Eshe
Your daddy love his girl your mother never far away
This is for Eque this for Kierra Paul
We wanna ride like Ciara and we will never fall
Headquarters and Guru is love forever y'all
Make it plain 'cause it's too strong for a metaphor
Simile your legacy will always be remembered for forever or
Till the end of time whichever come first
Big love to my mom and dad you could have done worst
Jamal and I the way we are cause you put your sons first
Many black parents lose they son to the gun burst
Mommas drowning in they own tears till they lungs burst
Voice cracking like Michael Stipe cause everyone hurts
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt that's how its gotta be
This is my odyssey its just the god in me
Yup they all a part of me
'Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
That's right and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up it's like you all my fam
Like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
My first record was with Mood back in '96
In fact it was pretty fresh Google that find that shit
It sound good I was showing you what timeless is
You couldn't catch what I was saying without rewinding it
Believe me every fan is special
You hear me now but I got fans from Lyricist Lounge and ""Manifesto""
So much wack rap I know its hard to tell
The difference but when I heat it up I make the garbage smell
I'm resurrected but I'm no savior
I know the game I can ball a little bit I'm an OK Player
Double meaning cause the flow is layered
We love to say it but its easier than it sound to ignore the haters
To snap back like the jaws of gators

But that hardly works cause y'all still ask for prices from
The waiters and you're hardly served
You pay once, you pay forever, that you can't reverse
That's why I ain't paid Talib for no fuckin' verse
Mutual respect over below payments
Your mind accepted marriage when money proposed slavery
I been listenin' and four quarters of y'all won't make it
I'm Africa's number one, that's a fuckin' bold statement
And I'm the most relevant
You failin' to admit that is your biggest impediment
We're not on the same level man
Your dream girl sent me nudes and I'm checkin' 'em
Underneath the table as I'm havin' dinner with the president
Man fuck the money

My taste expensive as a superstar
So I take what I want like a coup d'état
From profit sharing to profiteering
Now they stop and stare 'cause we cop McLarens
But we not preparing for God's appearance
Too busy dominating and domineering
Our competition securin' our position
Now our greed dangerous as a heart condition
Rap niggas lie like politicians
So I gotta tell the truth, that's a smart decision
Capitalism is a cataclysm
If white collar crime is a bad decision
Then the makers who routinely crash the system
Would quickly get they asses dragged to prison
Need money to eat, need money to live
Need money to keep, need money to give
But when pursuit of the money is your only goal
Then you lose control, then you lose your soul
Dollars and cents to rob our children of their innocence
So when it's sent, we come to our nation's capital to cash the check
According to Dr. King when he saw it clear in his dream
""We built the pyramids, they built a pyramid scheme""

Black magic in the hood, its tragic but understood
Crack addicts, crack windows, crack wood

We have to express the part of ourselves that make us want to martyr ourselves

Effected by the deficit, times and lessons get hard
Either get by or get god, but but you try to get by

If I don't look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
Naturally that's confusion to a young'n trying to follow Christ
Taught that if you don't know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
Who was King James?
And why did he think it was so vital to remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
And they say that's where you go when you die but how they know
It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
I've been to many churches I've quoted many verses
I've dealt with my base self I controlled my many urges
I used to study my lessons
It was a blessing not a curse
I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth, word 
Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads that Hell is called Babylon
And that's where them crazy boarheads dwell
They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan.
So it all sound the same to me
That's why when they say one is right and the other is wrong it just sound like game to me
It's like God skipped past the church and came to me
No that ain't vein to me
It's just a particular way that I came to see
The difference between those who claim to be 
Religious and those that say they spiritual
And recognizing that life is full of miracles
You could see my glow in a rhyme
The poem divine 'cause it coincide with a grow in the time that those who looking for God knowin' to go inside
It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup
Yo, living in mass confusion
Looking for absolution
The gas-inducing psychopath produce the last solution
Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satan
Religion create the vision
Make the Muslim hate the Christian
Make the Christian hate the Jew
Make the rules of faith 
That you condition to and to you gotta follow
And God forbid you go to Hell
But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well
We in the third eye of the storm
It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
It's all going to (Hell)
Yup, we living in (Hell)
Yup, they giving us (Hell)
The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Just because the lord is my shepherd don't mean I gotta be no sheep
You feel me?
More blood is spilled over religion than anything in world history
We saying the same thing"

Homie swing you better +duck+ like Aflac
Lames just, stay in your lane, the flow is HazMat
(Phil Da Agony)
Yeah, we back for the '07, say goodbye to this '06 shit
Yeah we here for the championship
And that's exactly what we came to get
You know the name of this, organization that made you famous
It's the Strong Arm, with the long arm to throw the bomb on
The drop of the dime; we at the top of the line
Plus we on the incline, the rhymes be finer than wine
Design them in the mind, they shine like diamonds
Fresh out the coal mine, young soul, old mind
I'ma hold mine, Steady spittin' cold lines
Sharpen it up, backwoods sparkin it up
These niggaz act like, what I rap like in the clutch
I mastered the dutch, Dizzle tell 'em to duck
Hitman for hire, Blacksmith put it up
Courtesy of Kweli, you got a problem with me
Phil Da Agony, Strong Arm Steady!
(Chorus: Talib Kweli)
We 'bout to open up, we 'bout to sew it up
We so focused bruh, go on and throw it up
The joint is broken up, we 'bout to roll it up
We 'bout to smoke it up, that's why they wanna go with us
Who wanna go with us? She wanna go with us
She wanna go with us, they wana go with us
So let's gooo!

From L.A. to B.K., Brooklyn that is
On the black hand side, Strong Arm Steady
(Mitchy Slick)
Blacksmith and we hear somethin'
Next thing you know, we was on the road dime humpin
Earrings full of O'Shea's
Big ass chain all in the way like Ghostface
Of course all the hoes wanna go
Baby like Mitchy, hella ghetto but he heavy peddles Lambo's
And gettin' snow cheap
Had a nigga out missin' studio sessions, haulin from the police
But now I'm focused, and where my folks is
And when we together we mob like locusts
Crooks that hit licks that got crooks who work in big ass granny kitchens
That we use to cook chickens
And not the ones that's finger lickin'
The ones that'll have a Cali nigga ticklin switches
My guns'll make a Northern Cali run
How you think the little homie got kush zips for four hun'?
(Krondon)
Ay don't think we changed our style
We just got more change for our style
Strong Arm Steady!
Chronic, country as cornbread, this L.A. life could be
Funky as George Clinton's colorful dreads, prestigious
I'm bred from a different cloth
The walk and talk soft could cost your head
The difference you the minor we the major
No long life to be lived for the hater or the traitor
Eight out of nine of my niggaz doin' time for advancin
Handlin illegal finances
This the family reunion, mixed with the holy communion
You'll never win, you're too busy consumin
Kweli, let's start up a union
Protect the real niggaz from the fakes so we ain't gotta do 'em
Yeah, this the church right across from the liquor sto'
Been on that hip-hop shit since Biz Mark' picked his nose
Under the mattress stack big as a fat chick
Steady is the gang and the label is Blacksmith, bitch!

Fuck the harder way, we doing it the smarter way
To my god I pray, that's how I start my day
The bullets start to spray the revolution starts today
You say you never scared there's kids in other countries
Making jerseys, jeans, and sneakers they could never wear
Parents never there, they're busy building homes they can't afford to buy
Cars they can't afford to drive
Working jobs that don't support their life
You busy screaming gangsta, gangsta all that talk is trife
You already lost the fight if you don't know the cost of life
These kids is forced to fight a war they can't outrun
Ain't got no shoes but got a gun
Now where the fuck he pulled that out from?
People ask me how we wearing diamonds
When there's little kids in Sierra Leone
Losing arms for crying while they mining
Probably an orphan who's momma died of AIDS
He built a coffin working often but he never paid
Forever slaving in the world that's forever cold
Becoming the man of the house at 11 years old
This reality rap, I get inside the mentality that...
Terrorize you like a cowardly act (c'mon)

The bullets start to spray the revolution starts today
I was sold to a sick European by a rich African battlin'
Middle Passages, I can't go back again
Battlin' years of denied history, lies and mysteries
Wives with misty eyes watchin' their husbands be beaten viciously
Battle in the wilderness of North America
Run by the river, only stoppin' to pray chased by predators
Terrorists with etiquette who vote and kill their president
Their capacity for evil so evident and prevalent
Ain't no hesitation involved, a nation dissolved
While we sit back waitin' to evolve
Those who would trade in their freedom
For their protection deserve neither
Not a name, not tradition
Religion, you learn Jesus
Turn the other cheek
Inherit the Earth, just stay meek
Fuck the way you speak
Try to run, we chop off your feet
Fast forward to 2004 we selling
Yo this ain't what I'm settling for
I want more, yo

Swooping the industry, like a bird to prey
My stance has got stamina, ya verses lack vertebrae
I heard them say I was a conscious rapper
But I'm a monster when I hafta smack the shit out of a nonsense actor
Using my 'hands solo' and I don't need chewy
Over your head like Yamakas and Koofies yo
Fuck the screen gems y'all niggaz act in B movies
Type of niggaz proud to be groupies
Followers in the herd running over the cliff
I'm the +Buffalo Soldier+, smoke ya like a dread like rasta

How many niggaz think that gats make the weaker strong
Can't do for self and wanna snatch the plate you eating on
That don't take heart, slave, nigga play ya part

And dig a proper ditch, you lying like a politician
Your proposition meets opposition like contradictions
Get out my house, you ain't no real representative

So yeah I'm positive, I'm positive I'm the best

And you will need to find your passion. Many of you have already done it, many of you will later, many of you may take to your thirties or forties, but don't give up on finding it. Right, because then all you are doing is waiting for the reaper. Find your passion and follow it. And if there is anything I have learned in my life, you will not find that passion in things. And you will not find that passion in money. Because the more things and the more money you have, the more you will just look around and use that as the metric - and there will always be someone with more
Who I be is the super MC, run up on a group of MCs
Rappin' all rudimentary, like stupid MD
Head of Valley girls full of jealousy
But I see through the envy
I be shootin' for the stars, never shootin' the breeze
When you chase what you want, you run past what you need
Hear the call of the Lord, start fallin' to your knees
And the families be immortal like the dew on the leaves
Yup, every rhyme got a reason
You need me like your mama need Jesus
Murder rap from the words that I rap
Treatin' rappers like celebrity news, got 'em leakin'
Malcolm said I may complain so the deep shit
Is spoon fed to you with the flow if you're peepin'
So wavy with the flow, got 'em seasick
Acquirin' miles, wanna know what's the secret
They all devil worship except the reverend
You keep makin' that excuse but remember this
You feel better 'bout your own failure
When you think success is based on Illuminati membership
Fuck the money, that's my new fuckin' attitude
This the Earth, wind and fire, this gratitude
Whether in paradise or ghetto avenues
I stay inspired by my longitude and latitude
Recordin' in the rainforest in Puerto Rico
Climbin' up the Dunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios
Joey made this beat in the Trump Tower
Fire like gunpowder, finna light it up cause the blunt's sour
Revolutionary People's Party
Evolutionary, we so godly
Still at the strip club with Nico
When he pull his hair back, we call him Nico Suave
We the people's champ like my top of the year tour
From K Valentine to jessica Care moore
Nico Is to fuckin' with Cory Mo
GQ, Rapsody to Hi-Lo
This the good ship [?], Jamla the damn squad
Colors of the color to toast in the dancehall
They call me the solution to problem I can't solve
So get off that bullshit and get on your damn job
Get on your job, nigga
Get on your job, nigga
Get on your job, nigga
Come on
We be workin' damn hard
We pullin' the damn cards like you're puttin' your hands up
We're stand up individuals
Fuck respectability, we ain't pullin' our pants up
We plugged in the lamppost, never duckin' no damn folks
We ain't bucking like Sambo's, to fuck with our damn clothes
Hoes fascinated by the fashion statement
Yet you masqueradin' as a rap crusader
I know you a hater, player
I'm concentrated on the facts and data
That-a-way I've been my favorite
Till there's no debatin' who's the greatest rapper
Always ready for the battle, no fear factor
RIP PH, we shed a tear after hearin' that we lost a gladiator
What a real rapper
Spittin' bars in the cypher in the hereafter
I'm in artist mode
Writer then before, I'm a writer at the core
But let me get it off on stage and I prove
That I'm tighter than a moor, invite him to the war
The truth about trust is
We motivated by the rewards, no one's above this
So by that logic we're monsters in the makin'
And seekin' justice is really self-preservation and
You don't trust what you can't see?
You don't trust what you can't touch?
Then how do you explain love?
You don't trust what you can't see?
You don't trust what you can't touch?
Then how do you explain love?

Watch me flip it like the Blacksmith logo
I shine a light through the darkness when the night is black as Yaphet Kotto
All these rappers looking mad in photos
Saddest player braggadocio quality make up for what a lack a promo
You say you blast a fo-fo you don't shoot
More like you shot me an email but forgot to attach the vocals
Call 'em a bastard like their dad a no show
I'm too fast for slow pokes running on the track with Yohji Yamamoto's
This ain't fashion rap I'm bringing the passion back
Find me where the trouble at that's my natural habitat
I take it with me in the booth
To delivery or respect to the dead we only owe the truth
So if somebody feeling disrespected even when his face is smiling
His heart rate escalate to violence
Look at them tremble juggling drugs
Using abusing beautiful struggling they were usually bubbling
It's the voice of the voiceless hope for the hopeless
Spit game way to real they don't promote it
Cause the way I approach it from another angle
I stay in the streets and notice the gutter rainbows
It ain't no pot o' gold it's where the products sold
It's where we lock and load and and cop that rock then roll
So turn it up loud and turn it up now
Turn it up loud turn it up now
Welcome to my hood where the rainbows is in the gutter
The pain that you will discover is making the angels shutter
There's sex in the city but we never claimed to love her
I know you heard of us we're more murderous than Cain famous brother
Living with death smoking blunts with the Grim Reaper
Snitch niggas known to blow the whistle like a gym teacher
This gum flapper swear he a gun clapper
Nah sum'n backwards he really a dumb rapper
The trap on the corner with the oil spilling
Mixed with the dirt and the water collected in the gutter till the colors brilliant
I paint pictures so legendary
I been doing this your history is as short as the month of February
In a leap year what do we fear
Dead bodies lying on the ground nothing to see here
Be clear don't ever cross me like police lines
Cause libertarians will be not invited to tea time

Turn it up loud turn it up now
Saw that [?] whip around a building to form a corner tornado
Finding nature in the city we cover our feet in gators
Bugatti's to bodegas they selling rotten tomatoes
Stacking chips and I don't mean potato there go another one
Graduated from quarter waters and Butter Crunch
Tuxedo nice with a gun tucked in his cummerbund
He get it from his mama he ain't nothing but his mother's son
She used to get it popping like bubblegum
Peddling poison was often better employment
The ghetto destroying any sense of self she was enjoying
Survival of the fittest by any means necessary
Got us calling drug dealers revolutionaries
You say he kill his people he say I feed my family
And you ain't kickin in you'll never understand me
You just stand in my way now you an obstacle
And obstacles end up in the hospital
It's the voice of the voiceless hope for the hopeless
Spit game way to real they don't promote it
Cause the way I approach it from another angle
I stay in the streets and notice the gutter rainbows
It ain't no pot o' gold it's where the products sold
It's where we lock and load and and cop that rock then roll
So turn it up loud and turn it up now
Turn it up loud turn it up now

You see me, and I'm a beamie, uh
First, I'm sayin' hi, then I'm wavin bye-bye
We get in, we get in
Girl, you're so fly, you're so fly
Yo, these swallows is horny like charley parker
Be cutting 'em 'cause I'm studying these birds like ornithology
Follow 'em when they tweeting, holler instead of speaking
Give it a name, she played the wicked games every weekend
Broke up with a dude for almost ending a life
Came over for a closure, ended up spending the night
That cosy in this apartment, wine bottles started popping
Put scratches up on his back, they question him where he got them
Forgot it was her, she threaded him, fingers was like machetes
The fucking was so static, she shaded him like a faddic
Every single chick, she's like enough already
I need to be with someone else, this stuff is so petty
She once reacted to things he did in the past
Thinking it was no safe, he couldn't say no to the ask
The heavy so rash, she gave up all her power
He boarded out on the street, nowhere to live, nowhere to shower
How she gonna make it through the night?
How she's so accepting all this tension in her life?
She always carrying a baby with her
Her spitting image just like looking at her baby pictures
Afraid to say 'cause she dependent on man for real
How she running these streets but always standing still
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
How she running the streets but still standing still
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
Battery in the back, popping up with the cop
Top popular with the acid, the hot attack
Niggas whooping the holla out the drama
The way she passing the barber shop
Only job that's an option mcdonalds or telemarket
Often her asking together, this ain't the beatles
She need is a man like she going under needle
She doing so much cotton, it's a wonder she living
The money was so seductive, no wonder she ain't leaving
First time she fell like a woman was when a dude screamed
Nice ass out the car window driving past
Nobody showed her how to live so all she do is dream
They call her rocket cause the make-up is like the mash-bomb
Scars proeminently large on her frontal lobe
Behind bars for credit cards scheme she pulled a month ago
First she getting high, now we waving bye-bye
She's waiting out the station
Just the same as she's waiting out the station
Late at night for a train that never came
She always carrying a baby with her
Her spitting image just like looking at her baby pictures
Afraid to say 'cause she dependent on man for real
How she running these streets but always standing still
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
How she running the streets but still standing still
She need to get up off the hamster wheel
She need to get up off the hamster wheel"
42,Happy Home,2007,Liberation (2007),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"I'm feelin' free, let's go
This, ha - ppy home [x4]
Back in the day when the bus was less than three quarters
Lloyd met Beverly and took her out to Sweet Waters
""Boy what a looker"" he thought, ""Let me court her""
He musta been a playa 'cause she popped out three daughters
Brenda the oldest by herself for a little while
That's till Joanne showed up she was the middle child
Then came Loretta next she was a little wild
Beverly was fly so her daughters had a little style
Brenda the first in the family to go to college
The dreams of being properly addressed as doctor
Insert the name of the man who gonna sweep her off her feet
In a heartbeat sharper than shark's teeth
Just 'cause a brother say he love you don't make it so
So when she was lookin' for suitors she had to take it slow
Someone to run fingers through her Angela Davis 'fro
And dedicate herself to like songs on the radio
The ratio of black men to black woman at this college is preposterous
If you a scholar you already know
So she decided she should focus on her studies
She couldn't have boyfriends, she could have buddies
When she get out on her own she can bring men home
But there was one in particular breakin' out the friend zone
It's déjà vu the way this came to me
And it explain how I came to be
I'm from
Yeah
Back in the days it was hard for black actors
They had to lighten they skin with makeup like Max Factor
My grandfather Stan wasn't (Nothin' But a Man)
He fell in love with Jivote so he took her by the hand
They had two sons, Stanley and Perry
They go together like Brandy and Sherry or Coke and Mary and Barry
Simply put they don't always get along
They used to travel as a family doing shows singing songs
But this was through the Segregated South
And before someone got punched in they segregated mouth, Perry was out
Livin' like a hippie in the sixties, Pop's chillin'
Headin' to The Village to see Bob Dylan, when he was top billin'
But Perry was not feelin' complete, he had to get on his feet
He said, ""God willin', I can get into this school, that's smarter for real
Plus I got this draft card in the mail""
The champ said, ""I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong""
Momma leanin them 'cause[?] they shootin' blacks, faggots, and Catholics
People bleedin' on TV is so tragic
Creatin' the catalyst for the people to get active
Got into NYU and took classes
The world was changing he knew he couldn't look past this
Who knew goin' to school would make him want to give his name to a girl
And have children that would change the world
Back in the day we used to barbeque a little beach
Bit up 'cause I got the sweet blood that mosquitoes eat
My cousin Warren used to hook up the speakers each Fourth of July
We can meet and my people be listening to 'BLS, KISS FM Mastermix
Some dopes pass the fifth we watchin' fireworks after this
Momma bought the biscuits, everything is all delicious as usual
It's beautiful we all can kick it
Touch football we get in the huddle and the twins steady get into trouble
Me and Lebema[?] blowin' the bubbles, little Lloyd such a happy little boy
It can rain, it can pour, ain't nothin' gonna kill his joy
Jamal playing in the pool or well playin' it cool
Times is hard but we makin' it through
I'm taking you through the scene of the family reu'
The family tree no matter what I'm standin' with you
Insanity? Please, jail time, death is trouble
Through the stress and the mess and to Der[?] I love you
I go out in the world and represent the family name
It used to hang on people from a tree like a candy cane
Now I'm standing on the shoulders of my ancestors
And I'm throwing up the sign of the times like hand gestures
And no matter, where in the world, in Rome I get the money and always bring it back to"

Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care
A cautionary tale
I heard about this new artist
Somebody said he was the hardest
Seem like I gotta do the knowledge
'Cause I don't go by those comments
Loving the promise of some new hot shit
And apparently this kid got it
He adored by all of them bloggers
They describe him down to his boxers
I heard last night he had problems
With some other random ass nigga
Tonight the blog is on fire
Them niggas beefing on twitter
His timeline full of depression
But his death the life of the party
They celebrating his self destruction
It make for excellent copy
All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care
The life a series of moments
And VIP he be posting
Dudes be drinking that potion
Girls all in they emotion
Thorough breads in the stable, what
Pills on his table, what
I heard he staying independent
He don't fuck with major labels
The rumors keep on swirling
Every interview is a circus
Yeah he grinding, he working
But his lack of god is disturbing
Can't wait to write about how the drugs to blame
He was numbing the pain, he was loving the fame
Plus think he going out with what's her name
With an ass so fat she won't fuck with lames
All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care
Heard your baby mama got crazy drama
Get way too violent and drunk
Couldn't make an honest woman out of her
Now he face your honor every month
Now she slandering niggas on instagram
So her followers up and her kids be down
She be giving out advice how to get a man
On the sex tape part of a business plan
Now she coming out next to plug
A new song she gets on the breakfast club
Where party promoters give extra love
All the hypebeasts saying sit next to us
I heard a bunch of these rumors
I heard it made this nigga lose it
Only thing I have yet to hear
Is any of dude music
All the he said she said
Don't even care
All the he said she said
Don't even care"

African blood race through my vein
You can hear it in my name
And you can feel it in my game
I'm sayin' the streets is drama
Make me wanna rock my body armor
Still I'm probably calmer
Than your average Dalai Lama
I use the meditation, I stay patient
But I never deal with hesitation
I'm way blunted yo, I can give a what
If your favorite stations feelin' me
These rap cats are killin' me
No type of stability
My ability got more cats in New York
Running than Hilary
We be chillin', where the blood be spillin
We got the red badge of courage for bravery
Me and my man Teodross Avery
Blow away the legacy of slavery
Through any phone, sax or a micro
Hotter than a light show with the pyro-techniques

Respected in the world where people faker than prosthetics
Stay true to a certain aesthetic
Protect it like the hip-hop secret service
Cat off top lookin' nervous
Wondering when we gonna set it
Anticipation will kill you if you let it in your aura
Reflect it like god's face upon the water
You can't lead a man to water
Like you can a lamb to slaughter
So I concentrate on me so I can
Keep my plans in order
I clutch like King Cobra
I rock while y'all boulder
Chop emcees up, put 'em in the grinder
Like farmer of Dakota
'Cause I'm colder than a polar
Walk, talk and stand on my ancestors shoulders
Told you we at wear like sista soldier
Battle tactics, spray wars
Like gat clips, full metal jackets
That hit, BAW!
Got you lookin' acrobatic doing back flips
Even if the track skips,
We improv like Jazz Artists
Freestyle, hop back on the beat
And rock regardless
I'm saying, y'all with me tonight?
I'll travel at the speed of light
When I see the mic, I get this on lock
'Cause my song is in the key of life
I roll with my ????
'Cause we be alike
Consider them family
Make sure they all eating right
See the plan is to feed the fam
Then free the land, before I get old
I can't be young forever like Peter Pan
Cats pale in comparison
So bad they need a tan
Barely see they hand
Craft they face like a seed of sand
See the ??? you got to beat the man
Understand I'm saying
The writing on the wall like a paint can
Spraying graffiti on your soul
Music completely make me whole
I'm saying, trying to keep my
Pockets on swoll
To give back to the community
Make a future for you and me
From my birth certificate to my eulogy
Usually in Brooklyn
But my mind keep it movin
Ain't no mystery

45,High Life,2013,Prisoner Of Conscious (2013),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"This the high life
Call it my life
(Rubix)
This is the byproduct of beautiful love
Fit like a glove, what's good, my people I think we could
Get it you know we should, hold it like it's a grudge submerged
But I just surf
(Talib Kweli)
I'm renting the universe
But the stars don't fit and my bars are too mega
Is the fruit of my labor, my plate is full of color
Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker
(Rubix)
Moon raker, sun scraper, will give you fire for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors
Sire of the flavor, designer of the caper
Executive executor direct when I'm on path
Flight without navigator, plight of a savior
(Talib Kweli)
Now what would Jesus do?
How you believe in Him? You don't believe in you
The idea that you doubting I'm unbeatable
Vizzini in the princess bride - inconthievable
These MCs is eatable, wait - edible
I'm fishing with dynamite, now I got a freezer full
Of rappers, bastards I'm ten steps ahead of you
Incredible, give credit where credit due
(Rubix)
Put passion into action
Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing
Accelerate, generate, power with my pen and pape'
Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate
(Talib Kweli)
We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate
You imitate, your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it, never gonna say they love what we doing on stage
Even if they don't one quote and the hate just integrates
(Rubix)
They feel us like shade, you know we're feeling great
Not a script that is writ', this is how originals spit
It's an unconventional gift, kwe we interpolate
Them others be herbin' it, the praise, we deserving it
(Talib Kweli)
Word, I love songs, writing to right wrongs
Continue to fight on, I'm putting the gloves on
I love horns, I'm loving this damn track
I'm loving the hand clap, it's the clap, clap
Loving it when you listen
""Love will fix it"" said Ashford and Simpson (That's right)
Living for the drums and the slums, some of the best parts
The tourists never come, they run when it gets dark
(Rubix)
Yeah, so in my idle space, they're funny like them bridal maids
Booking like we're playing spades, yeah, we always make the grade
FSC to get a fade, Valencia then to the Haight
Sucka free I'm in my space, say I'm hella steezy, yeah (yee)
Believe I get a so in, streaking like a Martin
Sunny in Dolores, bike parking
Fly chick's sparking
Then we up the road to the Phoenix some steady bar hopping
There's high life everywhere, Tony Allen rhythm is
Pattern that we living in, Kweli on his business
Everywhere we deep in this, shawty's gon' be speaking it
Oh, they so uniquely spit
(Talib Kweli)
The great debater, the saviour, the caped crusader
The alpha, the omega, your favorite communicator
News junky I'm debunking the myth of the job creators
Departed the conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty, I'm bringing it as my nudey
You drinking it like a smoothie, they're spinning it like a sufi
Rappers, I dissect 'em, collecting 'em like a souvie
Near they're acting up I'm directing 'em like a movie
Skip the drama, this an action-adventure
They so freaking soft it should be against the law
Illegal tender
And yo, do I really need to mention
This is the high life
High life, high life
High life, high life
'Cause we be living the high life, high life
High life, high life
Yes, I'm living in the high life, high life
High life, high life
'Cause I'm living the high life, high life"

They're still cheering like I'm all that's left
The air is toxic when you draw your breath
Resurrect the music, I'm snatching it from claws of death
Vital signs are improving, I make 'em lay down
An idle mind is usually described as the devil's playground
My rep established I'm rapping just for the sport of it
Been nice for a career, you're just barely grasping the thought of it
Indebted to the hood like a RushCard
Supporter like push-up bras and lumbars
Except I'm never sitting, I'm ever-living like Mummm-Ra, I'm the sun god
Smart as a whip, but forever rippin it dumb-hard
I see you fronting with your dollar-store shades on
Faker than abs that's sprayed-on, artificial as Rayon
My rhyme is satisfying your Quest for Fire like Rae Dawn
Chung when I'm forming like Voltron I'm, yung Raekwon
Mix in a bit of KRS-One and Q-tip
Rakim, some of that Ice Cube. Now who's this?
No one as gifted as this, so magnificent
Classically consistent, I'm nasty as black licorice
Coldest, but I get the room hotter than bikram yoga
You seen the show, you know I make the people move like an eviction notice
I'm focused. I'm Moses when the mic is on
That's why these rappers scatter like roaches when the light is on
Hold it now, I hold it down
I'm staying where I'm at, you better go around
You know the voice and you know the sound
I rip the microphone and then I throw it down
Hold it now, I hold it down
I'm staying where I'm at, you better go around

Ill give intimate details so you can get to know me,
These corporate rapers like why this dude pickin' on me
You rap your way to the top but now its gettin' lonely,
Kids is hungry and you lookin' like steak from nick and tony's
But don't nobody want your jewels cause ya shit is phony
Say word yo shit is real, yo shit is corny,
Rhymes turn a new page like mark foley
And touch kids like when larry clark gave the part to chloe,
Rest in peace to Harold Hunter, the greatest from New York
Who started out skating for Zoo York, word
Hangin' out at the gavin, I was very lucky
The talk to rash once I got past Darren Dudley,
Got him on respiration that's pre-Badu
Bet you Garnett Reid got a Matt Doo tattoo,
Some times it feels like I'm drowning I gotta tread water
Head above the water I always remember headquarters
Heads up eyes open I got my mind focused
I find hope inside a line, my rhymes defines opus
Sometimes hopeless people fill my soul with evil
My record so hard it broke the needle,
At the mixtape awards niggas act like they don't give a fuck though
Disrespect the legacy of Justo
What the blood clot? no, let the blood flow
You ain't come to pay your respect then what you come fo,
Too many good niggas die, it's like a stop loss
Good niggas ghetto like fried wings and hot sauce,
How you hard the cops lettin 50 shots off
Baby jay-z's with the knock off Scott Storch
Beat you are not Short you are not Katt
You not a playa or a pimp money stop that,
Learn to masta your speech and be eloquent
Rappers keep peddlin sweets the beats weaker than gelatin,
We used to kick 'em dust and now we settling
Rest to peace to Dilla, Weldon we can't forget you
Professor x and proof we miss you word,

And what the people want? Please deliver us
And what the people need? Hey
I got that, yeah
I call these rappers baby seals, 'cause they club you to death
I could call em' Navy SEALs, 'cause they government feds
What become of the vets? They drugged up, they fucked up, they in debt
There ain't no love and no respect, it's like a gang, it's like a club or a set
Hip hop's the new WWF
What do you rap or do you wrestle? Niggas love to forget
We got till it's gone, you think you on, you still hustlin' backwards
Your topical norm a tropical storm, it's a fuckin' disaster
Back to the topic we on, it all started at Rawkus
They couldn't find the words to describe me so they resort to the shortcuts
Is he a backpacker? Is he a mad rapper?
An entertainer or the author of the last chapter
We living in these times of love and cholera
Synonymous with the apocalypse, look up the clouds is ominous
We got maybe ten years left say meteorologists, shit
We still waitin' for the Congress to acknowledge this

You can't always just borrow and asks for favors, bruh
Stand on your own two, never covet thy neighbor's stuff
Karma's a bitch so watch your mouth and what you sayin', bruh
I start a conversation based on general observation
Hip hop is not a nation, take it to population
Niggas got a lot to say when locked inside the belly of Satan
Awaitin' trial, debatin' how the hell I got placed in this system
Am I a victim or just a product of indoctrination?
They exploit it and use me like a movie with product placement
You hear the congregation - this is the hostile gospel
The truth is hard to swallow, it'll leave you scarred tomorrow
""Keep it honest"" - our motto, these niggas keep it bottled
I'm the writer who reach the fighters like speeches by 'Cause D'Amato
DJs stickin' to vinyl like ""fuck Serato""
Suppliers who ride around the block in the custom models
Ballin' like the struck the lotto, you know who the cleanest is
A nigga keep it rich with the stitch and Greedy Geniuses
I'm not a hipster, but I flip it like a sneaker pimp
Expose the game, treat it like a bitch
Smack fire out these hoes, 'cause they snitch
And tap wires while I plead the fifth, you can't trust a soul in the biz
So be careful who you eatin' with and sleepin' with' and also who you chiefin' with
You never know, they might've added in secret ingredients

Just keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood
Your words rung hollow, we need someone to follow
Freedom's a road that's seldom traveled, watch hell unravel
Right before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle
The single mother who raised her daughter to bear the sacred water
And not take the hand of every man who make an offer
To black kids wishin' they white kids when they close they eyelids
Like ""I bet they neighborhood ain't like this""
White kids wishin' they black kids, and wanna talk like rappers
It's all backwards, it's identity crisis
The industry inside us is vipers with fangs trying to bite us
Drug suppliers is the health care providers
We cakin' makin' narcotics outta household products
We ain't workin' out till we exorcise the demons that's inside us
Plus they seem to just provide us with enough rope to hang ourselves
Enough dope to slang ourselves, enough toast to bang ourselves
It's officially nigga season, these niggas is bleedin'
That's why I'm spittin' freedom, we had enough of trigger squeezin'
People wanna live it up, please deliver us
We wanna live it up, please deliver us
Th-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel
I'm reaching through the fire - please deliver us

It's pitiful how we becomin slaves to things that we own
They en-slavin the brains with the whips and the chains
End up in the coffin chasing the fortune, chasing the fame
Slave to the rhythm, slave to the night, slave to the day
They hop aboard the Underground Railroad and run away

And look around and see, don't be acting blind
This is the birthing of us, it's just not kind
Now what's the worst thing a man could ever price
Pay his life for something he didn't do like the missing mice
Listen up, you know growing up I'll tell you something
He won't like you in the deepest of dungeon

I give my son some advice
Eyes on the prize, keep more with the one in your sight
Won't win the gunfight if you brung you a knife
I'm drawin blood from the rock and keep floodin the block
With rhymes that are sharper than the razor that be cuttin' the box
For sure I gotta move niggas with rocks in their socks
The prostitutes sellin the shit right in front of the cops
Under the street lamp, walking through the rain until our feet damp
Single moms all line at the office because they need stamps
Your cousin out of jail, he spent his time finding God
With a felony kinda charge it's kinda hard to find a job
He gotta make a decision, the situation he's placed in
As he's gotta get that gainful employment for his probation
Otherwise he's just another part of the scenery
Just because you got out of jail, that don't mean you free
(Talib Kweli {Sizzla})
{Deliver me oh my father}
What? What?
Deliver me from the evil that's all around me
Jamaica to King's County, God
{Deliver me oh my father}
Gotta survive and sustain and that ain't right
And everywhere you go they want to give you a fight
Gotta survive and sustain and that's for sure
And every minute sees I'm coming at the bar
Oh yeah...
I got to reach out and look
And keep my seed by my side
Uh, yeah
Life's a reality

Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me
(Talib Kweli)
When are we gonna grow up?
Why do I love you so much we so touched?
Excited by the drama we like when it show up
The fightin don't slow up, I light you like close ups
And I call you my Calamity Jane, you like my fantasy
Love cause the same chemical reaction in the brain as insanity
Holidays drinkin' wit'cha family... passionate folks
Imagine if they had they own reality show - actually no
Desire's like fire; quit playin' or get burned
Or give it away on camera like Montana Fishburne
Our presence is a gift, a gift is our present
Breakup text call her a bitch under my breath
And then the makeup sex she forgive me in a session
I know she love me, she sendin a mixed message though

Me and you we considered the upper echelon
The only one I come out my fitted for in a restaurant
You can get it huh; remember I was takin' your digits
Same night I was makin' the visit
Make it the mission to make you cum
When we done sometimes you hate to admit it
You a little numb from the toys
And love the noise that you make when you run from the boys
And comfort your man, insane how we go so crazy with it
This the asylum, so we call relationships committed
You ain't a bird I ain't them others guys that get lost in the name
You the butterfly, and I'm the moth to your flame
Love is dying while the mother's cryin
Big brother eyein me imposin their reality to Shutter Island

Our love is like a Psycho or a trilogy, the drama is killin' me
I'm grown but the little boy is still in me
We discuss monogamy polygamy, the I's the probability
Your momma ain't feelin' me, it stung like a killer bee
How far from the tree do the apple fall?
The things I said - was it how I felt, was it the alcohol?
Or do I really hate her after all?
I apologize for the statements that I made to her
First I swallowed my pride, then I ate my words
I tried to pass it off acted like it was nothin'
The fact is I was discoverin my appetite for destruction
Everything else is bland once you tasted filet mignon
When I'm full I'm takin' you home, you a plate for later on
I'll eat it up... or beat it up
Till your love runneth over, yo I need a cup

Who graduated from stabbing and grabbing a biscuit
It's sick and tragic how antagonistic we get
When it's no power go sour
I seen him crossing a bridge by the masses
Covered in the ashes of both towers
Made it in New York and the way that we talk
Make it to North and that's a gift
Refuse to back, lay to mourn, and then tore it over
Look out for shooters that we're popping up at the opera
The popular, adore his pain for the sins of the god father
Popular music got 'em confused with killers and artists
I kill it the hardest competition dearly departed
They feeling some sort of way 'cause my flow revealing the garbage
I'm making 'em throw it up, you just making the people vomit
When it comes to this rhymin' I'm a legend like too common
Or the Chupacabra, the way I move it together it's how I knot 'em
Make them acclaim my cover, you daquiri with the
The Amarretta, you're sweet as a girly drink
Throw it back, cognac, I'm the best, you know that
You can have your own opinion, but not your own facts
On track as the most prolific ever, the most consistently
Vicious, New York can rip you, be ripping it like a shred
Some symphony hall shit, getting higher than your faucet
Getting better, trouble pearl of your jam like Eddie Vedder
Very fed up with self appoint and preserved us with past errors
That never seen their reflection when they're walking past mirrors
They got bitten and now they're smitting with the taste of blood and ticking
They taking enough drugs for the sleeping and keeping it fucking and make it up
Raise the bar and the waiters up
Others hating, just confused, undergo the way to luck
The eyes are the window to the souls and my shades is up
Advocate for artists, regardless 'cause I got faith in us
For the worthless who don't get paid enough
Take the bus, hands way too rough for the paper cuts
As far as they're concerned from on the table on the way to love
Take a slump, feel it to raise a child, you got to raise it up
Raise it up, raise it up, raise it up, take it up, take it up"

Got searched on the plane, Arabic first name
Disturbed by the fame just like Kurt Cobain
Breath of life, kiss of death, my lips pursed the same
You flirt till she came

Daughters of the dust lookin' for a vein
Something to take in vain like the Lord's name
Put your hands together, got 'em all sayin'

More metal for beef that we don't let the law settle

America's ghettos that set up the slaughteres

Although we speak in different languages
We all pretty familiar with what anger is
Young and dangerous, ???
Get up on some gangsta shit
Guns to bang ya wit'
And we put it on records to entertain ya wit'

Our uniforms is white sneakers and white T-shirts
On top of wife beaters
We like to light reefers
The 'hood need us for rappers, just ain't the right leaders
I put a lot into it
This is my product and I gotta move it
Stop the industry but you can't stop the music
An upside down kingdom where life is just not fair (upside down kingdom)

Fear pumped into their veins to keep them from their destiny
Where would they be if you and I don't care?
I try, I try, you know I try
I try, I try, I try, you know I try
Yo, the things I'm seein' on the news is insane
A stock broker shoot his kid and throw himself in front of a train
A mother leave her baby home for two weeks all by himself
Three years old, eatin' ketchup and mustard, cryin for help
Tryin' to bring your struggle to life
The label want a song about a bubbly life

To BANG in the club through the night
When people suffer tonight

Work till we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
To get by... just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you eagles spread rumors
We survivalists, turned to consumers
To get by... just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Me and Willa raised three daughters all by herself, with no help
I think about a struggle and I find the strength in myself

They hot, like the jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Core bailed me out

Yes, welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli
Ladies...
I got you in the mood, for an interlude,
Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude,
But let's stop talkin', 'cause it's feelin' like an interview,
I know you into me, so, let me get into you,
I'm always in the mood for laughin' and lovin' and rappin' and *fuckin*, And passin the dutch and relaxin and puffin and hittin and duckin,
The rippin production, these kittens ain't muffins,
Just because we stuff 'em in the oven,
My words drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick,
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it,
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue,
Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick,
They holdin' hands with these dudes like they goin' steady,
But, one glimpse and I know they ready, you already know,
Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'
We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!
I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars,
Navigate through the truly bizarre,
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life,
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight,
I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars,
Navigate through the truly bizarre,
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life,
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight,
Kanye:
You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told y'all, oh,
Lose, eat crews like crews like soulfood,
The only producer that feel like ""fuck rappers!""
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers,
Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker,
So if he say nigger, then I'ma say *cracker*,
Is this the Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like, just like...
I'm the shit (Uggh)
You ain't figured out what I'm about yet,
Always rockin' that 'this ain't out yet',
But this ain't 'bout that,
From a city where niggers plug like outlets,
Far as music go yo, it ain't no outlets, so,
When I go out, niggers always out to get me in the studio,
And I ain't in the mood to flow,
I'm with my girl and I'm tryin' to hit the movies yo,
And they tryna act stupid, oh!
In the club with Silicone Suzie,
What happened to real girls like Rudy?
With real titties like Tooty,
This girl got a silicone booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now I ain't tryin' to judge like Judy,
But bitch you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like Fifty, throw her in a pool G...

Break it down
Bringin' the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum,
'Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin' in tongues
Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin' our guns
Smokin' a piff to cause a leak in your lungs,
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun,
Completely done with rap dudes - don't compete with the dumb,
I spill my blood for the people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Dante and Main Flow,
Never comin' with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bonjangles-ass dudes,
Dancin around the club, doin' the tango,
Go hard like Iverson playin' with hurt ankles,
Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!
I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars,
Navigate through the truly bizarre,
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life,
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight,
I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars,
Navigate through the truly bizarre,

56,Inner Monologue,2013,Gravitas (2013),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"Remember, whatever discipline you're in
Whether you're a musician or a photographer
A fine artist or a cartoonist, a writer, a dancer
A singer, a designer - whatever you do
You have one thing that's unique
You have the ability to make art. Sometimes life is hard
Things go wrong - in life and in love
And in business and in friendship and in health
And when things get tough, this is what you should do
Make good art
This about to be the realest shit you ever heard
I lynch rappers, got them hanging on my every word
These bitch rappers be claiming they slinging heavy word
Really snitch rappers, niggas singing like every bird
Rich rappers, nah, I don't know them niggas
Niggas don't get rich rapping, they selling clothes or liquor
My flow is sicker 'cause I flow with vigor
I'm no beginner, peep the whole agenda
Control my center 'cause I gravitate with Gravitas
This my inner monologue
Burning down your party cause our cocktails is molotov
My crime mob make you stop, lock and drop, don't get wollywop'd
Actually battery in my back like a copper top
Got it popping, started on the B-side of Body Rock
Direct to fan, I'm running my shop like my mom and pop
Modern day slavery today to be an artist, watch
They treat them like a product and try to mount like a hot 'n' tot
Molly pop, niggas not caring if they body rot
Partying like Mardi Gras, get the cream like Häagen-Dazs
Golly gosh, this is Utopia, cornucopia
I'm known to start revolts against the Romans like Zenobia
Hoping to keep coping copious amounts of opiates
Tried to start a union, but they blocked me like a Soviet
I hope they get it, I'm sick of explaining history
I'm rolling with a circle of winners, we claimin' victories
It ain't a mystery, the hate'll make it bittersweet
They hate when I engage to debate 'em like Wale's Twitter feed
Who I'm kidding? I'm the great debater
My crew stay winning, we stay innovating
Your circle is rotten as great tomatoes
They get high with you then start dry snitching like Jose Canseco
Prosecco, I'm sipping vino with a vivid hue
Haberdasher rocking Borsalinos like Hasidic Jews
Pitiful, rappers never stand up to the ridicule
That's why I had to get at you
Wear it if it fit the shoe, nigga
(Baby, just shine your light
If you've gotta dim yours, so they can shine brighter
Just stay bright, so shine your light)
We're in a transitional world right now because
The nature of distribution is changing
The distribution channels that people have built
Over the last century or so are in flux
The print, the visual artist, the musicians
Which on the one hand intimidating and on the other
Immensely liberating. The rules, the assumptions
The now-we're-supposed-tos of how you get your
Work seen and what you do then, they're breaking down
The gatekeepers are leaving their gates
You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen
The old rules are crumbling. And nobody knows what the new rules are
So make up your own rules"

Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
Every day I gotta wake up early
Let it break, thank the Lord at the take
Get the troops, hit the booth, spiritual, it's been great
Practicing my gratitude, life is so beautiful
Working on that attitude, just because
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
Every day I gotta
Trust the God and hustle hard
My grind is real, my hustle dope
I'm finding meals, I'm signing deals
I'm the Gladiator like Russell Crowe
Yeah, you know it's real, but I'm focused still
Why you focus shake it like gold field
'Cause you're not in tune, no, you're not immune
No acclamation, no golden seal
You sick side, gotta flush it down
We talk to folks, cover your mouth
Ain't nobody gonna cover that shifts
So you go to work, you tuff it down
You bust it out till you're out for work
I know your boss a jerk, you're gonna cuss a mouth
Hit it with a bus driver upper-cut
That cock only think you punch him out
I relate to you, you gotta pay your dues
When the time is right you gotta make a move
Your job is what you get paid to do
Your call is what you're made to do
I got faith in you, you're gonna make it through
Cause you don't chase money, money chasing you
Keep laboring like you got a thing to do
Won't taste no foods like they put you
No more wait for you, you gonna take it now
You gonna make a vault
As long as you walk on the earth with that first got to make me proud
Hey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts
Keep talking bout how stressed you are
Better talk about how blessed you are
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
Every day I got to get up early, wake the kids
Get on running made again
Go to work watching in
Every day I'm hustling
Fight the traffic, lose my cool
Get the kids right after school
Think it's hard, yeah, that's true
This is what I have to do
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
What we got is true they listen
Try to talk to gal but is real what I'm spitting
Call Christ by name but still ain't rising
Set to my lane but still ain't listening
Got ice in the vans we make so frigid
Still in the kill brain self when you hit it
Order pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that
Don't stop, get it, get it
Started, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain't living
My soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanks Giving
We love that color 25% more like we like to face prison
But just because the president was black there's no racism?
Postracial? More like most racial
They hate for you disgraceful
Don't let them take you off your base, let them motivate you
Don't let it overtake you, so what another clause
Survive the storm but riding on the beach in the southern wild
Lord knows I had it hard today
Had it hard today
Still I gotta keep my head up high along the way
Cause it only gets better, better
It only gets better from here
It only gets better, better
It only gets better from here"

Whoa! yeah
On top of the world
Yeah, that's how my seeds got me feeling' right now
On top of the world
Yeah, you ever felt like you could do anything (Yeah)
On top of the world
Amani Fela, Diane Ashe, I'ma hold y'all down for real (Gotcha!)
(Talib Kweli)
It was 1996, 4th of July, looking off in the sky
Dealing with thoughts inside, when something caught my eye
It was a silhoutte of a beautiful woman, bright with life
Carrying my first seed, looking like she gone bear fruit tonight
We at the African street festival, and she walking around
Talking about the midwife said, that bring the baby down
I'm about to be a father, the sights and sounds, seem brighter around me
And for starters, I know I'ma work harder, word
We got home at three in the morning, I was beat
Them contractions started coming as soon as I fell asleep
3:05, like every five minutes, then the water broke
We on the go, yelling at the cabbie, 'cause he's sort of slow
You know them hospitals all trying to get paid, no questions
Hear come the doctor's with they drugs, trying to do c-sections
But my baby stay's strong, in labor for yay long
Eight-pound baby boy, to carry my name on, joy!
(Mos Def) + (Talib Kweli)
Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
See my brother, I know how you feel, Kweli, I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
So when you, have a seed, come in the world, say dog that shit's real
(That's the sound of joy, y'all)
Huh, Kweli, yo I know how you feel, Kweli, yo I know how you feel
My baby girl
(Talib Kweli)
June 10th, 1999, I been on the grind
Since the birth of my son, it's been about, way more then rhymes
Baby on the way, my lady glowing today, at least
That's what the midwife said, on the phone
Anyway, the music got me going away
Like everyday, but it's a blessing, so I gotta have patience
And she got pregnant on a Jamaican vacation
So it's all good, this time well have the baby in a house
I went the hospital route, I know what they all about (Never again)
So I'm out on tour, in Baltimore
Get the call around four, when the water hit the floor (Damn!)
I gotta rock my show, but I gotta go
Got second thoughts about her not going, to the hospital
I left the show early, Mos held me down, good looking (No doubt)
Call the car service, like, take me straight to Brooklyn (Uh huh)
Got the news in the car, stayed sorta calm
But I cried tears of joy, when they put my daughter in my arms, how precious!
(Mos Def) + (Talib Kweli)
Huh, huh
Said I know how you feel, uh, said I know how you feel when you
(My precious joy)
Said I know how you feel, uh, Kwe I know how you feel

Huh, man I know how you feel (yeah), said I know how you feel
(Talib Kweli)
I do it for the seeds y'all, in they formative years when they need y'all
We gotta believe, in what we conceive y'all, it's deep y'all
I give them the truth, so they approach the situation, with ammunition
I keep nothing away, they hear everything, 'cause they know how to listen
Teach them the game, so they know they position, so they can grow
And make decisions, that change the world, and break old tradition
They put kids in jail, for a life they ain't even get to start
That's murder too, and it's breaking my heart, it's breaking our nation apart
We gave the youth all the anger, it's just
We ain't taught them, how to express it, and so it's dangerous
You can't talk to them
Unless your language is relating to what they going through
So busy ignoring them, you can't see what they showing you
And you wonder, why we called baby-daddy's and baby-momma's
When we grow up, we can't act like adult mothers and fathers, yo
I'm so blessed to have a boy and a girl, everyday they bring joy to my world
(Mos Def) + (Talib Kweli)
Huh, yeah
I know how you feel, Kweli I know how you feel
(That's the sound of joy)
Brother Kwe', I know how you feel, Brother Kwe', I know how you feel
(Baby girl, my precious joy)
Kweli, I know how you feel, say bro' I know how you feel

Huh, if you know how the people feel, let me really know how you... yo

Please, hold your applause till the end
We are glad to come and hear you speak

Kweli doesn't like me to talk about this but one time we were drivin' through the Mississippi Delta
And there was a brotha runnin' up the side of the road
And he didn't have any, shoes on
He didn't have a, shirt on
And I started to drive right by this man but Kweli said, ""Stop the car, beause that brotha, might be in trouble""
And I stopped the car
Kweli said to the man, he said,
""Brotha, are you OK? Do you need a ride somewhere?""
And the man looked at Kweli and said,
""Shhhh ... I'm escapin'""
And Kweli took him by the hand and said,
""My brotha, you didn't get the memo. We have been FREE, for some time now""
Well, I'm windin' it up

Goin' out in a blaze with the biscuit
Got the streets hooked like the 'caine that you sniffin'
Why? Why would you ever go against it?
If I gave a fuck about you it'd be borderline offensive
It's senseless, stalkin' on my page and my mentions
Walkin' on eggs and you soundin' all defensive
Hear dogs hollerin'
That's your ego talkin' and you're listenin'

Rappin' how they're rich and all their jewelry is glistenin'
Your mortgage underwater like I walked in on a christenin'

I don't fuck with these niggas, nope
I'm smoother than a criminal
I never trust niggas with no books in the livin' room
When there's no electricity, what the fuck is digital?
Beyoncé married Jigga but they think we all jiggaboos
Don't get confused by the lyric
Protector of my city, stand alone on the citadel
Wake up in the mornin', say a prayer 'cause I'm livin' well
Proof of a miracle, it's spiritual
These niggas go from robbin' punchlines, to bein punchlines
For lunchtime, you ain't got the heart when it's crunch time
Soldiers gettin' shot on the front line
Not really for a cause but for they brothers they lay their lives when it come time
Trust being brave is a challenge
If every soldier was brave, there'd be no word for valor
The nerve of these cowards, who are you, the herb of the hour?
I treat my girl like horiculture, I'm preservin' the flower

Yo, I'm headin' out, 'bout to do some flesh and now
I know my flesh endowed with somethin' to prove
I'm settin' out on a trip to Heaven's mile
Yeah, I'm steppin' out in the name of love
Who knew the Devil could slow dance?
We have pathological romances with technological advance
Infatuated with infatuation and
Intellectual masturbation with premature ejaculation
Make a baby mama's all bastardization and
Lonely people all through the city
They club hoppin' and they love shoppin' and they thug posturin'
Thugs be lockin' horns with Crips on them drug blocks
And them dollars flow right out of the 'hood
When you tryin' to make paper out of the wood
You know that money don't grow on trees
For paper people change colors like leaves
And they fall off in the mud like a filthy pig
Makin' you and your dogs who store all call off
That much deserved ass whippin'
He snitchin', he twitchin', he bitchin', he all soft
Never work with his hands
Little kid on the block who always ran
At all costs, gotta be in the club
Lookin' for happiness or the meaning of love
Then it hit him, out the blue like a vision
All of a sudden he don't like the way he been livin'
And wanna be forgiven
How I know? 'Cause I'm right there wit' him

So much cleavage and asscrack
If pussy were a stock it would plummet on the Nasdaq
Blank stares like nobody care
In a room so exclusive nobody there
But really, truth is that nobody there
'Cause it's feelings inside that nobody share
I want God to smile on me
But see, fame is a drug and you wild on E
Celebrities take a ??? like Christmas trees
Got complex like they want a Christmas Eve
Sing a song to yourself and you stand alone
Get nominated for a gold gramophone
Walk the red carpet, left your man at home
Security snatchin' people camera phones
You got rose gold yellow bottles, pink Cashmere
So ahead of the trend, that's so last year
Last month, last day, last hour, last minute
Your pursuit of crew is so passionate
??? The cash in it, laugh in his face
If it's def or anybody who don't stay in his place
So popular can't go no where, folks stoppin' ya
Might want to check a thermometer
When you go to a movie heat rises
Surrounded by people still lonely, that's why you need disguises

Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure

They never tell you that degree is just a receipt
You be paying off them loans till you're 6 feet deep

In my environment every snitch gon' have to die
You ask me why
'Cause my entitlement is American as apple pie
It's hard to get a check, it's easy to get in debt
Then get it wet
You could get a little head for a little bread
That shit is dead
Get by, get over
You gotta get ahead or be back in the shelter by 12 so you can get a bed
The conditions you raised in is preyin on your decision-making
You concentrating on that short paper
The broad paper, that hard candy, that jaw breaker
The dark side of the force pay for that Lord Vader

My money good (x4)
Can't touch it

Money talk

Before there was [?] musicians performing on the street corners
Out in the deep forest
The city drop the beat, the night air sing a sweet chorus
The trees lean toward us in order to take in the CO2 that we let out and convert it into oxygen
Every time you blow a breath out you start the cycle again
Recycle the wind, spin it any way you want it
It's priceless, this life is a blessing
No matter how you slice it or dice it, you can grill it like a swordfish
A beautiful mind, the bars gorgeous
I know I'm a suspect
When I'm walking and the streets is like my office
We the working class artists
They wishin that we was porpoise
But I know my worth
Tell 'em to make an offer of gold first
I'm in the fight of my life and I'm taking the whole purse
Soul search
For getting paid for creating the cold verse
Got the money on my mind
Tryna escape and it don't work

Hotter power play
Remember how they accused her of saying
She did her album without help
Then she went to Rome to sing
And tell the Pope about herself

Started rolling with the Marleys
Got back with her crew at Dave Chapelle's Block Party
She made songs about Zion

Took the Blackstar on tour in Europe
I was so grateful
Speaking for myself but I'm sure I could speak for Dante
I got to watch a show with Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte
We used to chill at Nkiru, her moms was a customer
She used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler
Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren
What the album did for black girls' souls was so important
I got concerned when she got sick on the road
She ain't heavy, I'm a brother
And I wish that I could pick up the load, but no
Every night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Another night slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel
Got your assistant on the the phone
""I need to talk to Lauryn""
And I wanna walk through the storm, and I could be the umbrella
When the rain is pouring
Please, this no disrespect to whoever your man is though
This relationship is strictly music like D'angelo
I know you hate Babylon, and wanna see it fall
But they won't let you read your poem at the BET awards
You give us hope, you give us faith, you the one
They don't like what you got to say
But still they beg you to come, whoa
Now that's powerful sis, it's black power
We get money, keep our eyes on the final hour
And no I ain't saying you Christ, that would be sacriligous right?
But you can blow up the night, sisters the rats is vicious
The raps the sisters recite with their black fist up
The devil's last wish is a queen that rise past bitches
We used to read Francis Crest or anything
By Third World Press will press
But what the power of the word suggest
Hatched ideas in our heads like birds in the nest
You gave birth to a new sound like Don did West, yes
Should I be saying all of this while the mic is on?
I might as well let it out because one day I might be gone
I write this song and hope you feel how much we love you
And you play it, 'cause I really ain't got the words to say it
But yo
Every night, slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Another night slips away
In other words, I should say
There are no words, you should say
There are no words
Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real
Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel"
69,My Weather Report,2007,Eardrum (2007),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"C'mon, Yeah
I like to take this opportunity, to thank everybody who been riding with me so far
It's a been a long journey
But they say your life's path is not about the destination
It's all about the journey
I appreciate y'all
It's my blood, sweat, tears, years
Struggle, love, hate, fear
New york city!
You could make it here, you could make it anywhere
I came to prepare
For the rain, hail, sleet, snow
Whatever the weather, we ride
Let my people go!
To a place where knowledge is born
We welcome you to the 3rd eye of the storm
Check it out!
Futuristic lyricist, straight from the renaissance
Top of the suffer chain, raps up a edge a lot
My people suffering, slave to another chain
This voyage is maiden, like my mother of the name
Is this your first trip to hell?
Avenge a capitalist, if it's a product then we got it for sell
When I first started to spell, my words fell into rhymes
Turned into songs, everything else fell into line
I paint the pictures, you could see the people bleeding my bars
When I was a teen, I was mean, about to reach for the stars
So if I fail or fell, write in the clouds, tighten the vowel
Niggaz word, there use to be no bitin allowed
Now the gangsters no grindin' allowed
Probably see a fight in the stage, fore you see a fight in the crowd
I send this out to my people facing the storm
Homie we riding it out
You inspire what I'm writing about
It's the 3rd eye of the storm
It's the 3rd eye of the storm
It's the 3rd eye of the storm
It's the 3rd eye of the storm
Check it out!
Check it out!
Check it out!
Been fucking around!
I'm not a judge, but I'm handing out sentences
To political prisoners, regular inmates with no visitors
Niggaz in the streets outside to reach up for ministers
Not those that say they spiritual, but actual parishoners
Rap listeners, we open the black businesses
This underground shit, with samples to lack clearances
Once you get a past appearances
You could tell who shit is fake and who's shit is based upon the past experiences
We really been to war, hand to hand like crack sales
Bill the man, the man they try to kill off the blackmail
Female left to raise up a son
From the day he was one
Till he twenty, and he raise up a gun
Get the blazin', fore the blaze of the sun
Smoke bracin' his lung
Young in his years and he's facing a ton
None of his peers wanna share the road
Love the child, care to provider
But they hand a blunt and share saliva
You ain't a rider
And you hustlin' backwards
To many excess, with imitating these crackers
So our kids looking up to drug dealers and rappers
Taking away all the work away from our black actors
Revelation is first and armageddon is after
Tsunami's, hurricanes and natural disasters
Fast food culture be this, is always a factor
It's the gratification
They want the cash faster!
It's the 3rd eye of the storm
It's the 3rd eye of the storm
It's the 3rd eye of the storm
It's the 3rd eye of the storm
It's the place where knowledge is born!
Check it out! check it out!

First time I let her in my bed she got wetter then the perfect storm
That we weathering together and
This the first time that I've ever considered wedding rings
But first things first yo
I met her at the bar rolling with three wise men like I followed the star
There she is shorty bi coastal
Thick like bifocals, stacked like 2Pac vocals her body so loco
Jewel of the Nile so I'm romancing the stone
The rhythm is to the words and I watched her dance to my poems
The way she move them hips let me know in advance that she grown
I pictured it like Paris Hilton when she answered the phone, yo
Dancing alone because she extra fly
But I got good look so I catch her eye
Gave the rest a try now give the best a try
Leave your nest and I'll fly make you testify
Damn baby I know we got some haters and.
I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to see
Because I never been in love before
You running back to the kid like this was home base
Or a marathon I let you set your own pace
Your own space and the beautiful struggle
Now baby tell what's it gonna take to prove that I love you
When I'm gone you be missing me too
It let me know that my prayers is the music God be listening to
Don't get it confused I'm trying to get religious with you
I never thought I feel like this it's like a miracle you
You You stole my heart like a crook in love
Crossing the bridge to the Brooklyn love
When I took above it's clear skies that's surrounding my earth
Your love is drugs and I'm down to serve let's deal with it yo
We go to the spot and you still get it low
I get excited fast and still love to hit it slow
Till the walls come tumbling down like Jericho
And you hear the sound is stereo
Hear we go
I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to see
Because I never been in love before
You looked good when I tried you on
So I had to write a song
Use to be the guy that always made her cry when I'm gone
Always kept a stable and I never spent a night alone
No cable or no hard line phone why
I'm never home scared of commitment
Ready to forever roam
We at war like sister souljah and she welcome to my terror dome
Head strong our connection proved them haters dead wrong
From now to R.I.P. Proceeds my name up on the headstone
Leave her be for five minutes
Dudes try to dive in it first
They want to spit on my name and tarnish my image
I tell them do you I don't care who she speaking with
Because I already know she made it clear who she leaving with
And it feels so beautiful
Put it in a rhyme because it feel so musical
Plus you ain't no groupie hoe
Sitting in the studio
Before we do this though there something that you should know
I don't care what people say
As long as you and me okay
Because I never been in love before
See I use to be a player and
All of this is new to me
And this ain't what I'm used to see
Because I never been in love before"
71,New Leaders,2013,Gravitas (2013),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"Welcome to the new age where they're thirsty for that Kool-Aid
Thirsty for first in that page, really thirsty just to be fake
Be the first to hate what you say, trying to diss you calling you ""gay""
Such an urgent need to express yourself, but really nothing to say
Don't fuck with us, we too tough, get high like you do drugs
Like spit me out I'm chewed up my life is chopped and screwed up
I know you up in this club, I know you don't give a fuck
You told me what you don't like, you made that clear, now what do you love?
There's gotta be more
Some live the life of the rich, some people gotta be poor
I've been through a door
I will not sell you a dream, that's what the lottery for
The music is clay, I shaped it, I molded it
Like it was pottery or the mouth with the law
Twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw
Free as the diamond you found on the floor
Furnished the rhyme with the proper decor
I burnished the nine in my mind with the galore
So they burning with shaman, I'm popping the door
To top off the law
If your style is married to substance, you sound like you got a divorce
That's why I'm blocking and unfollowing y'all
I done forgot what I'm following for
Enough about y'all, now back to me
Ain't no academic leave, I'm not faculty
These new slaves ain't ready for my masterpiece
So when they hear me rap it's catastrophe
Cause a casualty so casually they mistake what I do for having beef
I don't actually wish anybody harm, now stretch your arms and clap for me
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming
Catch up with us 'cause we leaving
Got enough followers
I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders

I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders
Got enough followers
I'm looking for some new leaders
Ever since the day I was born, that marks the day I was chosen
To rise above them all and be a leader, I'm like Malcolm X when on the podium
Martin Luther with a dream, Rosa Parks on the bus
Though as funny as it seems it remind me of us
Through the money and the fame ain't shit gon' change for the light we adjust
Do it for the children without a ceiling to live up under
Times getting hard, that's why my niggas smoke that tropic thunder
If all our people spread love instead of evil
We would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal
Stay true, I gave you my oath
What would the ancient God my nigga Thoth
Through all the books and the screens I was taught
I look at myself and pretend to learn the most
Our leaders dead and gone, what's left for the believers?
If you looking for the truth, one word: Underachievers, nigga
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming
Catch up with us 'cause we leaving
Got enough followers
I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders

I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders
I'm looking for some new leaders
Got enough followers
I'm looking for some new leaders
As I change the so called predestined course of my life
Advance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light
Moving these intricate insecurities out of sight
Moving myself onward from the darkness into the light
I take flight, it's goodbye to all the negativity
That plague millions of young innocent souls like me
Gave me the genius mind state necessary
To feast off of this unlimited figurative tree
Of life, I tried to tell these niggas that our purpose is to move it
Something like Darwin's beliefs of humans in evolutions
As I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism
I wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism
Would you rest my soul, I'm blinding me to a blurry of visions
In light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)
And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)
Wake up cause no you're not dreaming
Catch up with us 'cause we leaving

Damn right, we got it
Damn right, I'm 'bout it
Police state trying to kill us
Will they succeed? I doubt it
Y'all don't want no problems
So lame nigas be quiet
We 'bout to start the survival
We 'bout to start the survival
That's why we can't have nice things
That's why we can't have nice things
Used to race home after school
Just to turn on the tube
To catch the new videos, thought I was cool
I'm talking Snoop, Dr. Dre, to Fugees, to Biggie, to Diddy, to Wu
My O.G. will come from the spot with the loot
Like, ""Kweli you nice, niga. Hop in the booth.""
Together Forever, the name of the crew
Now, I wonder is there any real rap left; is it just me yelling no justice no peace? (hands up!)
This new video full of black death, fuck rap 'cause we dying at the hands of the police (hands up!)
Horror movies don't get no scarier than the way cops treating nigas in America
See more videos of cops trying to bury us than ISIS, you tell me who's the terrorist
Terrorists making bomb threats ain't got shit on the Prison Industrial Complex
Slavery to Jim Crow, now force my kinfolk into poverty, living in the projects! (trapped!)
Coming such a long way from living like kings
Now we like bling, wanna pull up in a white thing. (you trapped, niga)
This is why we can't have nice things
Got to be prepared for the drama that it might bring
Jealousy gonna tear us apart
They say it's all love, but what's in their hearts?
The product in nigas, kidnapping your wife
You're out in the desert like what's in the box?
In your Brad Pitt voice
So what you have is a choice
You can have all of us thinking you're moist
Or get like Chuck D and start bringing the noise
Rap life I attack like a pit bull
Let it off like a clip full
Known to stand up to all that bullshit that you sit through
Tell the world what we've been through, it's pitiful
Portrait of the artist as a young man
Raised in a borough in Brooklyn in the late 80's
Rap crazy are the crack babies who act shady when snitches start singing like the fat lady
Amadeus, you know what it is
Damn right, we got it
Damn right, I'm 'bout it
Police state trying to kill us
Will they succeed? I doubt it

Lame niggas be quiet
We 'bout to start the survival

That's why we can't have nice things
That's why we can't have nice things
Naw, it ain't trap rap
It ain't backpack (what's that?)
This is what you sound like when you have facts
And you're facing down the cops in a gas mask
Y'all be listening to lames? Well, we past that
Half-assed rap, you can have that back
All you fake deep niggas where your hashtag at?
Cut you open on the mic when I'm showing you the light
Niggas scatter like roaches, where the black flag at?
Radio solace is coming I promise you nigas I give you a preview (it's coming)
Transparency, that's the key
I got nothing to hide you niggas is see through
Trans parent, no Caitlyn genital
Tatted up but you faker than henna ho
Black Star with the bars that expose you
Just like you posed nude, no centerfold

I start a new beginning, at this is how it begun
From, KRS-One to Talib Kweli
Now I'm the best superstar on BET
And MTV, better yet I'm known universally
I am the key, to being the best MC
The prophecy, the one and only
A timeless masterpiece, I ain't the least
I'm the best, cause God said so
I'm just trying to express my lyrical flow

Notes from the piano is falling out the sky
Like angels losing their wings so they see how it feel to cry
Babies have babies for the welfare coupons
Dudes on the radio rapping, them cats is lukewarm
I get up on it, spit up on it like a new born
The family structure ruptured, there's living proof like a group home
B-Boy being a man, throw a suit on
Stepping out hotter than ??? when the soup's on
My son like ""Daddy, I be missing you when you gone""
I said I gotta go so I can stack chips like Lou Corn
I ask my daughter how I look, she fixed my hat so I can wear it cool
'Cause she's like ""That's what they wear in school""
Then she asked me ""Daddy, you know any superstars?""
I looked at her and said ""Stop being silly, that's what you two are""
I say it now and I've said it before
And you can trust me on this 'cause I've been through it y'all
Follow your heart and you can do it dog
Baby you're a star...

Yet another way to show you how, how special you are
There ain't no body, that can take that away from you

Even though...

Yeah, yo, yo, yo
And even though mummy and daddy might fight all through the night
Argue and fuss, you a part of us that we've got to get right
I don't love you to death, 'cause I love you to life
And you a teenager, you might not want my advice
You might be full of spite, think you're grown, still a tyke
And say things that cut like a patient under the knife
I say this, 'cause I was once a teenager too
And respect for my peers is really all that I related to
But I made it through, you gonna make it too
So much I wanna say to you...

It's the year of the Blacksmith
Kweli, aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo, we need some new leaders
Politicians is lying, now artists is true divas
They meant to deceive us, they were sent to defeat us
Everybody in here shot his peers through the speakers
Guerrilla tactics, I'm a find a weapon, drop a rhyme or
Find a session, give you a final lesson in your final seconds
Liberation ain't the illest vinyl pressing?
Yeah right, and the government ain't lying about 911
Find me repping Brooklyn on the daily, what the dealy?
Questioning my teachers like ""Oh, really?"" so they feel me
Based on fraudulent facts as they practice like O'Reilly
Making me a hero for the class to come behind me
It's collusive like your newest sneakers, ain't you glad you waited?
This year I graduated, y'all niggas is super seniors
Stay getting left behind, this the year of the Blacksmith
Liberation clearly a classic
People want to live it up, what, what's your drug of choice?
What, what, give it up, what, let me hook it up
Over the counter intelligence got ya hooked
You's a gonna when I'm on the corner selling it
Cats after the pot of gold like the luck of the Irish
I don't fuck with silly broads, I only fuck with the flyest

Usually I'm late and they saying my name over the loud speaker (Talib Kweli)

I took a train from Brussels to Antwerp, the cops find pieces
Don't get it twisted, London got dime pieces
We stopping in Amsterdam for top of the line reefers
Trying to get to Egypt for the pyramids in Giza
Got me tripping like Cameron Diaz in Tanzania
A family guy on a grind, still we up heed her
I'm using poetic licence like onomatopoeia
Headed to Philadelphia, I'm yelling out ""Free Mumia""
CDs selling like nuclear weapons in North Korea
Madlib, Talib Kweli, we off the meter
To start a fight, I'm coursing your life, the talk is cheaper
Yeah, yeah
This the Liberation, rhyming is my occupation
Occupation of a nation, drop the population
From creating self-esteem, plus the stream of consciousness
When I got it into being I helped to free the populace
Bred to black, green to black is wrapped around a magazine
Under pressure said the freshman at Cheshire academy
Kicked out of Brooklyn Tech, focusing on looking fresh
Bright kid accepted to the schools that only took the best
Bounce like a check, yes, without no hesitation
I went to college, then I left, that's when I got my education
Still live my regrets, now how I'll would I be with a degree?
Use would just a piece of paper to me, a receipt
One day I might go back, shit, who am I kidding?
How can I live a stupid decision?
Get used to the prison that I built for myself
It's all real, true in lividness so I rap to put food in the kitchen, c'mon

Dig in your pockets and leave with your funds faster
Fuck it new rap rookies
Get beat to death New Jack Pookie

When I was a young man I had stars in my eyes
You couldn't tell if it was a twinkle or if I was startin' to cry
Time is wrinkled like the hands of the elders that love us
I find a window to watch the path like ghetto grandmothers
They says eyes is the windows to ya soul
So I open the the blind to feel the breeze blowin' in from the winter chain
Surround myself with images of bravery
'Cause the soul of my people bared witness to slavery
I seen the inside of my heart it get dark
Like the flesh of my bone
And heavy like the breath of this poem
Plus, I seen lands so dry the trees cry
Tears fallin' like it's autumn the leaves die
Pre-packaged futures freeze dried, cross me by
The body count in the streets is knee high
Plus, I seen pubbles so deep the puddles speak
Ripe with stories that leap from the cluttered street
Blood'll be beet-red runnin' through the gutters 'cause heat
The currency that we exchange with folks who tryin' to eat
I cried in my sleep, seen trains speedin' down the tracks of my tears
Runnin' down the face of the Earth, c'mon
I see it in the space that was the place of my birth
I play eye tag with death - she's such a flirt
That's some scary shit, I put it all in my music
Real loud makin' a scene if I seen it I use it, yeah
Beautiful strugglin' 'n' so I'm used to the bubblin'
What I be utterin' so hot it got the homeless people huddlin'
Haters mutterin' under breath, who ain't the best?
See the scavengers 'n' vultures pickin' at what's left
I rise from the ashes like a phoenix - believe it
Flow brand new like a fetus - believe it
Mean what I say if I say it, I mean it
I lived it, I breathed it, believe me, I seen it
(Jean Grae)
Man I pray y'all passionate
I swing out like a little leaguer on a Sunday ignorin' the Catholics
Rebel rap with a spine plated metal back
I never fold medal gold with a vaultin' pole
Nigger I'm better known as light let me shine on you
Mind confident rhyme dominant lines constant
Caramello color hella mellow
The fellows run up 'n' ""Hello""
Hella sorrow when I tell 'em taken ""Holla""
I got that horror vision, they say I'm masochistic
I don't think it's crazy they call me shady I'm flattered, get it?
My image is sick I'm in need of a medic
I should get a permanent residence in hospital bed it's
THe way I freak shit, you meek like that old rapper chick
I smack an actor in a wall till his back's in the brick
I rig 'em all with the mind basement 'n' trapdoors
It's me I'll clap the survivors until I see some rigor mortis
I seen the forest through the trees
But only because I cut off all the leaves
And left 'em blowin' off into the breeze
That I create whenever I speak
I'm cheap fuck it, I need to win something
Before I kick this rap bucket in
Fuck it again, fuck you if this hasn't struck you
As a genius stickin' out like a bucktooth
I'm couth, yes I know it mostly regarded as pottymouth
Dirty like the city ground you on when the shotties come out
I'm witty plus I'm incredibly diligent
Dream of the president mac-millied I'm militant
I go along like a Philly bed I pity you
Silly fool I know ain't nobody really feelin' you"
77,Push Thru,2013,Prisoner Of Conscious (2013),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun's rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It's darkest before light
I'm gonna push through
Turbo charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain't nothing band-aids won't cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can't say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi's hurting y'all with kicks, I'm the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain't gotta
I'm already on some whole other, word to yo muhfuckin self
Nobody else gon' do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone'll offer ya help, but they ain't doing nothing
'Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain't bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun's rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It's darkest before light
I'm gonna push through
When you a man, action is what's expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that's free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It's coonery, it's lunacy, let's make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I'm on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is 'cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join 'em so you gotta beat 'em
It's carpe diem hey (hey) yeah
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun's rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It's darkest before light
I'm gonna push through
Like kindergarteners
My vision's bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving'll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in-
To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That's what my mental say, but my physical's been detached
I'm on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where's the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing by my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
I'm focused
I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun's rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It's darkest before light
I'm gonna push through"

As the world get hyped from hearin our musical conversation

Given birth on the track 'cause the cypher stay pregnant with ideas
And we rockin' it - rock, rock, rockin' it
Tell the hater players put a sock in it!

How cats look more like dicks than the Washington monument
Validly try to challenge me, but who you racin wit'
It's amazing the lyrical lyngerie I be lacin shit, we be blazin' it

And your answer kept changin 'cause bitch you keep lyin'
Talkin' bout 'he make me sick

And he only wanna fuck me when he all for that dough'

Hype niggas make girls be like 'get off me stop'

Lighten it up, brighten it up, yea
You want the grown step your bars up
You brag about the scrilla them killas lighten your cars up
Welcome to the complete history of the one known as Talib Kweli
Such a blessing, I'm making the bread leven
Descendant of Terra Firma
I'm from the era of legend
The blind to my eyesight
Too scared of the world ending
My men of spiritual essence be walking right into heaven
Ascending without the stairs, expressing without the fears
We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers
Unravelling minds, travelling through time like langoliers
Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier
In the park of Washington Square, locks in my hair
Louder than the bull horns we was locking 'em there
Cops would prepare to lock us up
They was scared like tales from the dark side
Summer of the Central Park five
1989 was the number, the year that I started rhyming
From Brooklyn to Staten Island them Decepticons was wildin'
Music soothing but the imagery violent as bomb threats
Therapy for the prison industrial complex
Provided the context for the crime with the tec nine
At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine
I did it to death on my grind on a quest to get signed
Sorta like the tribe would always suggest we check the rhyme
An internal with Puff Daddy, in front of the buffed patio
Rolling with Hi Tek in the MPV through the streets of the 'Nati
Before graduating to Caddies was carrying crates
Shoutout to Flex all day doing records with John Forte
We was standing outside the tower devouring prey
Powerful display of bullet points that we shower and spray the block with
Back in them salad days these rappers was appetizers
I played it like I was David, I was tackling that Goliath
Attacking the open mics to the victory was decisive
This life it was so enticing, my surgery so precise
I would chop it like thin slices at parties we politic
At the country club, lighting up dutches with Pac and Big
At the crib of supernatural battling back and forth
Back before Jean was in the unsigned hype in the back of The Source
Rest in peace to Allah's sons
Shabba was liking to call you son
Cause you mine I call you son cause you shine
What's up Alyasha, this is OG Brooklyn shit
Not for impostors, pour out a shot of vodka for them
Big L, Big Poppa, Big Pun, 2Pac
The jungle is too savage, rap true master producing the new classic
This shit is too classic it's blow to [?] to spinal tap
I started with the Rawkus Recording we work the vinyl backwards
From DEF JUX to Loaded Lux
I'm the underground king like I'm rolling with Bun and [?]
The flow is nuts it's solid I got the golden touch
Plus my iron sheek and I got the game and the cobra clutch
This the highest calibre do the algebra
From Yasiin Bey to Jean Grey to Pharoahe Monch
Black Thought to Common
Almost 20 years after the release of Soundbombing
And it still sounds timeless
I'm out and on tour with the greatest, A Tribe Called Quest
And the De La's, opened for Jay Z and Nas, who else could say this?
In Vegas with Tech 9 getting faded before the gig
Only later to hit the RIO and hop on the stage with Prince
True story, I always knew the importance of great shows
Since 1992 I seen Ice Cube play Toad's, way cold
Continue to pave the road for the Kendricks and J Coles
Continue to stake gold
From making the way for Kanye to meetings with Mr. Harry Belafonte
All started on park benches with Dante
Predicting the future, so observant I'm clairvoyant
The frame can't contain it, I'm painting a rare portrait"
80,Ready Set Go,2013,Prisoner Of Conscious (2013),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"I switch lanes; it's still blurry, then switch frames
Clowning these lames -- you're Bill Murray in Quick Change
Control your mission, keep up with my pole position
Brag it about the ride you're whipping, your soul is missing
Racing to your death or the holiest celebration
God bless our lady of holy accelerate
'Cause we speeding while we drive on this highway of information
The devil try to deny us the highest of elevation
They keep us at sea level so I'm staying on my A game
They local like the C when I express like the A train
My a-alikes take what I write, use it to maintain
We be alike and see alike, 'cause we got the same brain
We in the same chains, work in the same fields
Now we're independent, you can keep your fucking lame deal
Total package, the flow is mastered, I'm blowing past the procrastinators
So fast, it's like they going backwards
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I'll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
They hate when I give 'em some straight they need chase
Half these little boys coming faster than speed racer
Pulling capers with my team best believe I'll be seeing paper
With extraordinary gentlemen, trust me the league major
On the highway of life I'm faster than cop cars
Quicker than the tongues of the rappers that got bars
Never rattled 'cause we been through the battles, we got scars
This the international half of the Black Star
This is the sound that you're missing I'm here when your ears listen
Play it loud in your whip when you're dippin your gear shifting
Gifted like the island of the misfit toys, ladies apply like the lipstick.
Boys take over when the shit drop
Boys wanna holla at birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Men wanna talk to the women, we ain't screaming
Just whisper in their ear and we're leavin'
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I'll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
When it's gone to the wire
I gotta win to the fire
You can't stop it. No, you can't stop it
Because I'm destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know it's happening
At the time, get ready, set, go
On your mark, get set, when I start the jet
Look how far I get, I'm not only an artist they say
One is the loneliest number but still regardless
The second best don't exist, it's a little oxymoronic
What a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high
Watermarks, cause the market's flooded with garbage
You are now embraced by the light with fiber optic
Shine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic
Prisoner of conscious, nonsense
I can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake
It's so ironic, it's beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral
We don't get it away
Rappers nowadays are confusing you
I know you're tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake
That's why I'm leaping the faith, keeping the pace
Although it's all about the winning, it's never about the wait
Life's so short, we can't afford to lose
When the guns go off and the flag drops
I'll never stop
I'mma race to the finish line of the road
To kick in the door

Okay, 1-2
Yo I'm Brooklyn like the '90s
Brownsville and Bushel keep it grimey
When I'm from flatbush that's where you'll find me
In Brooklyn, Tek wit' Justin and Sadat
And Free and Sid from ???
Always catch me wit' Juju and Rubiks, we was truant kids
Dollar band nooseses
Jump bell, run, and never look back
Mr. Man kept the hammer in his bookbag
Rubiks introduced me to Black and Forte
DJ Enuff on Avenue K I go back a long way
Wit' Super Nat in Washington Square freestylin' everyday
Peformin' at Lyricists' Lounge who ate off Jean Grae
Fuckin' wit' Mood is how I met Hi-Tek
Black Star came in effect when Elijah gave my tape to Mos Def
Reflection Eternal was next on deck
My crew the best and we proved it
We knew our music was the Vanguard of a movement
Every Rawkus release was bangin', they on the come up
They was like fuck the radio till Pharoahe said ""Get the fuck up""
Flex listened, jabbin' at Bryant
The next position was right about now we need the radio hit written
While I hit the road
On tour to support the records since the day it was sold
Corey had me followin' the example of De La Soul
Common and The Roots to me these the sickest niggaz
Get my figures wit' the Okayplayers and the Spitkickers
Rawkus got a deal with MCA, this the gray area
But let it stir for Music Cemetery of America
They tried to fool you by switchin' the name to Geffen
Now they Interscope's bitch and every artist who had a chance left 'em
Ain't no big surprise, wasn't no love there
Jimmy Iovine never signed me, I just kinda ended up there
But fuck that, literally it was my way or the highway
Hit the road with the Beastie Boys and toured Europe with Kanye
Gotta thank 'em for the love on the album
I knew out on ""Electric Circus""
He'd get it by any means necessary like Malcolm
I dropped a single, shot a video, took control of my situation
Got a label poppin', it's a celebration (bitches)
Yo boy Free I had to get out
I put you on, that's where I'm at right about now
And if you're sayin' it's my time, you right about now
This what's goin' through my mind right about now
Hey yo, hey yo, it's time to write about now
And if you lookin' you can find it right about now
I put you on, that's where I'm at right about now

Cut checks like cuticles, bust tecs at funerals
My sound freak you out like rough sex in the studio
I blow the back out the track when I black out
Got the spot maxed out, people in the front pass out
Security carry that ass out
Get in the zone when I'm stoned like I live in a glass house
Last bout I was in started to get real serious
Homeboy got dropped and spazzed out like mysterious
The boy in the hood with the furious style
We in the age of Aquarius now, yo
I show pain in the manner of Coltrane's ""Alabama""
Niggaz wanna blaze a hammer
""Real girls get down on the flo'"" like David Banner when I handle my shit

Like when niggaz pray over beef like Khalil and get the metal till the shit is settled
I pull strings like Geppetto did Pinocchio
Y'all niggaz sing to po-po like, K-Ci and JoJo or Sisqo and Nokio
LeLe and Coco y'all, Sisters With Voices
Y'all, lyrics are pointless
My lyrics anoint like, oils and ointments
I had a big death but I missed my appointment
Y'all walkin' through the valley while I run through it
Every party we come through makin' the ""Gun Music""
Practice the (Art of War), don't make me Sun Tzu it
I put them knots in yo' head till you can't undo it
You can't unscrew it, ladies wanna take it off
All they want is piece of mind so I break 'em off
I grab the game by the balls until I made it cough
And made these bitch ass niggaz take they make-up off

Blood splattered all on you shirt like a Miskeen
Y'all niggas trippin' like mescaline and mixed greens
My flow cleaner than the Sistine, pristine
You going green like Al Gore with 'em
I make algorithms that got Malcolm in 'em
God's favorite, I'm sick as a doctor's patient
We live in a cold world, my job is to rock nations
My occupation? Elation, a celebration of rebels
Raise the levels and the decibels flagrant

Our flowers is the loudest, they crowd around us
But cower in the shadows of the towers, boy

While I'm inflicting the pain and making it suitable for any occasion

Quickly back you up and bag your bitch
She's reminding me of Sanaa Lathan
Rely on the hating while I'm smiling and waiting

The mightiest making of a classic, alrighty, I'll face it
My psyche is ancient and I'm hiring, so try me, I'm patient
Sorry, I'm lying, face it, I'm back for the taking
I'm urgently giving niggas the courtesy of smashing their face in
(Damn, can you cut his mic off?)
See how we got 'em buggin'
'Cause they can't believe what we have in the making
Shit so historic, got me goin' for it while I bang the nation
And do niggas greasier than a slab of bacon

Stop cooking that damn pork in this house

Sacrifice myself for the music and let them suffer through me
Your weak product is nothing to me
I only feel effects when I fuck with Louis
Yep, I get buck in the studio like I'm Evil Dee
Pulling strings like the Muppet movie
Shining my light like Mos calling his mother Umi
Who's the hottest regardless of who's flaming?
We ain't talkin' 'bout the best until you mention my name
Who're you kidding? The truest spitting
I'll break you like a mirror so it's clearer
That we don't believe in superstition
These new additions need supervision
Thinking that they can spit it in the booth like me
What are you stupid? Listen
I've been official, it's been official, I'm too consistent
I make a claim 'cause I'm too official for euphemisms
Staying in the cut like a new incision

Way before Bush the USA been bombin
Cause whether ratchets or needles know the shootin ain't stoppin'
Niggaz lootin, we ain't coppin a thing
And if I'm locked in the bing, a nigga not gonna sing
I got a lot of things on my mind, dollar signs, life on the line
What I write's so right for the time
The revelation like sight for the blind like when God cypher divine
Hand you lessons; or when you in the church havin' confession
Or when you kneelin on the pew, catchin the Holy Ghost
Or the cult, so fanatic they think suicide's the only hope (no)
They used to ask you ""Who ya master?"" Now they ask you ""Who your pastor?""
It's your allegiance that they truly after
They used to ask you ""Who ya master?"" Now they ask you ""Who your pastor?""
It's your allegiance that they truly after
That make you wanna go off B
But I step back and I let it roll off me
Brooklyn, New York B, ain't nothin' soft G
Yeah I get stressed but I let it roll off me
Talk the talk but to walk the walk is costly
Niggaz got on they +Game+ face like Black Wall Street
Every single move I make is ballsy
Cause the shit it used to be a, silent movie now it's a talky
The Feds cheesin like Milwaukee when shit is Brew-in
When these niggaz stage a coup for the president I'm a shoo-in
But, ain't no political aspirations I'm persuin
I hate to ruin your dream but music is what I'm doin'
I've touched more people in a verse than you do in 20 speeches
Whether state's blue like the water or redder than white people on sunny beaches
Sometimes I don't be understandin it
They looked at me and said that's why you the perfect candidate
Standin at the pulpit with a full clip
What I say real talk, turn around and walk away with your bullshit
I'm like breed, yo I ain't to be fucked with
Only write the realest, can't lie to the public
The sharp wick cut quick, killin' 'em softly
They try to take me there but you could never force me
Brooklyn, New York B, ain't nothin' soft G
Yeah I get stressed but I let it roll off me
Flirtin with the fame but I let it roll off me
They love it when I'm losin but I let it roll off me
Dirt on my name but I let it roll off me
Always keep it movin and I let it roll off me

Feel the rush
Feel the rush...
(Talib over the repeated line)
Yeah, I do this shit for real (you get Chuck D'd, ""Shut the Fuck down"")
Ain't no games being played (remember that, remember that)
It might be the career (yo)
It might be on the stage (yo)
It might be in the street (yo)
But the people come to me (why?)
(Talib Kweli)
They come to me for the lyrical, spiritual, raw shit I spit at you
Original, and I see collective, not individual
Visual, in the mic I'm un-fuck-wit-able
Invincible, official nigga who they come to
For the hardcore, art of war, rhymes that I got in store
Triple W in curo son or die or
For education and culture, heads is waitin' for Mos to
Do the album with Kweli, we do it like we suppose to
Nobody come close to my crew, we wild nice
You ain't tight, your rhymes is like what a child writes
When he can't spell, you chase crumbs and get ate like Han-sel
Can't hold your mic, like your liquor, your style like an Amstel
Smack a nigga till my motherfuckin hands swell
You ain't fly and you prolly got can-cell
Y'all niggas shaky like handheld, amuteur camera work
In walking this planet of earth
I'm the illest emcee and a man of my word
When I came out, niggaz didn't understand it at first
I'm known to roll up my sleeves and put my hands in the dirt
We at war and I got a battle plan that can work
With the proper execution so I'm killin' 'em right
You get hit like a deer standin' still in the light
I'm spillin' it like, I ain't never had a meal in my life
Feed my family with my pen, it's so real what I write
We fight, fuck, get buckwild
Kill, chill, make love, have child
Freestyle, b-boy, hit the block
Build, destroy, get it hot
Yo, I make the place go apeshit (c'mon)
Ain't no other way to say it, ain't nuttin to play with
I'm Langston Hughes, ""Dreams Deferred"" seen and heard in the flesh
Cause so many people believe the word even when it seems absurd
With keen observation I peep the game
And got blood on his hands, I can see the stains
My street slang spray like shots when heat bang out
Niggas keep my name in they mouth, I put they flame out
Where I'm from, action is first and talk is second
I'm sharp like the blade in the logo of Rawkus Records
New York's infected, niggaz beefin' on the mix-tape
Got Nickelback niggaz thinkin' they can fuck with big weight
Hell no, give it up, it's enough
We about to live it up, with ten of us
We ride and you live with us
Pick it up, party people, you about to get in touch
Give it up, everybody, you about to get a rush
You can find Kweli in the cut, wth a Cohiba lit up bout to split a Dutch
Get it up, everybody, you about to get in touch
Give it up, everybody, you about to get a rush (whooo!)
(Xzibit)
Yeah, yeah
Quality material
Yo, check this out
Yeah, you heard it

The lord chief rocker, I'm colder than meatlockers
My people keep throwin' it up like cheap vodka
I smack internet emcees and beat bloggers
You can see my black thought like 'Riq Trotter
It's deep - go ahead and sleep
They know in the street Kwe' gon flow on the beat proper
Composin' complete operas
Longer than a cigar that's godfather,
Tap into heart chakras I'm harder than gobstoppers
People comin' for the throne not knowin' the seat hotter
Than fish grease, criminal names on police blotters
You convinced me, I hit targets like top shottas
Out in the mideast like Muslims takin' Shahada
I'm sayin' makin' a profit a product of Reaganomics
Awake and I'm stayin' conscious to radio playin' garbage, yeah
Blacksmith Music, if you don't pay homage,
I'ma show you how we break an artist
That's a threat, I'm not makin' a promise
Speak to the people like Barak Obama
They worship like a black Madonna, c'mon
Niggas talk shit, but they ain't got skills
I'm the type of nigga to put lead in your grill
Number two pencil is sharper to bruise mentals, and
Beatin' in my chest is the heart of a true gentleman
Still spit right in your face
Fuck a Top 8, back up, gimme my space, you're not safe
Yeah, they say I'm back, but I ain't go nowhere though
Been here the whole time

Fuck with your man too, thinkin' I can't do what I plan to
Vet vandal, niggas are brand new
Ain't knew I was bad news? Look at the tattoos
Get ran through like you was fingers through Sassoon
Horror chick in the bathroom, off the backstage room
Shit you couldn't imagine, nigga I'll harass you
I'll Ras Kass you, soul on ice and body cast dude
Past due, Jean and Kwe the last two action heroes
Actually had the capacity to be the ones in a class of zeroes
Hip hop's not dead, it was on vacation
We back, we bask in the confrontation
You can ask me, have any conversation

We not fallin' for your trick 'cause your image is like a gimmick
Forget it, every rhyme is bitten, you like a mimic
I'm talkin' to the lord and I'm askin' him for forgiveness
Just for kickin' niggas out the club like Michael Richards
Yeah, I admit, I'm guilty, the way I spit is filthy
I keep it gritty, so they get it, they feel me, the flow
Is known for touchin' the soul of street hustlers
I speak in the language - you know I keep customers
The writing therapeutic, it's due to the pain and sufferin'
While these dudes get it confused and abuse the creative substance
I'm givin' you a contact high, my name buzzin
And I came in the game with nothin', stop frontin' nigga, talk shit now!
The year of the Blacksmith is not defined by any calendar
Just thought I'd remind all you challengers

Music courtesy of, Maurice 'Mo Betta' Brown
Mo Betta, makes it mo' better, yeah
Preacher's playing foul in the system now listen now
It's more hate in the religious now ain't it foul
Gotta be a better way to figure out
How to be a self savior plus help my niggaz out
These pigs playin' foul in the system now listen now
Every poor person is a nigga now
There's gotta be a better way to figure out
How to get this paper 'cause they lockin all my niggaz down
(Chace Infinite)
How do expect to live? Dealin' with savages is damagin
Somebody gotta lose although you play to win
You know these niggaz hate, despite the color of your face
When I say nigga I'm just speakin' on your mental state
Life ain't a game if it is I can't participate
Maybe I've changed but my mind is in a different state
Cause now it seems more like a plan
I'm strivin for perfection, so that's where I'll begin
Your tallies and peaks and valleys can't describe who I am
This music is therapeutic, I define who I am
Through the actions I portray as a man - in combination
With impressions I leave on people through things that I've said
I've had it up to here with the bullshit
So when I rap I sound like I'm in the pulpit
Yeah; they say that I be preachin too much
But I know that through the music's how you teach it to us
It's all real
Preacher's playing foul in the system now listen now
It's more hate in the religious now ain't it foul

How to get this paper 'cause they lockin all my niggaz down

True indeed Chace; they tried to get rid of me (say word)
But they can't write me off, I'm not a charity
That's a parody right? You kiddin me
There really ain't no challenge, my authenticity
Virtually guarantee me a flawless victory, you kiddin me?
I'm lethal, I'm from a people who was forced into captivity
Original man, there was often a facsimile
I give a little more than your metaphors and wack similes
Thousand yard stare, say a prayer for my enemy
I'm international, half of these rappers laughable
It's tragic how the other half so vaginal
They put the style over substance, they counsel bother me
My style married my substance and now they livin' in harmony
But any substance can be abused
Especially when the style is so seductive the substance consider leaving you
You gotta get back to your essence
Use your gifts and share your presence
Don't count your dollars till you count your blessings
Preacher's playing foul in the system now listen now
It's more hate in the religious now ain't it foul
Gotta be a better way to figure out
How to be a self savior plus help my niggaz out

Rhymes are bright, the sunshine beams through it
Stop haters in their tracks like high beams
Like the moment you was at the crime scene screaming ""I ain't do it""
But, I seen through it, it's obscene how I spew it
Martin Luther King had a dream to it, people cling to it
I seen your momma lean to it in a green Buick
Wack niggas get passed over so much they seem Jewish
Better leave and do it now or seem foolish
This music I bleed to it, I raise my seeds to it
I MC with the truest in the game
I stay hungry like I'm the newest in the game
And stay hot like I'm bluish with the flame

Cats taking Vicodin pills to numb the pain that they feeling
Pertaining to stealing my rhymes finding their brains on the ceiling
I'm blowing their minds wide open when I'm flowing I'm fine
Hey yo my whole style banging like I'm throwing up signs
Niggas get cut like I saw someone I know in the line
I live life to the fullest 'cause I know I could die
Right now, I don't believe I know when to sto'
My face soldier's going to lie, when I'm going to buy
You gonna see a rainbow in the sky
And my momma's face glowing with pride
My first born held it down and through my baby's soul I survive
Put your hands in the air and let me know you're alive

This the soundtrack (In the natural sound)
Do not be alarmed (Children playin')
Don't panic, be calm, yeah... (Crickets chirpin')
We gon' hit you with... with the words
We gon' hit you with the music (We in Fort Greene right now)
'Course we gonna hit you with that Kweli shit
One of these days a change gon' come
For you and I and our children
Where you can live and just have fun
Don't nobody trip on where you come from
Everything is good yeah it's all love
It's freedom in the hood for all to get some
It's every woman to a man
To a child to a fam
With all us on a higher level of understanding
But if it's gonna take a while I'll chill
I can bask in the glory on that day
And if I gotta chill then boy I will
It's no problem for me because yo I be
B-Boy position standing here
Anticipatin' patiently just waitin'
To grind out for my dream
And you (you) can't stop me boy
(HOOK: Musiq)
Listen...
Ladies and gentlemen don't be alarmed
This is the soundtracks of what's goin' on
And if you want you can get it
I promise you if you let it
The rhythm'll be good to you
Yeah, let the rhythm be good to you
I promise baby it'll be so good to you
And now, you 'bout to witness the sound
Of these Words, Musiq, and Kweli
Community blocks waitin' till my opportunity knocks
But the door is usually locked because it's usually cops
Most of wish we had a car and jewelry shop
But spend my days tryin'a fuck or find a movie to watch
Talkin' big plans to live large and move from the block
Your only option from your moms is to move to ya pops
Cigarettes tryin'a hold on to the few that you got
Price is crazy high for you to give up a loosies a lot
Areas we from you scared you don't run
Don't care what you've done
Be wary of tongue snitchin' 'n' hope the jury is hung
Tryin' to go from zero to one like a hero becomes
While here air in my lungs ideas I share with my sons
People down here so shady they could stare at the sun
Can't wait till that unemployment check clear once it comes
Daily routine, but my only theory when young
Was get money, get a job and hope her period comes... it's real life
Walkin' the block at night I, stopped at rhyme cypha
Circle of rhyme writers broken up crime fighters
They said we loiterin' started orderin' us around
We ain't jump at the sound of they voice,
They said ""Get on the ground!""
This 'cause we black or what?
I'm sick of cops harassin' us
Probably because we ain't degrade ourselves fast enough
The people passin' us stopped 'n' the cops start actin' right
Somebody had my back tonight
Off they go in a flash of light
You try to see the future take a mental picture of it
City life is hard when your apartment don't fit in your budget
You need to get a room like people who kiss in public
Plus you tempted to say ""Fuck it"" until you kick the bucket
There's more to life than appears it ain't no crystal stair
As nails'll stick out 'n' snare you and this is crystal clear
Ain't no officials in chairs or fans that scream your name
It ain't a game but it's still a challenge just the same
But if it's gonna take a while I'll chill
I can bask in the glory on that day
And if I gotta chill then boy I will
It's no problem for me because yo I be
B-Boy position standing here
Anticipatin' patiently just waitin'
To grind out for my dream
And you (you) can't stop me boy"
90,So Low,2011,Gutter Rainbows (2011),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me
And I've been so low
I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low get low but you never been as low as me
I always speak for the struggle my people still hurting
I'm a name brand I'm a product but still a real person
I'm still flirting with death although I'm still certain
About my commitments in life although I'm still searching
I bet I find a way if not I bet I make a path
One that's seldom traveled by the masses
I never stuck in all the traffic I cut through all the plastic
Enemies of the enlightened like the government is fascist
I talk it how I live it yet I'm still considered a walking contradiction
'Cause I'm breaking out of your artistic prison listen
I got my own demons what I'm supposed to do with yours
Times like this I gotta remind myself what I do It for
People I knew before celebrity swear they see the change in me
I tell 'em change is god you gotta let it be
How does it feel to come full circle
Still cursing still pursing my lips to pull purple but
I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me
And I've been so low
I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low get low but you never been as low as me
Witness it the building of a legacy
So let us just pray cause the journey that's ahead of us
Got us facing a task that just might get the best of us
That's why we gotta clash with the Titans like Pegasus
No Oedipus but it's like the beat is my therapist
When I let it in it get up in the cracks and the crevices
Of my memories what kind of treasure are you buried with
You fight when you die are you a soldier or a terrorist
Remember this there's no one else to blame when you're solo
Establish your fan base local before you take it global
Don't be scared spend your own dough
You gotta speak up be vocal sometimes you feel so low
Ain't nowhere to go but up go with us
We just getting started why you slowing up
But know enough to know by a collective we
Even if my name is on the record sleeve I ain't into brevity
What the fuck is a celebrity
I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burning as it swirls around me
And I've been so low
I felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low get low but you never been as low as me"

To the break of dawn
5 o'clock in the morning
We keep rockin' on
The workin people runnin' like the stop clock is on
We got it poppin' in the meat market
Chicks take a seat, park it
By the bar so they can meet the Vick with deep pockets
And them doods
By them cars that turn 'em in to sweet objects
Of desire
Big rims and them tires
We finna drop it like it's heavy as hell
The clan of the cavebear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air
Come through like the cable guy
Get 'er done
That 'ole hit 'n' run
Turn into bitter ones

You can taste the ginger bread
Ain't nothing like wakin' up with a stranger in yur bed

Shorty paint her face like a clown but can't take away the frown

Gotta get it in. I'm slippin in the darkness like most of the day is gone
We up all night I wonder if can hang
We used to hang from a tree
Now we hangin' behind the rope we V.I.P.
We do it
B.I.G.
Ain't no need to See I.D.
Thee entire scenery
Shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery
Six girls to every three doods
So you have half a chance
If you ask to have a dance
The ones ready to freak off don't need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them
Hungry eyes you know sensual trance
At a glance
The alcohol got you sexually advanced
The truth is so boring you gotta pretend a little; the antidote is more colorful the rainbow and the Skittles
And the quest to trap the cat
The game is the Tinder Fiddles to get the bruce to say the sky's fallin' like your Chicken Little. Come on!

So beware we keep the lights on

Right on
Riding the light so you see in the dark
So deep you gotta be still like your beating heart
My words apply the pressure to make the bleeding stop
See the art, living right, eating smart
I wanna right to life, a right to death
Police read your rights from right to left
But I never write to remain silent
I fight through police line
Cops walk the beat that I write to
I teach minds, write rhymes with the right sound
Right now, journalists write up
I write down

Grab a cloud and squeeze till no man is dry

Talking to elders and taking advice
Ignoring their words and paying the price
Living in the world where false preachers got us praying to Christ
Get with the young girls in the choir and laying the pipe
No control of our soul we all wait at the light
So comfortable they we hating to fight to make it right
Late at night I'm controlled by the DJ on the mic
I love hip-hop and every joint he playing is tight
A day in the life is a brick in the foundation of like
A maze in Egypt amazing when I'm creating a sight
For the world to behold and the story to last
So one day ghetto children can visit their glorious past

From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
From the top, from the top, from the top, from the top
In a state of grace
Where the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence
So the selling never safe
At the same time snitching to the Jake
Is the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake
But the problem we face seems so great
That we can't escape so we accept our fate
So the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint
If an artist is a part of a community
And got an opportunity to get that cake
Would never come back to the hood, no immunity
Usually a nigga like that so fake, no different from a snake
Nothing left to give cause you always wanna take
If you ain't using all the talents God provided you with
For the betterment of man, understand you ain't nothing but a waste
Look into the face of a young girl
Raising up like a flag when it's unfurled
Got game listening to her mother's pearls
And she love Beyonce 'cause she run the world
Her mama used to run this city
Way back before the nigga Puff was Diddy
When it came to the music then she got real picky
From New York, but preferred 2Pac over Biggie
No disrespect to Ms. Wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge
And she felt that Pac was more lyrical
Plus she never went to college
But she called herself 'Earth' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual
She God in the physical
And it's only natural to pray for a little you
Musical so she played the umbilical chords
So her daughter was born it was a miracle
Music is the light when it's dark
And the way that you spit your dart is a big part
She grew up loving hip hop
Now all her daughter got is ""Love and Hip Hop""
Nowadays niggas turn up for the sex
Niggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement
Ratchet reality stars that be looking so stupid
Getting in the fights at reunions
She used to be inspired by the writers, now she's tired of the biters
No desire for the lying and the violence
That's inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment
Her body is politics
Lost count of how many whores she was called today
She won't do it no more, lost all her faith
They say she exaggerate when she hollerate
But it's only so much she can tolerate

No objections, being an object, major label seeing a profit
She ain't never been a bitch or a ho
But she used to sing along when she heard it in a song
She used to be front row at the shows till she overdosed on the testosterone
Her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed
But she felt like she really ain't belong
When she wouldn't let him hit, this nigga called her a bitch
She erased all her songs from the phone
You are who you fuck with, so the guy that she stuck with
You can bump it or dump it, the artist she trusted
Just broke her heart, so misogynistic and disgusting
She tried not to judge him, in her heart she still loved him
And the way that he lusting, a part of his suffering
And this young man, clearly not ready for the harder discussion
Female emcees acting more like a dude than a dude do, only if you knew
I know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo
But she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude
Taking cues from the radio playing that doodoo
She on D'Angelo Pandora station playing that Voodoo, who knew?

In the face of hate
She'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great
I see lyrics as colors and shapes
Put it on tape, let her know I could relate
When you wish you could switch the way that you look
And your nose was smaller and your hair was straight
When you got no faith
When you hate yourself, when you hate your race
Let's get to the core
Our sisters worth more than grinding on the wall half-naked
She a bitch, she a whore
And you rich and you shit on the poor
In all of your records and ask 'em to buy it
Why should I support music that constantly disrespects me?
And make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left
With the charge of repping it correctly
When it's free online or in a cloud
Ain't no reason to touch the radio dial
You wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air
And it's clear that your sales going down
Down by law then you found the raw
On a message board and you sounding off
These niggas get the whole world, but what's the cause?
No wonder why these niggas be sounding lost
Rhyming is a memory
The assembly line rap niggas is designed by the enemy
Stop giving them your soul, gift wrap
Prepackaged, fabricated shit rap
Running through you like fast food - Big Mac's

All the time that you spent listening to that bullshit
Now you ain't never gon' get back

But baby won't you stay around with me?...
And let my love (and let my love)
And let my love
Kweli you should rap about this, you should rap about that
Any more suggestions? You in the back, yeah you
You should rap more on beat, you should rap more street
And never ever get your mack on please, how 'bout you?
I like the way you're melodic, it's cause you capture hypnotic
Portraits and seem to make the average exotic
Probably unite, I know you getting some love, but you can't spit like a thug
And you a blow, you make a hit for the club, word
I don't like your voice, I don't like your choice of beats
It sounds like it's forced, and what was up with ""Back Up Offa Me""?
I ain't like that, man you should get with Hi-Tek
Now he got nice tracks, them other dudes is type wack
Yeah, people keeping it coming, I keep it bubbling
Like the heat from oven boiling the water and the hate
So they light my fire...
I got a mic empire, my own label
I had to emancipate me-me like Mariah...
At some point I might retire, on some bullshit
My legacy, horseshit like Mariah's...
Illest flow found in the game, soothing like the sound of the rain
It's the dude profound with the fame, I refusing to be sounding the same
Keeping the verses, deleting the curses, defeating the purpose
When the people go on strike, I'm in the street with the workers
Speaking the words from a pulpit like the preachers at churches
Raise my hand, all the teachers get nervous
'Cause they know I air them out
And they ain't even really gotta hear me out
Keep it dirty like pigpen, voice in the warrior's head like Lynne Thigpen
Clocking like Big Ben, old school slang still find a way to innovate

But baby won't you stay around with me?...
And let my love (and let my love)
And let my love
Light the tip of the L, this heavyweight rap tipping the scale
And we never let the system prevail, real picturesque, missing the sale
Never that, it's forbidden like the candy sisters lifting the veil
I'm still leading the pack, these cats lacking
Just because you be having a dragon don't mean you got the fire...
It ain't nothing to play with, it's sacred
My pen is the paintbrush, and dipping in paint plus
Truth, love, joy, anger, hatred and anguish
That's the spectrum of colours I paint with
I don't feast at the banquet, cause freedom is the set that I bang with
Listen the conditions in my slum village is tainted
I grew through the pavement, like the flower the girl drew in the paper
The sky bluer and the? eye's? save you
The rules of engagement that they use, attitudes of a slave
Man got me stressed out losing my patience
The moves that I'm making across waters
Through contraband that I'm taking across borders
Information never lost in translation
Too many new words to be learned, I'm spitting fire giving third degree burns
Giving them heat stroke, hotter than rocking a P cote

Cold caves or peaks of high

We the New Era you just a Starter cap
Find out what happens when the artist in tact
Be sharp as a tack, fall back you smarter than that
Or perhaps you just ain't as smart as you think

Terra Firma ain't as hard as you think
Stare down, and you starting to blink

What is oozing out of our ground
That allows this type of effect to happen?
It's not just around our sun and our moon any more
Everywhere we look, the visible spectrum, is rainbows
This can not be natural
We as a nation have got to ask ourselves
What the hell is going on?
What is oozing out of our ground?
The day that I enlisted
Was the result of a prior visit with Jesus Christ felt like I was lifted
Then I got injured and the hospital was like a prison
Fell out of touch with my faith I was nihilistic
They call me Cyclops, 'cause I was blind in one eye
I'm out the army now I'm tryin' to decide
How to properly fit in with civilians I'm used to killin'
Got me feelin' all confused who the hero and who the villain
Hopped in my red Camaro, shot down the street like lead in a barrel
Decked out in my veteran apparel
I drove aimlessly for miles until I saw this
Country that'd want me to kill; I took a bullet for this muh'fucker
Thousand miles later finally made a stop
Small town restaurant, God damn the waitress hot
Ordered tater tots, got her number, later that night
We was at the bar, takin' shots till we fell in love
I said let's go Las Vegas and do this
Knew this wasn't made for my soul
Drove all night and was awakened to cold
She wanna play the slots, nicknamed her Tater Tot
Cause of how we met, cool I need a shower, bet
Found a motel on the strip, I'm checkin' in
When out the blue some Mexicans came in the lobby like they 'bout to shoot
Some Asians that was runnin' down the hall with they guns brazen
Now e'rybody pullin out they shit like it's an invasion!
The Mexicans let them Asians have it; Asians had to fire back
Till they was outta bullets and the blood splattered everywhere
Deal gone bad or somebody robbin
Either way somebody's rotten all I hear is bodies droppin'
I jump behind the front desk in the nick of time
The crook is on the floor, his blood made me slip and slide
But I'm the last man standin
A reflex made me grab a cannon out a dyin' man's hand
Then I noticed that a car was runnin'
Sack of guns on the floor plus unmarked bills by the hundreds
Driver comin' at me gunnin
Sirens blarin in the distance cause the caps are comin'
I spun around and I hit the deck
Heard the bullets whiz by my ear I let off, hit him in the chest
Quicker than the bullets left the chamber
I grabbed the sack off the floor hit the door with the bangers
Lookin' for my lady at the casino, she was in the zone
I said ""We gotta go"" she like ""Why?"" and I'm like ""C'MON!""
No need to gamble baby, here the lick
Put the chips down we gotta go right now, this little shit
Now we speedin down the I-15
First time I noticed that her eyes were green
Gave her a gun and a magazine
I made her count the loot
But when she saw the score she pointed the gun at me
Now she about to shoot {blam, blam blam}"

To the Feds who put a price on the side of head of Cuba, B
Protectin' the property value over the people life
To take action against a foul government is the people right
But not too many ready to fight
It's like you'd rather be at home watchin' a flick or a fight
Or maybe Nick-At-Night
It's sick how I'm addicted to mics, become a flickerin' light
After I spark I'm always ready to write
Where I'm from, they be watchin' us, but we be watchin' them
And bust shots till the coppers bring the choppers in
The squad cars try to box me in
But I got knowledge of self and it's stronger than any cage you can lock me in
(Talib Kweli)
When them boys wit the Tec's throwin' up they set
And the spot so hot the ceilin' start to sweat
Yeah, that's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The...
When you just a little tipsy, you lookin' at them lips
And you lockin' up them hips, get the drillin' wit the tips, and
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out
That's when The Beast come out

A lot of different Beasts or demons roamin' the planet
And they surface at any given time
You never know when they can surface and come right up out of you
No matter how righteous you think you are
Situation could go down when you forced
To let The Beast out"

Force the hand this is Strong Arm feeding you
We're beating you, cut a nigga short like an interlude

With my east coast, polly, Kweli, you got a problem with me
Steady Gang running the game, it won't change
Back to the days with Jordan's and gold chains
Fistful of dollars fucking future top models
Through the knowledge but we still poppin' bottles
Pushing like full throttle on the Interstate trunk full
Of product just to make a nigga's dinner plate
Gotta get this money for my daughter's sake, and I
Smoke a lot of weed and plus a nigga gotta say (what)
Fresher than a motherfuckin' mannequin, you get
The point like we was playing pickle with a couple javelins
Gimme a reason to stop speaking and
Start niggas bleedin' in the mid Los Angeles region
We the niggas that believe in lacerations and lesions
Niggas wanna dick and get it this evenin'
Earn a song James Lionel grain greedy geniuses
Y'all niggas is mysteries nothin' but phantom menaces
And we the niggas y'all love to hate
But see the homies from the east just raise the stakes
And we gonna get it in a major way
Blacksmith is the label strong arm is the game
Shawshank charmaleon six pack benatall [?]
Weeping in the bank watching Robin Hood withdraw
Young orangutan gettin' niggas knocked off
You hall ass and get a trip to see Lou Rawls
I pour Henny from jewelry in my jacket like linen
You don't think I got the hustle in me
Roll with the real resis' you retarded
And winky is not the shit he just farted
One trip you motionless you understand the kid got close
And we can get rich, the rice stay broke
King Tut chrome in the cut like macuricone
Take off your head like the N.O. Superdome
The blacker the better, the greener the cheddar

Yeah I know a city that's surrounded by a beautiful beach
The economy boosted by the drugs they move in the street
More clearer than the crystal sky, blue as the beast
The people ain't got shoes for they feet, or food to eat
So they hurtin' but what's for certain you can get you some heat
And over beef you laid to rest like you was gettin' some sleep
Where the little kids get ammunition (word) you can't get no nutrition
Or any type of suitable living condition listen
They shoot you over that paper, its just survivalist human nature
To put you out of your misery like euthanasia (yeah)
Don't let them fool you we ain't different than the youth in Asia
Africa and Europe, it's a small world we truly neighbors
If they the third world then who the first to get to heaven
I know it's hard but who does God choose to go through it worst
Usually it's the prophets, ask a cat what really matters
Nowadays usually it's his pockets

Take my music like a drug and drop the needle in the same vein
I get a rush like I'm tweekin off blow
Except it ain't via the nose it's from deep in my soul
The street slang I be speakin' in code
Kick in the do's, freakin the flow till the speakers explode
We in control, the people know I speak the truth
The power of my roots is thicker than sour sop
And they so strong they bustin' out the flower pot
Family tradition is to tell 'em you love 'em

We got beats to the rhyme and the rhyme is so fresh yo
So what'chu got? 9's and tecs, you no threat
It's the beat, how you get your cake don't matter
It takes heart the lyrics been replaced with the swagger
I stay sharp enough to slash your face like a dagger
The actors been replaced with the rappers
The rappers been replaced with the actors, see how they try to stay on the beat
The pig route when he walkin' down the street to the beat
(KRS-One)
WOOP~! Sound of da police
What is the life of a true hip-hopper, the beats
Peace love unity livin' proper with the beats
In any endeavor whatever we will prosper with our beats
Some cats are real, other are impostors with beats
We the realest, livest
The rawest, crack cocaine heroin survivors with beats
We avoided the cops, we focused on beefs
Spittin', all we saw was stacks of rhymes written, elite
Way too smart for the system of course
We know a smart free black man just pisses 'em off!
What they like is when we glisten and gloss
Flashin millions but still takin' a loss
Bump the beat! Yeah, all in the street
Talib yo, I think it's 'bout time to speak
(Talib Kweli)
Yeah... yeah... word~!
Watch me take it there, life ain't no Christmas there
Hell yeah it's crystal clear when Kweli and Kris is here
Searching for the perfect beat I went to East Dayt'
It's crazy and fugazi how they slaves to they release date
They try to look away, they're scared to look inside
Askin why like a guy who look for God up in the sky (that's right)
Searchin high and low, behind the do', inside the drawer
Little did he know that the beat was tryin' to find a flow
Stuck in limbo, how low can you go
A punched hole through your stomach lining like Tylenol
Build all kind of rolled, metaphors and similies
That'll have you doubtin my competitor's abilities
My whole body is a spiritual facility
Rock a vest after a lyrical killing spree
The illest delivery, later for the talk we need action
Silence is golden but the violence is platinum
When you rappin' to the beat
(KRS-One)
Boom, bap, who's, that?
KRS-One bring the beat back
The perfect beat we seek that, knowledge of mind we speak that
We don't speak weak crap over weak tracks
MOVE, THAT; we speak boom bap live in the club
We can show and prove that
(Talib Kweli)
Yeah, it ain't old school or new school it's true school rap
Beat you till you're blue and black, true dat, it's
(KRS-One)
Better beat win again, work the street
Movin again, insert the heat
Lookin' again for the perfect beat
Don't look in the book to learn to eat
Write up a hook, learn to speak
Never be shook, follow the heat
Forever they look weak
T.K. you must speak!
(Talib Kweli)
Teachin 'em how to eat to live
They cheap and their pimp is pleadin the fifth
Bleedin as if they goin' to war
Everytime they leavin' the crib
Sneakers and whips, police be peepin the strip
You see 'em walkin' the beat
Hoes believin the pimps who eatin the shrimps
So John's walkin' the street
Lookin' for a sweet face, in each case
Tryin' to get they heartbeat racin, and the dark meat be tastin
So delicious, my description so good to the beat
It's lifted right from the sounds that you hear in the hood when you sleep
(KRS-One)
Bring the beat back!
All that whackness, we don't need that
You gotta bring the beat back!
All that whack garbage, we don't need that

Timothy McVeigh is executed
And the country breathe a sigh of relief
Goodness prevails over evil, it seems
Somehow when he's gone, we feel safer
Little do we know
Today the paper say Timothy McVeigh's in hell
So everything's okay and all must be well
I remember in Oklahoma when they put out the blaze
And put Islamic terrorist bombing, on the front page
It's like saying only gays get AIDS, propaganda
Like saying the problem's over when they locked that man up
Wrong! It's just the beginning, the first inning
Battle for America's soul, the devil's winning
The President is Bush, the Vice President's a Dick
So a whole lot of fuckin' is what we gon' get
They don't wanna raise the babies so the election is fixed
That's why we don't be fuckin' with politics
They bet on that, parents fought and got wet for that
Hosed down, bit by dogs, and got blacks into house arrest for that
It's all good except for that - we still poor
Money, power and respect is what we kill for, for real
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride

A drunken police officer mows down an entire family in Brooklyn
The judge lets him go with no bail
It reminds us, of just how worthless our lives are to the justice system
I struggle, to explain the situation to my son, it's hard
Niggaz with knowledge is more dangerous than than niggaz with guns
They make the guns easy to get and try to keep niggaz dumb
Target the gangs and graffiti with the Prop 21
I already know the deal but what the fuck do I tell my son?
I want him livin' right, livin' good, respect the rules
He's five years old and he still thinkin' cops is cool
How do I break the news that when he gets some size
He'll be perceived as a threat or see the fear in they eyes
It's in they job description to terminate the threat
So 41 shots to the body is what he can expect
The precedent is set, don't matter if he follow the law
How do I give my son pride and make him swallow it all (damn!)
Fuck the pigs! I think the pigs killed Big and 'Pac too
If they didn't they know who did, they got to!
Who they serve and protect, nigga not you
Cops shot off of ten G's but they got glocks too
Let you protect yourself, or better yet respect yourself
Straight into the hospital is where you gotta check yourself
They be gettin' tips from snitches and rival crews
Doin' them favors so they workin for the drug dealers too
Just business enforcers with hate in they holsters
Shoot you in the back, won't face you like a soldier
Kurt Loder asked me what I say to a dead cop's wife
Cops kill my people everyday, that's life
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
September 11, 2001
Terrorists attack the Pentagon and the World Trade Center
Kills thousand and permanently scars America's false sense of security
We see the best examples of humanity in the face of the worst
As fire fighters, police officers, rescue workers
And volunteers of all sorts, fight to save lives
The world will never be the same again
My heart go out to everybody at Ground Zero
Red, black, yellow, white and brown heroes
It's more complicated than black and white
To give your own life is the greatest sacrifice
But it's hard for me to walk down the block
Seeing rats and roaches, crack viles and 40 ounce posters
People broken down from years of oppression
Become patriots when they way of life is threatened
It's a hard conversation to have
We lost kids, moms and dads, people ready to fight for the flag
Damn, when did shit get this bad?
America kill the innocent too, the cycle of violence is sad
Damn! Welcome to the world, we here
We've been at, war for years but it's much more clear (yeah)
We got to face what lies ahead
Fight for our truth and freedom and, ride for the dead
We survive, it's more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than pride

They seen your lovedaddy in the bulletproof blue Coupe
My rhymes is full of truth, and the business full of lies
Try to look a Masai kid in his eyes for the flies
And tell him how he fucked up our environment daily
The only thing we know about Africa is from Nas or Belly
But go off like a Hutu or Tutsi, from Rwanda or Burundi
Over drums like Babatunde Olatunji
Sayin' nigga just to keep our teeth white, like Paul Mooney
Fightin spiritual wars, like the Shi'ite or the Sunni

Yeah, welcome to the show, it's Talib Kweli, so amazin
Live from California it's the Madlib invasion, let's GO~!
This exercise in freedom is called the ""Liberation""
I keep it fly by a process of elimination
When it come to payin' the kid, sometimes it's hesitation
Till I make 'em check it in like they got reservations
But there ain't no reservations about coppin this
Even though it's free for the people there ain't no stoppin' this
Poppin' fresh, cakin up, I'm breakin up the, monotonous flow
That can't write or plant life like a botanist grow
A new crop and just roll, it up, blow it out whoa

I am a follower of the freestyle fellowship them niggas knew their stuff
I'm a student of?
Long pieces of Jupiter
Nowadays rappers are stupider
Swearing to god that they blew up

Then I'm like, show me the proof right?
Niggas start talking about the anti-Christ and aliens and shit
Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga, I'm a grown ass man
Let's go, let's go
You can lead a man to a drink
But you can't make him take a sip
You can lead a man to a link
But that don't mean he gonn' click
What's this? Y'all ain't really on no deep shit
I peeped it, scared of a motherfuckin' secret
Society and only bein' with people you agree with
You scared of a chalice scared of death
Only thing worse is your silence
Illuminatis enlightened, the OWL see in the darkness
Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
Egyptologist and scholars
Symbologists at the college
Will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started
Way farther back than the knights
Or the Rite of the Scottish
You need to wake up, no new Bugatti
My enemy tryna stop me but I don't stand a chance
If I can't identify 'em properly
Illuminati as we know it started in Bavaria
Years before it landed on the shores of America
The mission: abolishment of government and religion
They were enemys of the state
And they was hated by the Christians
They was Poets, they was Scholars
Early Illuminati was sorta like the students
In Victor Hugo's Les Miserables
The modern day politicians would diss 'em
Turning them into martyrs
This in turn inspired the founding fathers
The vast majority Masons who were the subject of the Illuminati
Found this fascination the order was insipiration
And ain't no disrespect to the masons
But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
Only those in league with Satan need to hide information
That's how you catch a ride to your final destination
Where the proof, show 'em proof put it all on the table
When the facts are intact ain't no need for a fable
Good versus evil is primitive
Real life's more complex, what's your context?
They put the symbols on the dollar bill, the monument, the obelisk
They honouring Columbia the children of the colonists
You can trace it back to the root trace it back again
It's really just another case of stealin' from the African
Racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh
You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh?
Population control is real, you know the deal
But still perpetuate the cycle of violence
We known to hold the steel
No, I don't need no fuckin' chorus
Used to read so many books
Thought I was a hoarder down at Borders
Like Behold the Pale Horse or The New World Order
But you really don't know what you reading
If you really don't know the author
A lot of Satan worship is just government propaganda
Unsubstantiated lies with no proof a bunch of slander
Of course there are forces against you and that's a fact
Don't get caught in the distraction, it's bigger than any rapper
The truly oppressed ain't got the luxury of inventing a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
What they doing so sinister
Worse than any blood sacrifice you can imagine
Iller than any cinema
The Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the IMF
Helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath
Food, vaccines, humanitarian aid
They want control of the region, they really tryna get paid
Obey thy consumer make a product out of man
Where's the conspiracy? It's always been the plan
Y'all niggas scared of one world currency
But still paying your taxes
It ain't the Illuminati that worry me
Lack of spiritual energy, suicidal tendencies
Unwitting soldiers in the armies of the enemy
I'm leaking information so follow me down the wormhole
Same reason that they called Bradley Manning a turncoat
(Man, we supposed to be brothas!)
Oh what you tryna get smart?
Nigga you tryna kick some knowledge?
Nigga fuck that give me your muthafuckin jewelry nigga
Take that shit off
Oh you got a pager too huh?

It's like I'm jokin, I get 'em open like multiple lines are snorted
They snortin I'm spittin' flames; nigga the flow'll blowtorch ya
I'm on fire so they always try to put me out
Flatbush all day but they don't know what my hood about
I'm so good without your props and accolades
Crackin' like whips on the back of slaves, spittin' on the master's grave
I'm tighter than 'yette's braids, y'all niggaz are ""Tenderheaded""
Just 'cause I ain't you as my friend yet, then forget it
SHEESH~! Y'all niggaz are sensitive
That's really me on that shit, not a representative
Nuttin pretend or fake, many came and went, tryin' to imitate
That's the quickest way to disintegrate
It's 'cause I innovate, my shit hardly assimilate
Still I'm bringin' ""SexyBack"" like Timbaland and Timberlake
I don't stop, I never hesitate
Plus it don't start till I arrive and so I'm never late
The time is right get it straight
The time is right get it straight... c'mon!
I'm so slick it's slide when you ride with it
Like the Y kitted, do or die with it like the Stuy in it
Fly with it, +Do or Die+ with like the Chi in it
Live the life of Riley like my nigga from Guy, shit..."

Where there's nothing but cash inside my hand
Wanna dig into my pocket my profit is ever set
I dig deeper, you know I represent, represent
Yeah, money over bitches, my sisters go over everything
My bandz will make you dance forever, just like a wedding ring
Barb of the haters, the jealousy that the cheddar bring
Trying to get away from this 85's like Evelyn
Ride with me, I got 'em leaking like Nene
Got 'em leaking like Mickey, these monkeys biting like hickeys
'Cause they're seeing what I'm doing, filling them with confusion
Cut edges like a chewing, I'm flowing just like a student
Of the romance languages, only the diamonds hang with us
My meal is decorated with garnish just like your wages is
The crib's outrageous like really it's no joke
The girl of your dreams be coming over to smoke
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people
You can feel the heat from your speaker, my sound will darken your features
Run it down like a zebra, I move with the speed of cheetahs
I'm from Brooklyn where the heat is the size of a two-litre
I ain't asking for no followers, I'm looking for new leaders
Is hard not consuming all the bullshit they feed us
Intravenous like a cord to the womb from the fetus
Been hard since I started reading, alliteration is literally littered
Through my DNA swimming on through my semen
So every time I bust, babies begin being born
Talk turns tough till them toasters that's tucked, yeah
Draw it like a picture, picture a perfect painting
Police profiling people peacefully praying
Lay the law like leadears the lazy as lolly
Gagging on my ground, getting guap cause green is the new black
Meet me at the bar, we throwing a few back
Hopped out the car, you know who blew that
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people
Ayo we drink good, smoke good
This cat wearing funny hats like the pope wore
I come in looking quite clean in the loafer
So hood, might scheme up to no good
You know crook got sling in the notebook
I got the birds on the wire like I know I would
I still rep POC's like I'm supposed to
Come alive and down throw like I know I should
My rhymes like a laser beam - so focused
I'm in the ring so lean I need a phone?
I ain't lying, Batista Ferocious
Maybe I'm lying bare feet in the ocean
On the beach fall asleep and I'm floating
To the beat so unique like a potion
I love music, I'm complete in my devotion
(Word, say it again)
I'm complete in my devotion
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Turn it up loud, turn it up loud
Drop it, stop it
With all the soap operas and the soap boxes
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people"

Know how I do
Maybe you don't (All you have to do is call me... call me)
Why you playing, why you playing?
I be going like two and two
With some hot shit ready to spit for you
With the songs that you love just to get you through
Back in effect
I'm back to collect
Got the respect
Which will turn into the cash or a check
You can, pay me in fear, you can pay me with love
You can, pay me in tears or you can pay me in blood
Spray me with slugs, and the revolution live, I never die in vain
The writer might be dead but the piece remain on the train (yeah)
The music help you be true to yourself, accumulate wealth
So what I spit is the embodiment I do for self
As a teen it was kinda hard to find a job
I took over my writer's bloc and ran it like a spot
I'm Pimp C in this game nigga, I'm a hard
But I'm never feasting on it, keep speaking on it God
That's what they say when I'm building, I keep my dialogue street
But still spiritual like we deep inside a mosque
Or the sin of God that don't preach or go where the sinners are
And keep the fire burning like a slum lord in the Bronx
Of course I will 'cause you know how I do
Maybe you don't (All you have to do is call me... call me)

Ma
Rhyme writer from nine to five
It's the 25 to lifers with the balance of the acrobatic high wires
The pain of the slave with his back feeling like fire
'Cause the whip talking to his ass like Knight Rider
Most of these rappers now days be sounding like liars
Got visions of guns in they head like the Pied Piper
When I bust they start to disappear like my lighters
'Cause they shit is faker than the dreads on Mikah Phifer
The industry is in trouble
Plus these industry niggaz is fake, so they tend to be in a bubble
So I hit the block where they're known to thicken the plot
Sticking up cops, kids be pocket-picking they Glocks (my man)
Balling outta control, don't be forgetting that niggaz is broker than dishes at a Greek wedding
They might try to run up on you, take your life quick
It's like this when you walk the strip up on the night shift
Let 'em know
Of course I will 'cause you know how I do
Maybe you don't (All you have to do is call me... call me)
I be going like two and two
With some more hot shit ready to spit for you
With the songs that you love to get you through
Ma
This right here the bare essentials with no extras y'all
I kept it raw from the school of thought where less is more
Brooklyn is cooking and I blessed it with the special sauce
I got the soul of a prophet and never take a loss
Fresher than kicks out the box, the kids on the block
That is street hungry trying to get that sweet honey out the rock
Crack in the socks when they click the row thicker than sour sop
Listening to my black power rock
Music, of this hip hop we be rock to it
I'm a river, you a valley, watch me run right through it
You wanna learn how to do it, tell the truth in your single first
Lil' Kim went to jail for what you do in every single verse (free Lil' Kim)
Lyrics is perjury, your beats is more plastic than surgery
And we in the United States of emergency
One of the main reasons none of you lames worry me
Is I change lanes like a changed plane that change currency
They wanna know, tell them (All you have to do is call me)
Of course I will 'cause you know how I do
Maybe you don't (All you have to do is call me... call me)

Mike Tyson face tatted addict, like it tough
Hey scatterbrain, don't get your grey matter punched up
Till you hunched, talk-talkin' like you punch drunk
One love - two maybe if I'm drunk enough
Naked watchin three, painted ladies do the bump and grub
Mean muggin Jean - the Heebs call meshugenah
Bookin her in the Catskills like ""Look at her rap skills!""
He's rockin' a backpack, a nerd in the rat pack
Jean Martine de Begerac, you heard of her murder rap
I murder rap, you learn it, confirm it and burn its audio
Music for your convertible, music for burnin cardio!
Don't use it for burners - they'll find me in your stereo
And blame me for the murder sock me up and get me carried off
I know I said murder befo' - murder murder, FUCK IT murder
Make it fo', insert a learning curve
Mine is so high you get vertigo, assertive girl a-fern to blow
Eternally superlative, blindfolded learn to drive
At night up on a girder bridge, heard a ""NO!""
Talib dirty nervousness, yes the boys are back
Oh yes the boys in black, the boy's a {motherfuckin} rap star
Teeny rock star, minus the f'real and all the cop cars
Rocks off, lock bars with the realest (hach-too) in the spot

There to keep like a canine, and low like the bassline
Jean and Kwe' think alike like great minds
The crown is on my head, what makes you think that you can take mine?
They know they'll never win but still they racist like a hate crime
Runnin' track like Tyra in (Higher Learning)
We bleeding gasoline so we keepin' the fire burnin
We speedin like Valvoline and we speak fo' a higher purpose
You believe in magazines that deliver entire sermons
Give me some Vasoline cause your shit is dryer than deserts
You never fired a weapon in your life! So
Picturin yourself as a gangster the only way that you shootin
My intelligent design is a product of evolution
Psychotic, erotic, catch phrases just to, get at your girl
Create solutions for a digital world

Handle her like Chelsea Lately
Rockin' the fresh kicks like you felt her baby
We'll wait until you done bein whack

You need attention dog, there ain't no more, money in rap
So if you're mixin with GarageBand, videos on the Flip cam

Brainiac dum-dum, bust the scientifical
You feel it all up in your soul, we getting spiritual
You heard I'm coming back, it's so scary I put the fear in you
I murder every track, cause the rhymers like to stare at you
Real shit back, it's a miracle
Rap been laughable over the last year or two
Reflecting like a mirror through who is the real living proof
I'm back with the classical shit, I pack lyrical
Substance like bowls of kush into a vaporizer
And then I vaporize ya', my paper may surprise ya'
No need to brag on my paper 'cause I'm a naturizer
I vibrate higher, the truth break liars
I chose who is like us
The lovers, the fighters, the writers, the exciters
Cut the grass we could see the vipers
We cut the glass 'cause we the diamonds
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
This that upper echelon shit, what is this?
I be listening to real shit, real spit, like die hard feeling
Type of shit the fake niggas find hard to deal wit'
I'm on a higher plane, I'm destroying em' while I build them
My threat can't be contained, so my name on Obama kill list
Kweli the artist that you wanna be
Moving the through darkness, the light is what's in front of me
Front on me you posers exposing your insecurities
Supposedly it's wack and replaces lack of maturity
The purity you need to get in the game is gone
Ain't no conspiracy, stop looking for someone to blame it on
Gotta pay a debt, took a stale style and I made it fresh
Wait a second, got your girl wetter than tomato flesh
Waiting on me with baited breath
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
This that upper echelon shit, what is this?
Welcome to the
Walking through double fisted, I'm lifted on something vicious
Everything is moving, I'm getting me a percentage
Vintage, nothing but the sky is my ascendant
My girl is ride or die, I'm avoiding the evil temptress
Ain't no question who the best is
You don't like it stay the fuck out of my mansions
Pimping down to the socks, and so is business
The all night workout like 24-Hour Fitness
Y'all niggas is adorable, incorrigible
The praise that you get is barely audible
People is ignoring you, why?
The last place in the world that you belong is a recording booth
Order suit, niggas is gassed up
Petroleum a lab when these niggas get swept up
Custodians of culture, back to the future rap, DeLorean
I class up the joint the spit is valedictorian"

These cattle call 'rappers' is weak, my honor matter more
Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store
You mannequins are Chante and Kenny, I mean the Latter more
No ping pong and we volleying with the back and forth
Straight King Kong and the trap we blasting off, son
You want Nigerian money, see me in Qatar drunk
Waving the K, I can't fake the funk
Blessed with the belts, flying in the stealth
Jewelry on the neck, diamonds in the Cheals
You know I wrestle with pawns, getting my money, we gone
The automatic laying player, we Dons
You can't see us, the new phenoms, I like the Benz zeons
Split your wig like I got three arms
I need a fiancé, at least a Beyoncé
I know my vision beyond some other shit
I'm just as meaty as moms
I'm supposed to be on, the greenery gone
I'm still the king of the drama

You'd never settle for less than the whole if you knew the half
Rough as alligator skin getting crazy grip

Resting in Tibet, wild with the Gillette
Giraffe long goose on, my boots is [?]
Pocket full of coins, producers on set
Niggas with the coupes is on next

Singin' they got tracks for me to get down on
Singin' they hot when that shit don't even sound warm
Nigga I'm nasty, my style is sound porn
The graphic exposin' wack asses

The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway

Smoke a nigga then I pass to K

The pastor say we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack 'n' eh

Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Y'see the whiskAY had them girls feelin' friskAY
You was wit mAY (me) she said ""Who's the sissAY?""
And even if they did wanna get bizzAY
Freaky like MissAY and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you a fuck up of free lunch, dawg

It's more thatn you're under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes you've ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldn't get the clearances
For them it's just a check they don't respect you as a lyricist

You got it twisted tellin' niggas that you pack heat
You ain't gunning now you runnin' like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin' like Allen I've
Start speakin' New ?Wopian? and followin' Malachi
Oh, anything would rhyme, you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio, you'd be dead or in jail
All these thug niggas wanna rap
And all these rap niggas wanna thug
And all y'all fuckin' the game up
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head - that's a no-brainer
Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
I'ma bout to meet my quota you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got

No hesitation ain't no time for playing games
Go head and take all you can, and grab with both hands
Do it big or they won't even know your name
What are you doing with your life your time on earth is sacred
The time you spend at your plantation is it worth the paper
It's like you working for nathan the money's circulating
Can't pay your mortgage but you buying bottles perpetrating
Chill with them threatening raps
You sound lame you a snake you made the plane with your venomous acts
They call me Gentleman Sav because I back Miss Congeniality like Benjamin Bratt
Attracting chicks like femine-
While you only deal with the bitches I deal with the realest women
And still how they feel the rhythm in they mid section
When they blessed with the child bearing hips
Softest pair of lips is when they hair get flipped
I love my culture and heritage, keep me from being derelict
Invested in myself like this was Merrill Lynch
Been waiting for my second coming like I'm heaven sent
Even though I'm not your savior, I grace you with my benevolence

I'm known to interrupt the program, like late breaking news
Some say its only egg heads that I cater to
Then wait a few in order to make an omelet I gotta break a few
My plate is full I wasn't suppose to be here but I made it through
My reputation grew I left blood on the stage for you
How dare you say that my commitment is debatable
I'm married to the music you rhythm then I'm a slave to you
Commercial artist so relatable, consumer appetite is insatiable
I could do what they could do easily
But then they say Kweli be seeming fake to you
Record sales ain't making you, money is motivating you
The artist gotta lead I hope the fan base stay with you
The products shoddy if you rush it for the paper true
D'Angelo and Sade they take a decade or two
Keep that good music coming and they'll wait for you
Better get it while the getting is good, you do what you do
No hesitation ain't no time for playing games
Go head and take all you can, and grab with both hands
Do it big or they won't even know your name
While the getting is good you, do what you do

I'm Waitin' ...

Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock (Put it down for y'all)

(Talib)
I read the lines and all the between
In my mind I'm rewindin' the scene
The club ain't the place to be findin' a queen
You all in my dream girl
Though I can't sleep on you no
You was a star tonight
It like shown through
Vampires takin' a bite
I'm in the zone too
I always end up takin' the flight
Makin' a right for the fam
So tight in the jam
A fight began
Always heard bad niggas tryin' to act like a man
The DJ had the mic in his hand
Like calm down (Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock)
(Talib)
Yeah, it was like I was the audience at the concert
You had on Converse
With the Luis Vuitton purse
Tiger's eye around the wrist
With the fly and the prints
Lookin' up your arm and blendin' where the tattoo begins
I had to catch a plane but you make me wanna stay
I had to catch your name and I'm waitin' ...
(Bilal)
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock (Put it down for y'all)
So I can show you just what I got
(Bilal)
'Cause they let me chasing (?) through the same old song
So just clap your hands together till they make that sound
(Talib)
Yeah, hot fun in the summertime, Sly said it
Guys see the flesh catch a thigh fetish
Honeys smellin' too sweet it's like I'm diabetic
More stars in the sky than a seminar on Dianetics
Drop the top beat up the block
On Flatbush Ave. where they smoke a tree up
As shots reach the new tunes
Dogs who lose hollerin' at the new moon
Ours, I'm like the sun, the flower in full bloom
When I come out the house we complete like the number 9
You're gon' gimme some of yours, I'm a give you some of mine
Your off the sucka rhyme
A song will sound like one of mine
I know you love it when I shine, I'm waitin' ...
(Bilal)
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock
So I can show you just what I got
Waitin' for the DJ to, let your body rock

And bring heat like the blood of the mammal that's hot
And keep fighting like the boy with the mechanical heart
And watch time count down on the hands of the clock
Till the hour when the pinnacle start
Wow, and go fast like the bullet that ran through the dark
The hollow tip ripped a man apart, blaow
Yo these soldiers die in petroleum wars
Think they fighting for the holiest cause
It don't matter if you muslim, hebrew, or you a christian

Ain't no rule to a superstition stop me with going through with my mission

That's the dream, but I never sleep
Across the crowded room, our eyes forever meet
But without doubt and gloom, 'cause we can never be
That's why I got to go, 'cause you're my impossible love
Your the horizon I can see but never ride off into
I sound better than the cat who rappin' to you now
That's between me and you, what happened to us now?
Got you hopin' for the glorious
Waitin' for that victorious feelin' wanted by all of us
Kneelin' and praying that the lord in us will help us love ourselves
So much that the confidence attract to someone else

Performin' like an orgasm, my girl ain't even cum yet
Seen her by the side of the stage givin' me energy
Potentially, wife material connectin' mentally
I felt like heaven sent for me, you're meant for me
The doubters and the haters had to acknowledge eventually
You was a non-believer too if memory serves
And a heart that gives shit, tryin' to play your boy for the her
The harder that I run to you, the farther you become
It's like my heart was part of some movie that hadn't yet begun
This woman moves me and I'm a mountain of a man
You pull me in like the waves do the grain of sand (love, love, love...)
Yeah, I love the way you bring it to me
I wrote a song for you, I love to hear you to sing it for me
And let the melody carry me through the jealousy
And we can cruise like Tom and Phenelope

Yo, I try to get it here, get it there, everywhere
(What can I do, but what can I do)
So I spit it clear, persevere, interfere
With the status quo the baddest flow throughout the hemisphere
There ain't no pretenders here, only real men is here
If you see a chick she down to ride like she wanna veer
Better yet the Queen of Sheba, Aretha, Queen Latifah
I'm the boss like Aneisha Reefa
Boss? You ain't my boss? Baby
You don't run shit up in here
I don't know who the hell you think talkin' to
I'm gonna take that shit and bounce
I don't know who the hell you think you are
I ain't got no boss
See I call her baby like she 3 years old
When she fully grown so these dudes is pullin' on
She in the club like a stone cover, fully blown
Speaking in the girly tone even though you got a attitude
I can't stay mad at you
(We'll have our quarrels,) word (and you will upset me,
Tell me what can I do, but what can I do)
Nothin', 'cause if I said that I don't need you I was frontin' so
(What can I do, but what can I do)
Nothing, every time you said you leavin' you was bluffin'
Back in the days I had dreads like Lil Jon
And got numbers armed with nothin' but a pen and a little charm
Everything I'm saying be littered with observation
So I stand up for the dudes with limited conversation
You looking at a star, it's all in the constellation
Haha. You ain't no star
Haha you losing your mind
I don't know who told you that shit
She tried to tie me up but she can't tie me down
She ain't never cried a tear but she cryin' now
She tried to leave me, coming back 'cause she can't forget me
I gotta be strong so she can't disrespect me
(We'll have our quarrels), word

For the new tactics that they try on us
Them cops are lining them coffers
Why we get shot we lying in coffins
They want my demise 'cause when I arrive they stop for lines so often
Nigga just stop, you might as well forfeit
We like Shia LaBeouf so lawless
Still recognize real, still recognize real
Like the car I'm driving you foreign
My diamond cut so flawless
No not jewels I'm talking bout songs bitch
So if they after me like I'm Lauryn
I tell the feds that I'm moorish

Standing out cause there's nothing but whores here
Pimps rock crocodile like false tears
Bring it on through your force field
I'll be giving you nothing but the raw deal
What I say on display is the purest skill
I'll be giving y'all niggas what's more real
What's more real, what's more real?
I got chicks fighting like floor sales
You gossiping bloggers all fail
Look at the yardstick measuring your tall tales
And you on all fours you small scale

And I may say some things that you don't like to hear
I know this: that people lie, people kneel
People die, people heal, people steal, and people shed tears

Wake up, the stakes up

Everybody clap your hands now, tear the walls down
Dance like Rudy Huxtable scoring a touchdown, you know
Hands in the air, knees in, knees out
Drop a little symbol on them this time, no doubt, let's go
I write ten years deep and tenure's still deep
My bad I'm sorry I don't like when phrases repeat
I meant for the decades almost passed and spaceball was the least
And I'm struggling still hustle to eat
I must be built with Adam and Eve skin
While y'all motherfuckers where you flushed in
With your heart poking through on your arm stupid
Drop more bombs than on Saddam's house unarmed
My mouth's a weapon I shout like Armguard steppin'
Didn't need to get loud, no disrepect
But you know the Jean is threat to your checks
Niggas heart burning no prowl though sec to stop the attack
Ya neck back's gettin' hot on every drop on the track
And now I finally got some heat is good, let it be known
I'll still be here after all this shit is done said and gone
Can't keep running the same formula, I'm imploring ya
To quit fucking the game up, before it fucks all of ya up

Diamond cut lyrics so sharp the spit split the glass
Your mouth writing a check that you ask and quick to cash
Screaming how you quick to shoot don't even know the screenplay
Niggas rappin' black and white and rappers shakin' Jean Grae
Sick of niggas licking boots I pick and choose my battles when I spit the truth it's hot
Let the pride and move the cattle
Y'all don't really want no beef, that's too real you want veal
You baby sheep hanging in the air and tend to raffle me
Me? I don't like the taste this shit's gamey
Like magazines telling lies and Star Wars like Dick Chaney
It sucks though they losing they flavor like Now and Laters
When I bust them niggas run for the hills like Al Queda

Jean is synonymous to chivalry
Open doors but I step through first
Test the waters and I pee in them got no network
But now everyone's a rapper and everyone'll shoot you dead
Only led I strapped with a razor sharp pencil that could write but it could stab you rapid
It's all ass backwards, you're all mall performers, actors

Get mauled like Roy the alter boy
I'll jet through you like a Jet through flight, I'm unemployed
You still cared to touch me, I gotta keeps the rap level
You face screwed ugly

And racing you tackle you down
Take your money with your chest on the ground

They call him Kwe' for short, really talk to the children
But too many people feel him and they might, try to kill him
Try to test me I survive, like your grandma recipe
(Survive) like a Child with a Destiny
Survive like a Cuban holdin' piece of wood floatin to Miami
Like, Elian Gonzalez 'cause they back with the family
Survivin in the streets of Brooklyn, that's where you find me
Survivin like somebody mommy clutchin a palm tree in a tsunami
Who woulda thunk that would ever happen?
Rootin for Kweli 'cause he brung back clever rappin'
Sister - heads wrapped in fabric of the standard music
Chicks - with their tits, made of plastic look, dancin to it
In this arena I balance, your boy stand alone
And win it cause these rappers is more annoying than camera phones
Maybe it's me, it could be hard to move me
But these niggaz got me trippin' like a white girl in a horror movie!

Take a step back, you don't want it
Do you like the way he jumped on it?
Take a step back, you don't, you don't

Yeah... this the one right here, put it on everything
Drop it heavy then get in the wind like a weather vane
Let it rain, let it pour, metaphor so let it off
Like the 38th special edition of ""Set it Off""
Yo the trap, got you blastin your heat
It's hot ones like shotguns from the passenger seat
The mic booth, the district where they be packin the meat
'Cause they kept it raw as the jump off, I hop, back on the beat
Back on the street like an ex-con
With enough in his pocket for a tip at a restaurant
It's a cold world, dress warm
Cuttin' through the bullshit record labels and the shady deals
Ladies feel the beat when they out clubbin like baby seals
Let me chill out cause the raw image to focus on
Get back to my point, this joint is jumpin' like a circus song
Yeah, to break it down to the basic components
They don't want it so I'm runnin' out of worthy opponents, whoa
(Talib Kweli)
Even when I be sleepin' my brain it keep goin' deep inside
A street poem with rhymes that keep blowin' your mind
With a unique flow and heat showin
Grown men weepin in the open, tears leak into the ocean
Today is (Training Day), I passed the test like Ethan Hawk and
I'm droppin' signs like Craig G, or Stephen Hawkins
Y'all don't rhyme, y'all speak in quotes of MC's that sleep in coffins
Latchin on like a leech and eatin off 'em, you weak and soft and
(Talib Kweli)
Jump, jump, jump - Brooklyn jump up
Jump, jump, jump - Harlem jump up
Jump, jump, jump - yo, West coast jump up
Jump, jump, jump - everybody jump up
Jump, jump, jump - Queens jump up
Jump, jump, jump - {?} jump up
Jump, jump, jump - Midwest jump up
Jump, jump, jump - here we go (everybody like) yeah"

Yeah ... this is the best part of the trip
Hold on to something, hold on to someone
We about to take the road less travelled
You ain't gotta go home, but you can't stay here
Let's go
(Kendra Ross)
I get lonelier each time
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake till you come and make things right (yeah yeah)
I get lonelier each time you go away (c'mon)
So baby won't you stay with me tonight? (yeah)
(Talib Kweli)
Check it out
There's this lady I'm in love with (yes there is)
Living inside this woman unknown
But she's scared to let it show
I know it sound like some bug shit (yeah it do)
It's just she come with
Hang-ups and
Insecurities they gotta go
She always nervous around me
But see this lady inside
She's ready to be my baby tonight
And ever since this lady found me
This woman think I'm dangerous
And ain't ready to put her safety aside
I try to tell her that I got her back
And no matter where we at
In our lives
I'll treat her like she my girl
I asked her ""What's wrong with dat?"" (What's wrong with dat?)
She like ""It just ain't right
There's so many more women and men in the world""
I have to admit the girl got a point (true)
Maybe my ambition's made to make me want something I just can't have
So now it's time for me to blow this joint
I still know I'm in love
I just stay focused
And true to my path
Word
(Kendra Ross)
I get lonelier each time
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake till you come and make things right (yeah yeah)
I get lonelier each time you go away (uh)
So baby won't you stay with me tonight? (yeah yeah)
(Talib Kweli)
I got to get away
Ladies you ever felt growing away
By your man
Asking ""Baby, won't you stay?""
He chilling with his crew
He should be building with you
He got you feeling the blues
Cause the children to glue
He willing to do
Whatever it takes
To save 'em
From a fate he can't see when he misbehaving
Brave men don't let they ladies
Raise they children theyself
You're so busy trying to save 'em
That you you're killing yourself
With the
Stress and strife
And the fights and the advice
From the ladies of the night
Who can't run they own life
Up in your air
Nothing is fair
Why do you care?
Why do you always take it there?
The crying, the tears
You ain't prepared for the jewels
That I'm trying to share
Flying there
Dying inside
Hot in the fear
The writing is clear
On the wall
For you to read the sign
Ayo the fine is the way we design
To be fine
But still ...
(Kendra Ross)
I get lonelier each time (I get so lonely)
You go away I lose my mind
I lay awake till you come and make things right
(Mmmmmmm ... make it right, make it right, make it right)
I get lonelier each time you go away (la la la la la la la laaaa)
So baby won't you stay with me tonight?
(Talib Kweli)
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta, Gotta
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
Gotta, Gotta
Yo
You can tell when people wanna spend they life together
Despite the weather
They treat each other like a treasure
Can't fight forever
You got to give it up
I ain't got a lot of time
We got to live it up
I make my music like I make my love
People use it like they take they drugs
In the morning
When they waking up
This music got me out late but
I holla at you when I'm done
Don't stay up
Will love play with us?
It sting like paper cuts
Doused in alcohol
But if it's real
They ain't no greater rush
I got faith in us
It's only you who really know me
I be surrounded by people
And still feel lonely
(Kendra Ross)
So baby won't you stay (why won't you stay?)
Baby won't you stay? (why won't you stay?)
Baby won't you stay with me tonight? (oh)
Stay with me tonight
Stay with me tonight
Oh
C'mon"
126,Work It Out,2004,The Beautiful Struggle (2004),Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop,Talib Kweli,"The temperature got tempers flaring people sweat when the weather hot
They argue and they fret a lot then set up the plot
To whet up the block
Wheter or not the blood is red up in the gutter
Music is my bread and butter
I got a show in Brooklyn cause the ghetto love us
Pulled up in Mtulu's truck I'm suited up I'm cool as fuck
Security tripping on my baseball hat promoter knew what's up
Plus Chaps had on some denim shorts and white tee shirt and
I told the bouncer they being disrespectful 'cause like you we working
I ain't a custy or a patron and trust me no one would be paying
To come in this crusty ass club if I wasn't playing
He's like ""I'll put you the fuck out""
And when you put your word like that it's like third strike black you struck out
His man tried to rush me from behind Chaps stuck out a size nine
Seen him trip face first into the line
Cats is cowards with no spine and they power tripping too
The next level is the violence so what y'all niggaz wanna
Work it out
We should try to work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read the book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
We should try to work it out
Yo what y'all ladies wanna do
Work it out
To get fly she work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read the book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
Show the love
Lose the hate
Work it out
Work it out
Peolpe placed in situations they can't take and what they facing
Is the trials and tribulations to make them say the lords forsaken them
Their loved ones intervening but they always blaming them
For problems they don't realize what they part is in creating them
Like men who so insecure think they women cheating on them
And women who think the proof that they man love them is they beating on them
Keep sleeping on them soon they partner creeping on them
Committing crimes of passion they in caskets mother weeping on them
With her head in her hands
There's only one thing that the dead understand that it's better to be alive
Now what you gonna do stick your head in the sand
You probably the type to fall for anything and take that instead of a stand
Now that's a mouse instead of a man
I cherish my role as the head of my fam
And on the road I meet incredible fans
I rock with singers an a DJ instead of a band we at a theatre near you
So what y'all niggaz wanna do
Work it out
We should try to work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read the book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
We should try to work it out
Yo what y'all ladies wanna do
Work it out
To get fly she work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read the book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
Show the love
Lose the hate
Work it out
Work it out
Stay civilized when they try to kill my high I try to think through problems
Bring honesty to rap like Cam'ron brought the pink to Harlem
You could be on the brink to stardom and suddenly you sink to bottom
Tell the truth about the war and suddenly you linked Saddam
Hate the topic but the closet people get to patriotic
Is red bull white vodka mixed with the straight hypnotic
Paper prophets sell the revolution so they make a profit
Trust they got it fucked up with your taxes started making rockets
Take it off the top like politicians speaking proper diction
Stuffing dollars in they britches like they do a lotta stripping
Got the top position bitching about the quality of life
All that bullshit get exposed as soon as Kweli sees the mic
They cutting down the tree of life the sun rays is running out
The babies ain't eating right so the guns keep coming out
See how they play the streets an night slap the taste out your mouth
To show you what they work about
So what y'all niggaz want to do
Work it out
We should try to work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read the book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
We should try to work it out
Yo what y'all ladies wanna do
Work it out
To get fly she work it out
People lie, people cry, people die to work it out
Read the book, pray to god
Look inside to work it out
Show the love
Lose the hate
Work it out
Work it out"
