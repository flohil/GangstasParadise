0,00N9NA,2010,The Lost Scripts of K.O.D. (2010),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(Verse 1 - Tech N9ne)
Wake up in the morning with my betta half (Chaa)
On a boat lift the covers and I pet her ass (Chaa)
Never know when I gotta go 'cause my life is impossible
The way I'm living the good things never last (Chaa)
So I live for the minute just want to start to begin it
When I wake up again I'm on stage rockin'
20,000 people they yellin' feedin my ego
When it's over the groupies they wanna know what's poppin'
00N9na, known for dippin
From place to place I gotta vacate the mission
Gotta get the money but wudda ya know I wake up in a movie theater with my little ones on a big one
Hollywood movie with the Jackass cats
I close my eyes I open 'em and I'm back at rap
In the studio collabin killin' wack ass crap
But then in a blink I wake up and pack that strap
In the club 'cause some other niggas want my head
I don't know too much about 'em but they won't buy red
I ain't trippin' don't wanna let the killas in blue start me
Wake up again I'm a DJ Clue party
With Diddy and Jim Jones, Juele and Rick Ross, Cat Fay, Trey Songz and Drake this is boss
Amazing
Lifes hella crazy livin' like I'm a cuatro, triple, double agent
(Chorus - Tech N9ne)
00N9na
Where I'm bout to go I don't even know
00N9na
In a place where almost anything goes
00N9na
Many roads when I travel is what I chose
00N9na
Where I'm living I really got to many roads
(Verse 2 - Tech N9ne)
Me had a lot of women but dem need me (Chaa)
Wake up tryin' to hide it but sin sees me (Chaa)
Overseas nigga tryna begin freaky (Chaa)
Wake up at the award at MTV (Chaa) U
Then I stab it at you, wake up I'm back at Missou and I get to mackin a few
After the yak I take 'em back to the sack and I screw
Scat then back to the lab I got some rappin' to do
Then I wake up again I'm on stage at Paid Dues (Chaa)
This characteristic is made to slay crews (Chaa)
Some tryna get at me to battle but they lose (Chaa)
Then I'm wakin' up with my kids on a pain cruise (Chaa)
They callin me daddy, wake up in a strip club they callin me daddy
Man I'm goin' hella baddy
Amazing
Lifes hella crazy livin' like I'm a cuatro, triple, double agent
(Chorus - Tech N9ne)
00N9na
Where I'm bout to go I don't even know
00N9na
In a place where almost anything goes
00N9na
Many roads when I travel is what I chose
00N9na
Where I'm living I really got to many roads
(Verse 3 - Tech N9ne)
At any rate I'm all over the place
Music and being a father and I know that I made
Got me feelin' moon stricken but N9n remain calm (Chaa)
Livin' like I'm out of a scene from James Bond (Chaa)
Switching (Chaa) Changin (Chaa) Feelin' (Chaa) Strangin (Chaa) Living multiple lifes robbin and gangbangin (Chaa)
Freakin all over the world Middle West swangin (Chaa)
Always on the move ain't neva time for hangin'
Slick with my shit my grip don't fold (Chaa)
Pick the fly chicks and ditch those hoes (Chaa)
Kiss for my bitch my kids get doe (Chaa)
Rip in my scripts I hits this road (Chaa)
00N9ne nigga I love this grind (Chaa)
Doing a lot of good and mud this time
Dippin all over the planet tellin' the bitches my name is N9ne
EHR!
Tech N9ne!
(Chorus - Tech N9ne)
00N9na
Where I'm bout to go I don't even know
00N9na
In a place where almost anything goes
00N9na
Many roads when I travel is what I chose

Where I'm living I really got to many roads"
1,2 Piece,2007,Misery Loves Kompany (2007),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Watch yo mouth when you're talkin' to me, I'll knock you out
(One! Two!) Piece definitely

For my block, for my hood, for my sector
Look at what ya mouth got ya

Watch ya mouth or you might get hit in it
One piece two piece dit-dit-dit-dit-dit (down)
This is for the niggas from my section
Hope you learned the lesson
Bully niggas betta hold it (down)
(Verse 1 - Big Scoob)
Left, right, right, left, he's toothless
Not (?) but the Big homie's ruthless
With my two fists I can move this
And bout to prove that I can move it with my true spit
I'm locked and loaded I'm ready I'm heavy lyrics so steady this for the block Big homie bout
To get it mayn
It's time to get it my nigga my villains spit it my nigga
And if you feel it my nigga then throw a villain mayn
Veteran now bustin' with my strange cats
Chrisa Calli Techa Nis and my nigga Scat
Chasin' paper my nature we bout to sew up the nation
We keep it real while you fakin' now how you love that

Big homie makin' it happen now shake it shake it, girl
That pussy poppin' and clappin' now I be tossin ya cabbage
And you be watchin the savage so come and get it girl
Watch me as I
(?) Through the pain, I walk through the flames, insane
Wit lyrical scatter and spit that'll splatter ya brain
I'm tired of chatters get choppers to rattle ya frame
We (inny?) like Wendy's it's my way we robbin' the game
I'm throwin' them thangs, I swang with the pain, deranged
To vertical murders sho dumpin' on niggas with Strange
Ring the alarm, the heavy fuckin' hitters on
My patients will scorn the heavy fuckin' spitters on
I'm postin' wit Tech, I'm postin' wit g's in the back
My swagger so mean wit the mini machine on my back
For violence I fiend, I move with a team (?) crack
Go loco for rojo, I put that mozzle to ya back
And take you on a walk ya won't come back from
I take you to the other side of the black sun
(If you disrespect, you (?) regret it)
Ya fuckin' right Joe Vertigo said it fo ya mouth
Yeah,
(Verse 3 - Tech N9ne)
Don't you run up when I'm wit a bitch
Mumblin bumpin some shit
Talkin' bout rap when I'm just beginning
Chump, I don't do battles and this rap will outshadow ya spit
Nothin's compatible with this wickedness
When I'm eatin' some niggas just keep beepin'
I guess they just heat seekin' when it come off with disrespectful talk
You geeks weaken the Nina's the beast chief
And you heathens ain't street deep so keep beefin' and get yo head tore off
So dim scram fo sight of thee grim hand
The fight'll begin then
These niggas is rose pedal soft
This ten grand to rock with me
Him stand like he ought to be tin man
The gorillas'll blow his kettle off
With Big Scooby Joe Vertigo shit's groovy
With Cali, Big Nick truly
Nobody is gettin' through (?)
You get woozy
Then outta you head through you
Derouted and shit
Who beat 'em down and issued a 2 piece
You wanna battle me battle me
All that blabber and that'll be
Causin' you cavity
Givin' you agony agony chatterin'
That'll be the reason for your batterin'
Screamin' loud but you niggas ain't matterin'
(Already want to)
Then I can give it to you with singin' and rappin'
Don't think I can't be clappin' at your habitat
(If I harm you)
Then you must be weak and be frequently gettin' beaten deceit
And plus you a faggot now
Now (down) how many MC's must get this
'Fore they all know don't fuck with Chris
See I'm a boss boy
Fuck around with hog style
The dudes click with Strange and get tossed boy
When I'm (?)
(?) The whole night, fo niggas that came to fight, I'm like
Fuckin' with Cali, it might be trouble

2,A Certain Comfort,2015,Special Effects (2015),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"I find a certain comfort in searchin' through the
Darkness on my quest to find the light
And as I'm digging through the ruins, that line these city streets
A sense of hope walks with me
Still I hold onto this dream of a scar-less heart and a spite-less mind
No longer shall I try to find a name-less ghost nor provide
A shelter for my
Demons, there's so many I smell brimstone
Come in through family, I'm seein' all of the sin shown
Kin grown into enemies, then it be your friends gone
Ain't you very lonely, but a sanctuary when grim's home
Got rules but I dig it, God knows that I'm wicked
Or does it, 'cause when I tug it, it never shows that I visit
Tell the judge, y'all make me feel like it's hella love
So stand out amazed when I let loose on my Beelzebubs
My spirit needs jumper cables, never know love but I want ya label
I'm comfort-able
Nothing lately makes me feel like they worthy of trustin'
So I load my gun with the intentions of bustin'
Still I hold onto this dream of a scar-less heart and a spite-less mind
No longer shall I try to find a name-less ghost nor provide
A shelter for my
I'm, cool with the trauma now
'Cause it's abundant, ever since I laid my mama down
Some members talked me so bad, till my persona found
No mercy, go earthly, cock and make the llama sound
Cause that's the language they know, deep in anguish they grow
To people without rules, and make you doubt who's
Gonna love you forever 'cause they gave you some hateful mouth ooze
I was so effin true, but I became the person to shout to
Now that I'm lonely, I don't get no fun like Laos food
And I'm such a meanie, wanna come and see me? Reroute dudes
I'm chillin' in hell in hot water sittin' on my couch fools
So it ain't no problem walkin' through yo hell in my house shoes
I find a certain comfort in searchin' through the
Darkness on my quest to find the light
And as I'm digging through the ruins, that line these city streets
A sense of hope walks with me
Still I hold onto this dream of a scar-less heart and a spite-less mind
No longer shall I try to find a name-less ghost nor provide
A shelter for my
I'm good where I am in the dark, and darkness alone
I'm comfortable with it
Bring it, if you got it to bring"
3,A Real 1,2012,E.B.A.H. (2012),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"You should be accountable for the sins
You commit when behind the computer
I don't see why these mothafuckas don't get it, I'm livid
When a youngster trying to punk ya, like he wanna thump ya
But it's something he twitted
Tweeted, when the F.U.N. come ya done agreed it
Get a lump some you gonna need it
When I'm heated
You don't wanna go to war with a thug who succeeded
I'm not, the bigger person in person this music grind stops
When niggas first in the cursin'
You're choosin' N9ne's block
57 jerkin' your curtain Missouri crime dot
Both workin' turfs I be lurkin'!
In case ya be, in a bit of hate and you wake
And become an enemy the date should be late
With the brotha's memory, the Yates, nobody's safe, its how its finna be
You said that your gonna rape my daughters then cut their arteries?
Would a father be honored? We'd be slobbering to cut your water streams!
Nigga, so while you hidin behind yo' tweets
I be findin out yo' street
Cause all that flyin out yo' beak, nigga
I'm a real one, rhyme without no beat
Say ""Fuck N9ne!"" and I'll go weak, you just lyin' out yo' teeth nigga!
I can only take so much
Why don't you think if you threaten me then I'll bust
It'd be different if you stepped to me then get touched
I get a little bitter, we be beefin' on Twitter, I'm bigger
A REAL ONE! Ain't nobody iller
Don't make me call on my guerillas
'Cause what ya say might leak through
Watch what you say when you speak to
A REAL ONE! And ain't nobody realer
If I'm hurtin' then you can feel a nigga, who's inside out
Think about we'll be comin' at ya' mouth
If ya doubt, I'm a Real one
As real as they come, been me since day won
Good heart in my chest, good smoke in my lungs
Good head on my shoulders, stand in front of my soldiers
Never let anyone hold us, think back when a wiseman told us
That ""Life ain't about the destination, it's the journey,""
Fulfill one mission, get a new vision, this envision burning
Maintain determined, distinguish gentlemen with a regular person
Energy over my veins, got my things hangin' I'm turnin'
Run with a Strange gang and I'm certain
They get things changed in that verdict
Lifted, DIBKIS nigga hundred percent
Of it all real if he comin' at me sideways
Thinkin' that I will not kill, you trippin'
Been like that ain't, nothin' different
In a position throne like I'm sittin'
Can't get pissed with consistent dissin'
Fuck that, where they do that at, see a nigga act unchristian
I'm unstable, just ask Krizz then
When I flip, so it get to sic'n
Niggas ain't takin' food up outta my kitchen
I'm aiming at you, cowards
Don't stand in the way, get devoured
That's word to Jesse Deuce Howard
I can only take so much
Why don't you think if you threaten me then I'll bust
It'd be different if you stepped to me then get touched
I get a little bitter, we be beefin' on Twitter, I'm bigger
A REAL ONE! Ain't nobody iller
Don't make me call on my guerillas
'Cause what ya say might leak through
Watch what you say when you speak to
A REAL ONE! And ain't nobody realer
If I'm hurtin' then you can feel a nigga, who's inside out
Think about we'll be comin' at ya' mouth
If ya doubt, I'm a Real one
Extensive time on these lines
Obsessive with mine, and I rhyme
Express what I find, when I'm tryna access my mind
I'm here with Tech, Tech, Tech N9NE!
If that upsets you then fine
Too sensitive, busy cryin, nigga bout' to get left behind
Expensive wine on the table
In the atmosphere of a winner
Celebratin' that I'm drinkin' like fuck it I'm on a bender
Havin' the time of my life hope I sober up and remember
Keep it all Strange, brody, and its only gonna get bigger
Animosity, we don't need it
But the botchery in your tweet it
Really bothered me cause your seated
Hell up off of me or delete it
But its irkin' me cause you said it
Wasn't givin' a fuck when you read it
If all of you mothafuckas was accountable
For givin' the negative all of it would be debted, dead
So watch that evil shit you spread
I'm a real one so I feel some hurtin' pain then I go shed
Yeah, so don't back off when I respond
And take yo cap off when I go Nam'
So when you jackoff I'm on yo lawn, mothafucker!
I can only take so much
Why don't you think if you threaten me then I'll bust
It'd be different if you stepped to me then get touched
I get a little bitter, we be beefin' on Twitter, I'm bigger
A REAL ONE! Ain't nobody iller
Don't make me call on my guerillas
'Cause what ya say might leak through
Watch what you say when you speak to
A REAL ONE! And ain't nobody realer
If I'm hurtin' then you can feel a nigga, who's inside out
Think about we'll be comin' at ya' mouth
If ya doubt, I'm a Real one
I'm a real guy. Just cause you made me a star
Don't make me a bigger person. When you say somethin' disrespectful to me
I'm gonna react in the same way that a regular person
Would act on the street. It don't matter If you buyin' my records or whatever
I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck... I got feelings too"
4,Absolute Power,2002,Absolute Power (2002),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(In Reverse)
I've traveled many roads and seen many things
In search of fortune and fame
All my dreams die no matter how hard I try
So nothing but unhappiness remains
So now I sit with this pen in my hand
Itching to produce and perform
Waiting to rule with absolute power
I love these calm little moments before the storm
Ain't no way you bout to stop this sickness
From the deepest darkest part of Mizzery
Psycho alpha schizo get your check, she diggin' me
A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E P-O-W-E-R see me clownin'
Look at all you playa hatas frownin'
Raw, God said kill 'em all, Tech's back's to the wall
Fightin' for my life and Imma bust back till they fall
And I ain't even slangin' them thangs
I'm hollerin' ONE-EIGHT-SEVEN if you trippin' wit Strange
I'm really real wit it, like my homie AJ say deal wit it
Pushin' and pullin' fightin' for the mill ticket
In a minute Imma do it like a villain
Imma get 'em in the middle of a bomb
Put 'em on the spot
Till the funk go pop and if they never have other qualm
Tech Nizzle, when I'm dizzled this who be you
Rollin' wit Dave, Trav, Violet Brown, and 3DQ, who be you
For those not knowin' that Mizzou be true
Imma tell you like the Swedish would say it, ""Sug Min Kuk""
Absolute Power! That's the only way to roll
Absolute Power! They love us everywhere we go
Absolute Power! Tecca Nina's bout to blow
Absolute Power! Absolute Power!
Absolute Power! That's the only way to roll
Absolute Power! They love us everywhere we go
Absolute Power! Tecca Nina's bout to blow
Absolute Power! Absolute Power!
Now I do HIP... HOP... and I mix it wit the HARD... ROCK...
Desing this rhyming for climbing
Tech N9ne he's unwinding the shining is blinding
Greedy so we constantly grinding
I been in the game 16 years makin' rap tunes
Raisin' hella havoc up in the classroom
Now in '02 you can watch me clownin' in diamonds shining
Watchin DVD's on the Hoshitoshi (It's all Jesus)
Now I keep the crowds pumpin' they jumpin'
Get back to the telly we rollin' and stickin' somethin'
Racin' to the main line
Absolute Power is havin' Halle Berry and Julia Lewis at the same time
Oh!, that's how Strange niggas run
Listen to the villain wit a gun associated tongue
(We're close to the end) but not done
The Tech's just begin begun beginning to begin to have FUN
The curse is tryin' to put me in the hearse
But I will not tumble, first things first
Took a lot of shit and I can't take more
Fuck Jay Ferries and everybody down wit him and FUCK JCOR!
Thanks to Strange Music I'm comin'
And all my enemies they runnin'
Now all my hatas bummin' 'cause I was summoned
We Kansas City playas and we bout sold game
We make it so Tecca Nina is a household name
How many points you got, I got 50
Heres a question to the Censorship Committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
My villians are gritty
Big Scoob, Tech, TWill, Bakari, rest in piece Sho Nitty
Growl wit the evil ways, power what the people say
Rebel yellin' we're felons and my pockets are swellin'
This beat's from Berlin, Germany
Throwin' up Mizzizzy so ain't no other city concernin' me
I teach it and I speak very loosely
Stamina gunnin' got playa hatas runnin' profusely
Now I got the parents pissed and ready to noose me
'Cause they know that Absolute Power corrupts: ABSOLUTELY"

(Verse 1 - Tech N9ne)
After the club we
Usually go straight to chub base
That's where the 3 in the morning grub be
And even though icons is lovely
Tonight the pad is gonna be a must see
Cause hussies are coming to give up they pussys
Trust me
They comin' to muff me
Plus three
Maxzilla, Irv and Big Nick we's bout to bust V
Open until we lust free
She sucked D
Gushed me
Then roughly
Rode this dingaling like a huffy
Luck-ly
Another 36 cup D
Abruptly
Came into the room to fuck me
She said Techa Ninna touch me
Your dick is thick and husky
It must be
Like a ride at Cedar Point in Sandusky
Well whaddya know baby girl rushed me
The TNA was so silky and fluffy
Unjustly
I crushed B
And not one of these broads is ugly
Till the next morning when they crawl in they hubby snuggy
Lookin' rough as rugby
Ye, we hit the spot if we choose her then she dippin' out
To take her to my house (It's the afterparty)
We can all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off
You can take the under-route
Tell your man you at your momma house
No but really (It's the afterparty)
And we all (Get naughty)
Take our clothes off
(Verse 2 - Kutt Kalhoun)
Full of that liquor
Ready to stick all this dick up in her
Bitch out at Nina's
I never seen but I'm fixin to fuck
Already popin I'm running late
But just minutes away
Was told to grab condoms from up at walmart
And bring 'em with me
Soon as I enter my cock's attending a chicken brigade
Somebody's pussy about to get cooked rather chicken fillet
Found me a victim
We made our way through the kitchen
Escape
Into the garage
And the ?? was bout to begin
Lethargically sucking
Heartily fuckin'
With pinky to meat
So I told the slut
To hike up her butt
And let Kutt intervene
All in her guts
In between
The Benz and the buck and the scream
Nigger you're fuckin' my whole linin up
With my husband to be
Drowning too much in the V
Shut the fuck up and I ease out
Take off the condom and I sprout
On her butt with relief
Just another episode of back to naughty?
Techa Nina I can't thank you enough
For the afterparty
(Verse 3 - Devin the Dude)
When freaks come out at night
The freakiest stays out the latest
They hit the afterparty
They got somebody take care of they baby so it's cool
No rules no security gaurds
Let your hair down
Yeah now do what you want
Maine, fire up the weed
Whenever you please
Best believe
That you got the green light
The special guest is me
And we been drinkin' and smokin' all night
It's time to find a hoe to be strokin my pipe
A bitch quickly grab my dick and ask why it was so soft
I said that it would go off
She gave it a quick blow off
And she did
And me dick
Start to rise
She opened her eyes to a surprise
Her thighs was moist
It was my choice to go up in it
For a minute
Put my dick up in it
She said it was spendid
She usually charge niggas
They like to rent it
I told her put it on my bill bitch and send it"

A superstar now is your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!
All day all night (x4)
I wrote my life down from '85 to right now
And my style had a heap of people just like wow
Schizophrenic, grim, and venomous lyrics with a slight growl
I was destined to be Tech, to rip and excite crowds
So my pals think after I rip the mic down it's lights out and right to the pillow with my right eyebrow
But when I chow I stay up and write sounds
I like loud I stay 'wake and create late like a night owl
Meetin' deadlines serious is fed time
They said I'm extremely different and I headline
I wed rhymes married to this game and my breads fine
That's why I'm always rocking classic J's the red kind
With that said I'm always up in y'alls sight
Something is all wrong being spotted it's all right
Thinking that I'm the naw type is all hype
I ain't gotta problem with being Tech all day and all night
Forreal
This ain't nothin' like a 9 to 5
A superstar now is your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!
I write my flows and record 'em
I do my shows and we floored 'em
And so they go let's award with merch and ticket sales
That's why my clothes I afford 'em
That's love I know never short 'em
So why would I go and avoid 'em and curse and give it hell
They spot me at the movies sip and try to press a nooby
Gettin' through this is hectic, next to me singin' my message to me
But I never get back to Scroogy
When I'm at the Ruby Tuesday
That's a doozy follow me for autographs when I'm set to dookie
Ewwwwwwwww
That's TMI, Whether I'm on the street or fly
What they need is I to be seated high and this heat is why
Even sometimes I be down and dark they all bright
Liftin' me up being Tech Nina all day and all night
Yeah.
This ain't nothin' like a 9 to 5
A superstar now is your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!
Ey, they even find me up in Wal-Mart and give me coochy coupons sexy mama's be all heart
Even at the Mandalay Bay I'm off in the mall part
Chicks looking for me patrolling the area like Paul Blart
And it be the same when I'm with the chief, The Game
People greet me heat arranged
Sleep they need to meet the strange
Cat, 'cause he became the creature sent to eat the game
Speaking of eat the pizza came and the beast unframed of the pizza main (man?)
At the funeral taking pictures no urinals
Not only when I'm on tour you know where I'm steppin' they sure to show
And it's a blessing even if I'm stressin' I'm durable
And You're to know, to do this like tech you have to endure the grow
Yo!
This ain't nothin' like a 9 to 5
A superstar now is your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!"
7,Alone,2012,Boiling Point (2012),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Somebody should have told me
Life can treat you really coldly
A lot of love that people show me
But when they go I'm hella lonely
When the music and the show stops
Security keep my bus door locked
That way I'm not receiving no shots
MJ, our little bro dropped and that's why they keep me so blocked
I'm in the star coach now
In the back by myself, I listen to our dope sounds
But... There was no women to round up
This hound just sleeps deeply, anticipatin' the next town's luck
It's glitz and glamour when you're on stage
Happy 'cause you and your homies paid
But a lot of my love ones up and gone away
Because I put my music first, for that it's lonely days
Oh, ain't no phones ringing, ain't no one's speaking when you're alone
Feels like there's no reason for me to keep breathing if I'm gonna be alone
I can't sleep alone and I can't go eat alone
Yeah, the crowd gonna shout, but when the lights go out
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know me being me, you wouldn't think I'd be alone
Got off my tour July 7 my children
Kicked it with me up to the 24th, then they go home
Even though my home used to be their home
But due to separation and altercations with their mama's it left me so alone
And when my girl visits, she got to leave
'Cause she's independent and has a need to make her own cheese
At night before sleeping I'm on knees
Alone, please, I don't wanna have the lonelies on beat
My two family members that room with me
They zoom quickly to work and dip out of town, you would assume it'd be
Party, party every night a narly nudy show
But it's hardly party when you're starting in the studio
I can't wait for the meet and greets, making fans
That's why I be hella happy, hugging and shaking hands
When I perform I want everybody to know
I stretch the show 'cause when it's over everybody go
Oh, ain't no phone ringing, ain't no one's speaking when you're alone
Feels like there's no reason for me to keep breathing if I'm gonna be alone
I can't sleep alone and I can't go eat alone
Yeah, the crowd gonna shout, but when the lights go out
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know me being me, you wouldn't think I'd be alone
A storm cloud stalks me making what should be a sunny day
Shed tears of lonesome despair in the form of rain
I've devoted my life to rid you of your pain
For feelings of acceptance which reveal themselves feigned
Do not mind that, scream the voices in my brain
But if I stop giving, only I remain
Though I know not of misery
For I lack the company it needs to be entertained
But misery would be a nice change
This solitude drives me insane
Yeah, I think it's my fault, y'all, 'cause I'm reclusive
And I'm thinking I lost brauds like Y! Exclusive
And I know that I might fall, 'cause life is stupid
'Cause cupid shoots it and I fight off but it might produce its
Love, whatever has it I run
People, pets and even movies that have it, I shun
Thinking back when I had a family, was glad I was some
I picture myself in the future, old mad, sad 'cause I'm one
Oh, ain't no phones ringing, ain't no one's speaking when you're alone
Feels like there's no reason for me to keep breathing if I'm gonna be alone
I can't sleep alone and I can't go eat alone
Yeah, the crowd gonna shout, but when the lights go out
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know me being me, you wouldn't think I'd be alone"

From the depths of misery I stood th-there now and forever
Exodus, insanus, nocturnus
(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
Alucard when I'm on stage
Alucard in the booth when I'm losing it on days
When it's too right I be rippin the mic every day and every night a nigga won't lay
Down for no one, towns to go from down under surround the globe to flow some
Timeless lyrics I'm that spirit that keep it young but a old one
Handle my business other rappers have no stamina in this
They be livin' glits and glam and they finish
But I've been in it since the man did begin it, well be till they end this shit
But why is the N9na so intricate (intricite)
And his life is seemin so infinite (infinite)
They call him a demon when he steadily feedin the needs to be keepin' it limitless
I was back in the days when the rappin' amazed
Everybody wanna rap ?at the waves? a lot of the rappers up from the past went away
But I was there and nigga I'm still here the killa that been feared for livin' in them years and leavin' 'em in tears
Hella fast when he say the lyrical lash and with a passion he spray
Alucard in ya dreams everlastin life ain't hard as it seems
Part of the thing got me eaten rappers up if you step you gon start a machine
Losing so many lives all alone in the skies
I've been livin' so long and this music was still goin' through it seen so many die
[Chorus: Tech N9ne]x2
Alucard everlasting
Timeless bars when I'm rapping
All these stars never last
And I will still stand while everyone's passing
(Verse 2: Tech N9ne)
Been around for the rise and fall of many and standing up y'all
They was in the game heavy involved now you ain't livin' at all
A lot of these people looked dead at me
Then I knew it would the heredity
They regretted me now they wanna know the secret to my longevity
I think it's in my blood my scent begins to flood
Everybody on the planet understand it I give them a drug
And I get no rest time until it sets shines
I say it's Alucard you call it Tech N9ne
By now you know I'm more than just a rapper
I will be now and yes I will be after
I am older than fuckin' ghetto blasters
But they wonder why youngsters love me label me master
I am faster than all of you bastards
Livin' at the bottom I got up and then a brought 'em a bullet from a gun I'm a long laster
Now you ask for explanation my last word
A-L-U-C-A-R-D read it backwards
[Chorus: Tech N9ne]x2

9,Am I a Psycho,2011,All 6's and 7's (2011),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"I see you...(laughing)...shut up.
I see you looking at me
Looking at me, so I ask
Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho
You're crazy
I like you, but you're crazy, my tours paid me
So I used that dough to allure ladies to manure bathe me
Never that my minds for sure shady
Pure Hades, rev x steady couldn't endure to save me
Why do I let this stripper burn me on my arm with her cigarette
In the same spot ten times on a row when I felt that burn upon the clitoris
I'ma get her wet, sorry to get carried away, I feel stupid 'cause I ain't did her yet
Maybe she never look at a fine nigga sweat on her breasts and get vexed so 9 bit her neck
Open, I try to contain it but that bang thang soakin'
Alter ego say why you let them gang bang folk in
Strange lane hopin' I can maintain copin
But ain't nobody talkin' when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up in her walls, I'm suffering, I'm stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin' hollerin I'm a dog
Afterwords I like really hot scalding water on my balls
Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho
Mom? Dad? I'm no longer the boy you're used to seeing
I've changed a lot, plus I've grown to hate every human being
My mood swings have now turned my dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I'm doing things I don't normally do
When illusions seem to be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck, if I was sane I would of put down the mic and say fuck it I'll never rise to fame
But with the wicked records I contain, I could probably jump without your name
No lovey-dovey let's ignite the flame if you're lucky you survive the pain
Sorry that ain't very marry to say, why is this game so scary to play?
Well let me think, cause every day my balls are getting too hairy to shave
Pause a minute, I'm stressin' the game if I go to hell, then heavens to blame
I don't mean to come off crazy but you mothafuckas seem to think that I'm hella deranged
When I was seven years old, I fell on my head and I severed my brain
If you think I'm lying then ask my mama nigga she'll can tell you the same
Should I be ashamed? No, I'm living my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent out of shape my nigga let me ask you this
Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho
I stab you with this mic and rap this verse I'm rappin' to you
Matter fact I'm rapping through you, never say my motherfucking name
Unless you absolutely have to I am not no fucking jacket
With no matching shoes and you are not no fashion guru
Can't even see you niggas, y'all wish I was rappin' to you
Matter of fact act like I'm rappin' to you if that gives you passion
To use this as an excuse then just jump up out of conclusion
That I'm attackin you dudes is just like old fashion voodoo
Y'all ain't even the shit, no y'all ain't even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my toobos
So I'm slapping you foolish with wooden paddles you stupid
Baby sitting little bastards like little afternoon children
You can call me psychotic but it's more like schizophrenic
And I can speak can anyone tell me just where my medicine is
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man I swear I'm all up out of my brain like graduate students
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears, come here, give me your face, let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look if I were to peel it back with a skillet
Then I'ma feel it crack when I hit it, then I'ma spilt it back when you heal it
Damn it Bobby boy, what in the hell, what in the heaven, what in the earth
Where is your mom? What are you cursed? Where are you from?
Where was your birth? Where were you first? Why weren't you in church?
Why is there dirt, all on your shirt? Man I think that you're going berserk
Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho"

I swear the sky just bled, red
I buy, twitch my neck, bread
I'll take them to my bed, dead
I might've lost my mind, how did I get this far
I thought about how I, kill you for laughin' at my business card
Feels like I been discarded, And I really don't get this part
Everyone is high and mighty, until they get disarmed
I'm livin' in this darkness, I got a twisted heart
I got a lethal mind state, you got a vicious bark
And there is no catharsis, no remedy to cure my ill
I know my soul is tarnished, they'll never know how to serve that feel
Black blood on the white walls, do a design in the droplets
Psycho what you might call, but my mind is spotless
Do you like Phil Collins, have you ever heard this album
Even if you know how the song ends, you will never know that I'm out of
My mind I'm above the law and I caused it all this mayhem
Whatever you say when speak is, childish crawl in the playpen
Everything falls into place and, black gloves and a tight grip
Sittin' on a chest of my victim, if you breathe I'ma squeeze 'til ya lifeless
I want skin for my bed, spread
I swear the sky just bled, red
I buy, twitch my neck, bread
I'll take them to my bed, dead
I might've gone AWOL, maybe I blurred the line
Clock ready and alarm set, I know it's murder time
I gotta find my mind, even if only a piece
I'm better off behind, down here where we know no peace
And the clouds don't move when the wind blow, put a seed in the soil but it didn't grow
They say I gotta odd sense of humor, killer clown sittin' still by the window
Tough links in a crimson cape, sat there with my lipstick smudged
I got a glitch on my headpiece, somebody come and fix this bug
Gotta protect the king, follow a black shogun
Cover the neck in bling, swallow a black hole sun
Lookin' down at my shitlist, wonderin' how did it get so long
I'd rather be the one pissed off, than to ever be the one pissed on
Amen I'm an animal inside, feedin' on everything in the open
I've been caught with a loaded weapon, red-handed the barrel still smokin'
And I'm hopin', that they waitin' for me to break a leg I'll be takin' the cast off
Tryin' to wash away all my sins, in the shower with a handful of bath salts
I want skin for my bed, spread
I swear the sky just bled, red
I buy, twitch my neck, bread
I'll take them to my bed, dead
Smellin' like Hugh Parsons, to get a victim when it darkens
Then I'm hit them with a jargon, fuck her with no rubber
Then burn a bitch I'm an arson
Then have a lot of drinks 'til I'm barfin'
When I went to do the verse for the martian
He told me to put the people up on the milk carton
Keep a knife sharpened then he laughed like Cartman
I got stigmata markings, pardon when the beast get the bar end
I put the, I put the evil in my art when the angel let go of me
And took what the demon bargained
I'm gonna make a change but I'm Harkin
If you cannot tell me when the sex startin'
I got the kind of heart like spartan and I'm enemy scarfin' then I watch Johnny Carson
If you think I'm harsh then, Strangeland not the place to be parkin'
I guess this is the part when, I tell them all that I'm part hen and part sin
Winning about Noah's ark getting carp and the book is so colorful gotta listen to Darwin
Because you like a perfect margin, and that makes my dick harden
So I'm comin' over with the sparklin' (wine)
Get to itchin' when it's carvin' (time)
Ain't no matter what the gods in (line)
Ain't nobody's 'bout to stoppin' (N9ne)

Thinkin' their gonna take it for a swim, so now I got to throw the sharks in"
11,American Princess,2009,Strictly Strange (2009),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
It started in a nice suburban home with white picket fences
This was the a life of a little princess
Such a happy girl with pigtails and curls
Such a bright future when daddy gave her the world
She got a Benz on her sweet sixteen the most popular
Nominated the highschool queen and her father was being quite nice
I mean not like a father's love, more like something else it seems
I know it bothers her wishing she could wake from this dream.
I know it's haunting her nobody was there to hear her scream
What has her father done she wishes she was eighteen
So she can up and run as far away as she can be 'cause...
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
She met a guy and his name was Jack
He served 12 weeks in basic training now he's off to Iraq
She holds her breath and counts the days till he flies back
But he never will cause Jack has died in combat
Her hope it seems her broken dreams now filled the body bag
And in return for his life she gets a folded flag
With some dogtags, but man it's so sad
The fact Jack will never have a chance to be a dad
She broke down when she heard this
Knowing that money's the only purpose for Jack joining the service
And now she is nervous her kid is crying and the bills are piling in
She keeps a smile on the surface
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
American princess is now a queen
But without a king
Her weary eyes has seen a lot of things
Not always pleasant but the future brings
A former shell of herself
She is on the streets now she is doing things
Drugs and alcohol can only help to ease the pain
But it seems like nothing in this life can hide her shame
Walking in the rain, and man it's so strange
She is thinking to herself how the hell the world changed
A car pulls up along the curb side another customer
It's time to get inside
She demands to get her money before she goes farther
The man turns his face, it was her own father.
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere"

In relationships, business, family, in the end it's about they bills
And everyone of them wanna cheat and steal
Time for me to have no chill
Come and get ya meals and they really will with zeal
All is needy, y'all is greedy
I'm falling freely
This gonna be scogging me, we brawling easy
Had a lawman seize me
Get the hell on stay
What ya gonna do but if it's a fail on pay
Loved ones exude hella rude when it used to be smooth
Like the face of Janelle Monae
She's got the glee stopped
I'm in a pit of animals really making me bleed lots
Fatigue I wanna leave then my knee dropped
When I breathe not 'cause she needs guap
So extract me from this place full of hate that'll tax me
Pass the sack 'cause I'm trying to get to happy
Exactly people are feeding they call me nasty at me
Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

They don't love you no more
They discover your flow
But I'm feeling my fans trying to shudder don't slow
Leaving the clown now I'm nothing but a bozo to 'em
Give my all in my sessions
I never thought that I would fall in regression
The music business now we call it recession
We bawl and we stressing 'cause y'all is divesting
I feel it when I ought to be top of these
Where the hip hopper be and The Rock put me
At the forefront but galore won, nothing but the Pac could be hypocrisy
They forgot about the prophecy that I keep the lock and key
But they talking ""He soft"" and flee now they wanna coffin me
Y'all can be treacherous, I'm the best at this effortless
But with Tech it's been deficits
Wanna fly away like a Pegasus
I feel like the scare is near, they don't care that Tech share his tears
At this moment, at this point in time I'd rather be anywhere but here

And we bust then they will bleed trying to seize us (cha)
Bad season, (cha) I'm ready to trip for that reason
How your beefin' gon last when your ass vegan? (grr)
I ask trees when cash is fast,
And weed then gonna have cheese stashed in trash bags,
We'll have fleas then (cha)
Yes sir that's why the milli is in thee dresser
For any motha f'er wanna test for Tech will get him wetter (cha)
Step into death your ex messing with a keffer
Never let your lover get put in less than a bed with a heffer (cha)
The mags breathing (cha)
These fags freezing cause cats teased him
And they passed on that evening (grr)
I flash B's, and sag my flags revving I blast heathins

And I'm trying to find the way out the Celexa (Ah!)

My season is devil people receiving me
They party to my words but I don't think the motha fuckas is beleving me
Half the time I think my eyes are deceiving me
Fat boy, that boy o'er there, keep they hands in the air
Whoo Kid told me I can nuke it (nuke it)

Then I'm gonna put it right in they mouth
Beat the panini till one of them say ouch

If they came to Nina with tight cats

And I'mma knock it out like my name was young Mike, crack!
Told me to bang (X6)

You're a peon girl straighten my lean and Tower of Pisa

Ay yo fat girls, come 'ere are you ticklish?
I'm mad niggerish, pull out the liquor and she told me to-

The way you make that booty talk
I know your ass a liar
So when I spank it then you whine for me to pacify it
You call me daddy 'cause I beat it like my own kids
Them other niggas just some minute-men, Uncle Ben's
But I'm a Capricorn I'm packed like I'm strapped for gore
I whip the pussy like slave masters, they backs is torn
My pole reels them in, right by they black whiskers
Rough it and catch, then release 'em when I'm catfishin'
Brown, white, yellow, tan, and all the black women
Know I Kutt it bang out and this dick is what's attractin' 'em
Even when I pass it to the homies like they Badminton
Now I'm undastandin' why these hoes keep comin' back nigga

Ay ay ay turn me up yep yep loud in here
So that everyone can hear, I got bang bang of the year
Yes them voted me so sexy, Tech and crystal niggas lace me
Y'all then came about my shit, oh shit, goddamn I'm raisin' hell
Oh well, no, I do not kiss and squeal
I am Vegas secrets so my lips forever sealed
And I'm sorry, in my PJ's bitch I'm snorin'
Wakin' up like OMG, O-OMG like a alarmin'

Na-na-na-na-na, you can not fuck with
That nigga Tech N9ne, coming wit that rough shit
Them niggas know that I deserve it when they heard it
Had the nerve to say its nothing, nigga, so I got to bust this
Be Jealous, This is dedicated to all y'all hater's
Be Jealous, I see y'all watching me when I walk in the club
Be Jealous, This is dedicated to all Mitch Bader's
Be Jealous, You mother fucker's ain't showing Tech Nina no love
Fuck Muh-Fuckers, buck Muh-Fuckers
And the pain come nigga with a bang, I'ma killer, better duck Muh-Fucker
Watch you standing on? (Nada) What you claim to bone? (Nada)
What you plan to own? (Nada) That shit done came and gone
Blood sweat and tears nigga, been about fifteen years nigga
Ain't never been no fears nigga, All I hear is cheers nigga
That's why I be in the bathroom with the bitches at Maniacs
That's why them hoe's in the club with Tech given blowjobs in the back
How many niggas really worry bout scars? How many niggas wanna become a wuss?
Fuck with a nigga like Tech and a buzz Right to the head and the grave is dug
Mean Mugs, nigga's ain't never seen love
So they stream blood while I fiend bub full of green shrubs
And mushrooms, I bust rooms, open a custom
To float across the ocean with verbal motion the notion is boasting
I'm hoaking with jealous, mother fuckers embellish
But you can't say I ain't ready for fame, yonks, and relish
Be Jealous, when you see me on the TV Screen whiling
Be Jealous, when you see me in the magazine smiling
Be Jealous, when they let me in the club for free, niggas
Be Jealous, 'cause I'm bumy wit bitches around me

Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (he-he-he-he)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
And the lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit
No more stalling, I'ma start prowling on niggas, growling on niggas
And we smiling 'cause the Villain album went six thousand on niggas
In Kansas City alone, we packed the dome with Mike and Liddy alone
In the west side, Lee Jone, Milly Mal, I left you but it's a pity you're gone
Niggas ain't know mine, 'cause they know it, and I'ma do it big
That's why the Techa Nina never ever got a problem getting a gig
'Cause I rip shit they liked (chea), I flip shit you make right (chea)
When I spit shit, I get rich quick, and make hits from doctors they liked (chea)
9 millimeter guns, gonna be the one, making a million, when I come
Never gonna be the bum, where I come from, niggas better get some
Tried to be right to these niggas, tried to be nice to these niggas
So now its time for Nine Godzilla to make mice of these niggas
You envy me, 'cause your bitch play Techa Nina all day
And you see me on MTV, kicking it with king Tech, my nigga sway
Broke niggas ain't friends to me, you niggas really want me to disperse?
All right, I'll leave, but when I come back it's gonna be 20 G's a verse, nigga

And the lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit
Niggas better stop talking about me, I ain't did shit
I don't rap against niggas, stop trying to get me to rap so y'all can make grits
Agginy, don't be speaking my name, I know I fucked up
On a personal tip, but if you niggas talking about you better rap, mother fuckers better duck
And if any of you niggas over there on the inside, infiltrating me and my rouges
Them niggas don't give no fucks about how many Tech N9ne units sold
And whoever you bitch niggas is saying, I'm kicking it in Lee Joes log
Lee Joe'll tell you I'm original, and by the way Lee Joe my dog!
And that justice mother fuckers won't quit, saying The Calm Before The Storm"" ain't shit
We killed y'all when 96-97, when about when the new shit hit
And I heard niggas said I was washed up, said the Tech N9ne flow was sleep
That's probably why I got new shit in new movies like Digging In Water and It's Too Deep
Niggas be jealous, tie you up and beat you down to a bloody pulp son
Got my villains and me, mad enough to bust one
I'm the second coming, but you don't know 'cause you dumb
Before I go, I'll tell you jealous mother fuckers to suck one

Get to the pinnacle, get some with a nigga
Get done, get gunned, get sprung with a nigga
Re-evaluate your fate
If you want monogamy then skate
You gotta let everybody get a taste
And if you wanna date you're gonna wait for Mr.
Yates
I'mma put this bass this place all up in your face
Picture me painting pretty pussy with a pen and pad and picking a pair of provocative peaches to press to the pace
Let's get this straight
I am the maker of emotion on my planet you will be blessed at the gate
Complex when the mate
Is one that could have any woman breathing so you might end up with a chest full of hate
Less to debate
If women would just ride
She feeling my love vibe
I'm feeling her cup size
She willing to plug guys
I'm giver her bug eyes
From my dick in her thighs
She thinking it was lies
When her name changed from baby to Sherlock Holmes
Wouldn't you want to shit if she go through your phone
To see if there's pictures of bitches with no clothes on
Now she pissed at the photos
Looking like a ho show
Thinking every one of them are gonna get the pogo
Or prolly done had it
She highly combative
But no no
Shining the light on me
With cheater up on the go bro
When we first started out you knew we was on the low low
Now you feeling bozo
Peeping through my property like you logo
Thinking I'm sticking them and slanging more meat than fogo

And triples and doubles
Then out of your mouth the blow out
Cause you had enough of the bitches seesing who
You saw the beautiful picture at the begging
With mister Tech in your vision
Having sex in the kitchen
And press in the living room
Sex and no less or you're bitchin
With the extra conditions
Me getting left is the mission

Ain't this night
Ain't no possible way that I can paint this bright

Difficult to be with Tech Ninna game this tight

To give it
I'm giving you me
If you wanna quit it
I dig it
'Cause I get a pussy pass every minute
But then it
A fight cause you think I'm all up in it

You should be putting way up on a pedestal
You being super happy with him instead of blue
But you wanna see shit that you never seen
My dick is feeling like you taking methamphetamine
That's why when I'm calling your phone you never let it ring
Even when he's sitting next to you I bet it sting
You wanna ride it your hide is divided
By my two thumbs, I'mma murder it when I get inside it
Hit it till you get it then get the it is ignited
When you tripping you can't fly with the pilot
I can paint you a beautiful picture
But I think it's better when you got a dude with you
Sitting at home and then you got a true fixture
You fucking perform because he got it through scripture
I'm a compatible nigga
To every woman with incredible figure
Tattoo my dick on him is that a new stigma
If you say that then music I ain't gotta do with you

Wich in shows get the folks hot, what do you suppose locked the shows rock is gotta be their old and cold pops
Racism is passed down and Gate gives them mad frowns
But how they live and laugh now should be they bis and last sound from class clowns
People should be free to be together
Should be free to be whatever you can see that we can better
When we give respect is good in any language

When I see we free to be something, anything we see

And hurt each other using color as the scapegoat

Different people together like in a shuttle bus

She all in it then she told a nigga to bite her neck
I'm excited cause the gush will give my nut the right effect
But where will I hide a set of double D's
If I try to get her jugular open
I'm gonna keep with the pokin'
Have to really be strokin' her all night
I'm wet, sunk my teeth in
Bitches in heat send me over the top they get hot
Then I gotta bring the beast in
She knows not what she ask or what this night be,
This might be the day that she die 'cause she told an animal to...

Said I'd be no rapper, but I did work and became one

I think I know why my teachers would look in my eye and say that...
And why's that?

Or the sparklin diamonds on the watch my left hand has

In your department store all I wanna do is pop a damn tag
Made it honest, that's why the blacks get mad at you
Even foreigners shop and got big graditude
I make more than you, but you got the additude
Like I can't be shoppin' at Saks Fifth Avenue
I'm just tryin' to buy my baby some creed spring flower
But they don't know that the Tecca Nina cheese means power
So they look at me like none of my breed brings valor
That's why when you see us in passing we seem sour
Last time I checked, my power shockeras
I was on top of the indy charts and not a slotera
But I'm the author of darkness and I like the opera
So why when I'm at Macbeth they won't treat me more propera?

With finesse in you, it's the knowledge from way back
The prophet of the page don't eat right till it all cracks
Blackboy rappin' from the pages torn
Street scriptures more classic than the Jimmy Cracked Corn
A spawn of the movement, keep the music movement
So my purpose stays clear and my music stays groovin
I do it for the real, I don't need Jena Six
For me to know America is still on that bullshit
So people think that black are just ball players and singers
That massa complex is what fuels the street bangers
And street soldiers to stand up
No choice to get it right, so these Blackboys can finally get they man up

Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin
Y'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy...
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little whiteboys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through...
True definition of a Blackboy
(Verse 4 - Ice Cube)
I'm a Blackboy and always gettin' underestimated
But when I move next door, I know you hate it
You had my whole family investigated
And when they didn't find no crack, you said I ate it
Uh-uh, a motherfucker just elevated
Over ghetto life that was designated
You see this Blackboy, you know heaven made it
I don't want to go if I got to integrate it
You know pellot boy, be happy you made it
Just take what you got, and stop complainin
Ok, weather man will stop the rainin
On my people head, and start explainin
What your people said, believe in the bible
But you still act barbaric and psycho
My name is Ice Cube, bitch, it ain't Michael
I'll never bleach my own skin just to be like you
(Chorus - Big Krizz Kaliko)
'Cause I'm a Blackboy...
Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin
Y'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy...
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little whiteboys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through...

Call me the

You think that shit's bad?
Listen to this, muthafucka!
How do I describe my pain?
It just rains and it rains
At the same time flame-ah
I am bane, insane in my veins,
No restraints can chain or contain me,
I'm dangerous!
When I gave you my light,
It was wrong, wasn't right,
Ain't no love was in sight when I needed.
So I run with the night
In the songs that I write
If I be violent, then I won't be defeated.
Its jet black in my brain,
Cause the hatred you gave me
Has turned me to twisted.
You don't like this,
Suck my dick,
All the kids with the sickness
Been waiting for this shit!

All the brown in my eyes are disolving,
Into the whites of my eyes now the night will arise
And I'm hype cause the beast is evolving
Step into my dreams, lot of bleeding and semen and green-rotted demons
And they feed their seeds collard greens filled with feces
And cheese pieces of human cerebrum this evening (Stay away)
Cause everything I touch turns to mold (If you want me)
Everything I fuck, striaght explodes

Man it, damn it and it's no panicking.

And she went postal and loco
Sayin', ""Her not closin, Is a no-go""

About how she got more doe and just did a TV promo

Ghostface and Brother Ali, Rakim with a band, It's so tough
We couldn't wait to see Rakim rock

Bad day with my bitch
Negativity on my phone is ridiculous
No more shine up on the real Tech N9ne
They talkin' 'bout I'm the sickness
Comin' at a nigga so vicious
Get up out of my bed, I'm sick of feelin' restricted
Fans sayin' that I switched
They can tell I was hurt by lookin' at my Twit pic
Got a call from Stevie, y'all know his steezie
Said he 'bout to come to KC wanna have a little get together that's easy
Got a little Cabo Wabo, some biz and Ciroc, yo
They wanna have it at my house, is there room for Frizz and Picasso?
Hell yeah, come on down told Makzilla be done on rounds
We gotta get more liquor, spread the fun around
We 'bout to kick it with family, put the gun on down
Nigga, I ain't kicked it in eons
This 'bout to be cooler than Freon
Got another call from my homeboy in Denver, named Dion
He just pulled into KC sayin' he's double fisted, with bottles
I told him I was on liquor duty and stone nem was on models
All of my niggas ready for action
When I woke, I don't remember this crashin'
I can try and tell you in the next verse
But I don't really know what happened ...

Woke up, got sick, ain't nobody sleepin' in my shit
Looked in the mirror, that's fucked up
Because busted is my top lip
Real busted, real puffy, like a nigga punched me the fuck out
I don't smoke but my mouth taste like big ?? like my nigga Yukmouth
I think I remember two chicks, one thick, another was a toothpick
I think I was takin' shots with 'em, of Patrón, I don't do this
KC Teas, ghetto suds, talkin' to the chick with ghetto butts
She was trippin' when another beautiful widow cut
In front of me when she was talkin', I said ""Oh, fuck!""
Everybody keep sayin'
But I don't remember even seein'
But I heard if you really wanna please
Put one, two, and maybe three
Glimpses of a house full of bitches and dancin'
And some losin' their pants, romancin' each other
And eating each other, and beating me brotha's
My publicist almost stuck a bitch
'Cause she punched my nigga with her fucking fist
But he kicked her out, instead she gotta line nigga some shit have been said
Then somehow when my ???
My lip hit her big head

It's just a blur, blur, blur
The whole thing's just a blur, blur, blur

Scenario, what happened?
That nigga keep laughin', 'cause he made all the drinks potent
My lip is fucked, I'm not jokin'
Said she's made up with hips out, she 'bout 5'1″, hell pretty, but Cripped out
Said she got a little cocky, called me a demon and I flipped out
Said her body was boozed up and her earlobes had a few cuts
I told him I don't hit women, I don't do stuff
I came downstairs, all my niggas still sprawled out
The makings of Caribou Lou, now there's a loose screw
(Wreckonize)
The night was going perfectly, all seemed well
I woke up in the darkness dizzy, feelin' like hell
I don't feel like myself, oh no
I've never ever felt this way before in so long
It's just a blur

Of yo pain hearing your pitiful game,
This is political pain
Deep in the pit of yo brain let it rain
With a unforgettable aim
Nigga lookin' for a spot to bust
Cause the homie that you killed
Meant a lot to us
Buck instead of lookin' for a cock to fuck
Kill a nigga like he was rockin' a swastika

A nigga made if you step into me
You will never benefit
Nigga if I start it Imma finish it
Run up on a mother fucka
While he fuckin' a chick
Put a bullet in her head while she's suckin' the dick
Wasn't a bit of evidence baby it's irrelevant
You got it with yo nigga that's the luck of the grit
Bring pain 2 everyone in your face with the bane
You bury some its mother fuckin' shame
We carry guns
If you don't you're insane or very dumb
Teccanina's too rough, too hard, too tough
You scarred cause a nigga know
A mother fuckin' round will spit
Fuckin' around with the killa clown and shit.
If you really wanna do it nigga we can step into
Put us up against some mother fuckers

Fuck a nigga buck a nigga

Deadly ticking like a time bomb
Fuckin' with me you think you were in Vietnam
When I explode ain't nothing
Left but remains for those who are froze
For fuckin' wit a nigga insane
Mentally minded mad mother fuckin' mad man
Is out to attack
Sinkin' punks like quick sand
Droppin' and poppin'
Any punk that bucks up bring a body bag
If you wanna get fucked up
There it is you little bitch made

Of an uzi a twelve gauge
Really don't matter many suckas die
When the shot gun scatter
From block 2 block, hood 2 hood

Make it up so high, they can't reach you
They just feel the wind beneath you

People abolish he who lovin' me never a dollar tree wanted

When they know I'm blessed at heart
Try to test Tech when I poke at they chest and bark
Givin' my blood, sweat, tears and flesh in art

You got big feet and big hands
Work it like you said you can
I'm laying here thinking ""Why did I even give you a chance
Nigga making love with you for what?""
Cause in the back of my head, I'm screaming ""Bust your nuts so I can get up!""
""Ooh aah daddy
You feel so good"" is what I'm screaming
But your dick is like wet wood is what I'm meaning
Talking about putting in work tearing out my seams
Not with that little bitty ass thing
Nigga you sweating like a motherfucker
And I don't feel shit
Why did I even let you hit?
Pass me my vibrator so I can finish this
""Is he good to you mami?"" and I'm saying ""Yes""
But truth is my pussy is stressed
She was horny ready to go, cum ready to flow
But your dick ain't even big enough to blow you know?
Walking around Killa City thinking you the man
Nigga I could've done a better job with my hand
So the next time you on your way to my place
You won't need a condom
Your tongue is bigger than your dick daddy
I'ma ride your face
I love you Tech N9ne
You inspire me"

Another piece that I wrote, about me
Being stuck in my ways, yeah
(Krizz Kaliko)
And I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am
What it I do to be so wrong?
Could it be so different?
Is there a remedy?
Will you be forgivin me?
Cause this ain't, my life, or the way it was sposed to be
I'm waiting here for you to come and tell me
What I do so wrong?
(Tech N9ne)
Listen to me, this talent was given to me
By his omnipotence so dig it music is livin' through me
Even through prisons I've arissen he big and is in movies
Ism if is is a hit, the vision is in beauty for women
When I'm writin I'm winnin', so excitin I'm grinnin
Then you strike an now the fights are beginnin
I gotta be sharp as a knife when I'm on the mic an you sinnin
By stiflin my spinnin what imaginary life has you been in
By thinkin' you be the reason, no speakin' to you this evenin
I'm deep in this music reachin' for the piece I dilute the season
But you be illin cause my attention you truly stealin
Pursue the millions, come in second-would you be willin'?
Don't think so, you be thinkin' time an I think dough
Love is what you need from me but in time it'll shrink mo
'Cause I be on the grind for this rhyme an the ink flow
I go for mine an you think it's a crime an I think ""Whoa""

(Tech N9ne)
Everything in my closet is black, white an red
Most of my homies was bosses but got life or dead
Now I move in they shadows but I got the mic an bread
But this life it seem ya destiny is a knife or lead
Yes I was brought up in a Cristian house
But my mother marreing a Muslim threw the christian out
An what they did to Malcolm X threw the islam out
So my homies with money seemed to be the glistnen route
What I found was funerals and I found it was real friends
But I paid attention and then I found that it was real men
Takin' care of their familys automatically built in
Riskin they life in the street as long as the wheel spin
SO, what I gathered from it is simply my perogotive
I only wish the organization was more positive
I maintain, and continue to gain thangs
I bust an I claim Strange but I'm reppin that gang bang

An I can't give up what I'm in love with
But I guess I'm a mess an I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am
An I can't give up what I'm in love with
But I guess I'm a mess an I just can't shake it

Killin' evil with an icepick

51,Cloudy-Eyed Stroll (Remix),1999,The Calm Before the Storm (1999),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Sunday morning I awake with head aching from the night before
Me and my niggas at the bowling alley tripping 'cause we all tore
I reminisce and kinda laugh despite my pain
'Cause they kicked us out for throwing balls in other peoples lane
Sunny day in the summer
Is about to become a cloudy one outey from perious puffs
Devious sluts, mysterious stuff
Picked up the phone its on
I got my niggas on the line ready to swoop the N9ne
Once again I'm trippin' on my relish to spend
But today I'm not gonna take these bitches to the West Glenn
'Cause me and my Road Doggs and Road Hoggs
Slippin on a mission and conteplating on old calls
30 minutes later I'm waiting at the door ready to go
Feeling relieved when I heard my niggas roll
Yelling that's my ride as my babygirl cries
Stepped inside looked around and everybodies looking
Cloudy Eyed 8x's
Come and take a ride wit me, fly wit me,
Get high wit me, come and get cloudy eyes wit me
Everybodies blown but me Timly got them straight cummolous in his eyes
Puffing because Dr. Bombay and Purple Fuzz up above
This Sunday sunny day had that ???????
Scoop just started because his eyes restratus
435 North we dipping the suburbans filled with smoke
We jerking I'm hoping to get the new rotation working no joking
Eyes open
For the feels what it is what it was what it shall be
Is we high on L.A. indeed
Pass the puffy on the mid west town side much obliged
'Cause I'm feeling high up and cloudy eyed
Windows down windows round my crown astounded
Right now my ?marial? don't wanna be grounded
I clowned it
Now my name is Munchie
Ooh you high
7-11 got the best food in the country
Blunts be serious when stuffed with funk
From the depths of Mizzou niggas have no clue what to do
Caught up with black in Texas Will
What's the deal on our way to New Peking for real
We loud and boistrous as we stepped inside
Peoples looking at us funny 'cause everybodies looking
Cloudy eyed stroll now my strides slow
Walking up out the New Peking eyes closed
Took another hit from the poison mist
Got my brain on twist but I still persist
What's up?
What we doing on a Sunday eve
Its straight to 5-6 best believe
We calling up some biancas on the humbug
To come down around the town everybody else is Skateland bound
5-6-1-6 Highland feeling far out like Thailand
My man Diamond said no one can roll 'em like I can
Damn once again its on the biatreces from the phones
In the house and they straight getting blown
What ever happened I don't know
Woke up on the flo
5 o'clock in the morning I'm read to go fa sho
Gotta get back to the crib my squeeze said this shit is getting old
They dropped me off and that's the end of my (cloudy eyed) stroll"

I can't believe you did this to me after all I did for you
Cause you made me so mad and there's nothing you can do
You and I were clueless, but you were the most
And I guess you just got lost
Baby you were just clueless
So clueless
What did I do to deserve this kind of pain?
Out of all the fights, this was the main
You said to give it a chance
But I saw you at the dance
We tried to work it out
But I still had a doubt
(Clueless)
I just can't take the risk of getting hurt again
And you're way worse than other men
I used to think you had a brain
But now I know that you're way insane
You tried to steal my heart away
And you'll pay for that someday
(Clueless)
I can't believe you did this to me after all I did for you
Cause you made me so mad and there's nothing you can do
You and I were clueless, but you were the most
And I guess you just got lost
Baby you were just clueless
(So clueless)
I can't believe I let you play me for a fool
N' wt you did was so totally uncool
I had no clue it would end this way
And I don't really care of what you have to say
I'll never forgive you for what you did
Gosh, I was such a kid
(So clueless)
But now that I'm grown and mature
I realize that I was blind and unsure
It ain't gonna happen no more tho {no mo}
And it's obviously the end of us, yo
Now I just wanna scream and shout
Cause you don't even know what our relationship was about
(So Clueless)
Should've told me the truth in the first place
Now I'm gonna have to pick up the pace
Boo if you loved me so
Then you wouldn't be this low
But now that I figured out your cheating ways
It's just too damn late
(For us to ever be togetha again!)
And you won't get away with anything else these days
(This I promise you... Yeah...)
I can't believe you did this to me after all I did for you
Cause you made me so mad and there's nothing you can do
You and I were clueless, but you were the most
And I guess you just got lost
Baby you were just clueless
Clueless...
Clueless!
(You should've told me before... should've trusted our love
Should've thought about that before you went on and broke my heart...
But its ok because in the end I'm better off without you
And its just too bad that I can't say the same about you! you're so clueless)"

Now I wanna go to my second home big Tech is prone to conjure
Some of that new legal purple good Colorado-marijuana
Break it down, curl it up, fire it up, pass it 'round
Got that dope, eighth and a dream and cuddle with a purp when I'm in a town
Nobody fucks with regular, on my shit spectacular
Hit it for the low shit gotta be real loud, and this wild next to ya
Rhino rolling in the most, hydro mixed with indigo
Blaze that shit, really can't get no high, but niggas still feel me though
Shoakin' dough, blazin' fire, roll 'em up, mile high
Lovin' Colorado strawberry kush open wide
Put you lighters up in the sky when the nigga do it
For the homeboy Pakelika, Restin' in Reffa!
Smoking that good Keisha
Through a vaporizor with a feature
Tech N9ne, I'mma kick it every time
When I ease my mind, I hit my bottle
But they legalized it in my second home
When I go I'mma hit that good Colora-do

Rollin' up another thumper, then we on the way to kill another gig
Info, Frizz, Stevie, Tech, Ubi and Picasso too
Joggin', I'll get it open, talkin' smoke so loud that I can't hear you
Look at me walkin' sideways, wavy but I'm not sloppy
And I'm burnin' down the bush, with the chief the spirits have got me
Better roll up you know I'm cold as fuck, going nuts iffin' I'm up in your place
Takin' a hit of the purp I'mma hold it in and blow it in your face!
Info Gates bitch don't hate
I showed up at the studio bars official
'Cause I'm on trees like carved initials
I got that Candy Maldonado but I've been KC, not Colorado
So if a cop finds this avocado
I got in this medicine bottle I gotta get
Be hittin' the indica strain when it get in my brain
That it isn't the same, I'm twistin the flame
Light up, the Ces is definitely beneficial for the pain
That medical Jane never synthetic you know photosynthesis gettin' the blame
Blowin' legit if you switchin' the state, uh, blow the piff and I'm driftin' away
When I'm out in the Springs with a mountain to king
I'm countin' the ounces they bring, they offer that kush (Kush)
They burnin' the bush, they 'bout it no doubt it's a thing
I'm jackin' the cyph, then I'm coming for Colorado for over half of my life
I came from about it back in the day, got a habit for packin' the sack in the pipe
I blowin' that it in
Toke, toke, toke, toke, you know it's that fire, I can't get no higher!

Been an outlaw for minute though, smokin' out with no shame
Blowin' loud out of my sun roof back in the Sunshine State
But then boys offered that cake so it's a cat and mouse type chase
So I growin' eyes on my back and droppin' brains over my face
I need a high estate, elevate, gotta get back up to that Denver stage
Where the fans are Strange and the air is thin
But I smoke is thick I just can't explain
Sparkin', puffin', passin', ease your pain and all these forms of fashion
I think it's only right to celebrate it, just get
Up-up high, get 'em up-up high
Stuck in the sky, we gotta lust let's fly
And I just met my angel dangled
With a halo and a bud supply
Went over limits and you heard the tale
About my freaked out tweaked out weed dungeon
But I forget about that when I'm in the do
See I be all up on them Green Funyuns
Took another trip out to the CO
Where they be telling me the liberty is legal
So that's no piss test for your PO
We go to free load and debo Doritos
Showing love to Metropolis
And the brother with the funk on the side of the curb
Green cross in a seson of moss
When they all breed crops and they dying to serve
Fort Collins to Boulder we smoke the air
We just feel wicked we on that Jodi Arias
Rollin' and jokin' these folks just stare at us
Trippin' for no reason when it's so hilarious
You high or something, you stared but you scared to puff
You wanna fly with me yeah have fans with lust
Just be careful when you hit it, I got admit it
I been known for sprinkle these orange hairs with dust
Forgot where we was, tried to order a quarter pounder
From a Taco Bell drive through high so we drove off
On the road lost blinded from the smoke fog
Made it to the crib I hit the door and then I dozed off
Broke off my homies a couple buds
And ever since the day I did it I got a bunch of phone calls
Ask me how much do an O' cost
In Atlanta got 'em smokin' on that dope dog yup-ya-uh-yeah
When I'm in another land I smoke that fire-iah-iah
I don't really hit to choke but tonight I'm gonna try-iah-iah
Take some weed, mixin' with tobacco leafs
Actually and breathe and I lose my faculties, naturally
(Okay) Worldwide now, following Tech Nina
Take another hit if you got that reefer
Bring me a little bit of that sativa
Baby tokes is my anxiety
Don't like when I put up inside of me
I go back to the bottle, when I take a hit of that Colora-do"

Lord knows, all the different situation trials and tribulation,
Aggravations that a nigga's facing
I get complacent, that's my ass I'm a memory
They spillin' liquor on the curb when they mention me
But ain't no fear in me, get it how you live
That's if you hearin' me, then dug down and dig.
Lace yo boots, man prepare for this struggle
Stay in them trenches hella dirty, grit and hussle.
Chrous
Ain't nobody ever gave me nothing
I'm on my own, I was down and dirty when I was young
But now I'm grown and I continue to struggle you heard me
Me and my niggas in the coarse and we constantly dirty
(Repeat 2x)
Nigga, I gotta pocket full g's I'm constantly
Serving my Nina knock'em to they knees I'm constantly dirty
Supervillian check my powers I get the early worm
Chop with hoppers loose the kopper's with just a single turn
True to life through the mic they got me telling stories
With the fame and the lights I feed my territory
Gutter living with precision them busters know they phoney
Flipp my profit keep on rockin' it for my dead homies
They wanna follow my shadow and waddle in mudd
It's the infallible cannibal with the dirty gloves
Absolute with this power they call me realistic
Savage with cabbage still coming up off that Vill living
Giving my life to the night on the dirty
All my might when it's right then we strike on'em early
Twisted life living dirty, super savage I'm out to get that bread
Gutter living that's my habit until they rest my head
(Repeat 2x)
Which one of y'all can I holla at when it's time for me to pay rent
And who you think gone lone me money once my last is spent
I got a even shorter list of people to call on when I'm in a pinch
So I might just walk around with my jaws clinched like the Grench
I'm headed for trouble 'cause I can't sit here and struggle
How can I bubble if I don't get out and hustle?
I'm in the wind put the spud on the muzzle
Put on my hood and grab my gloves and my shovel
Tie up my boots because the mud gets thick
Then hit a lick so quick they think I love this shit
Real life gutter living nigga coming straight from the brain
Some handle the stress others break from the pain
It's been fifteen of the damdest and ain't nothing changed but the weather
Times are still getting harder and niggas can't stick together
All through my teens, twenty's seven when I'm thirty
Txx Will a be gritty, grimey, constantly dirty
(Repeat 2x)
Ain't nobody gave me nothin' but God
He gave me talent these civilians
Perpetrating a fraud, that point is valid
Got niggas sayin' they made me
The only thing that was maybe was music
Cause nobody ever properly paid me
Don't get it twisted that little money was appreciated
It got me out there again glad that's alleviated
But the nigga that say I didn't have a following before Mitchell Bade
Hit the streets must be inebriated
Soon as Mitch hit it hit because we some talented
Mutha fuckers but they still talk shit
Keep that shit low black, that shit be getting' back
2 a nigga that will fight 4 you at the drop of a hat
I tried to tell'em let me do this here
They talkin' like they don't want Nina getting' through this year
I'm still strugglin' hard, how can niggas disregard I'm 30
Watch what you say when you speak to little birdies
I'm constantly dirty

57,Creepin',2009,Sickology 101 (2009),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(INTRO: (spoken))
Areola, that shirt came off, that bra came off and... so crazy
What a day. What a motha fuckin' day. I tell ya.
Baby, I'm home! Hey, baby!
What's that smell? Smell like... like my baby's pussy.
What the fuck?! (Oh, shit! Sorry! Shit!)
What do you do when you're workin, come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' ""Whatcha doin' that for?""
This is how it goes when you're hard at work (hard at work)
I'm with ya lady and I'm all up in her skirt (all up in her skirt)
She chose a rapper 'cause this rapper know how to tap her
Strap her down and attack her while you sneak in, watch pornos and jerk (watch pornos and jerk)
And ya can't be mad at me 'cause your thick bitch wanna ravage me
Got my big dick in her cavities then it's spit spit I'm in anatomy
And ya can't come badgin' me 'cause she sick wanna insert half of me
Straight addicted to the master he whips the sticks up without batteries
Poetry in motion
I make her water 'cause I'm a scholar I father her twat and bother her I got her
She'll eat anything I want her to eat, she'll swallow anything I want her to swaller
She'll go down and chew on my dog, doin' anything that'll make me holler.
And you the victim don't even know what's ya comin' home to, I'm bangin' it out and she's screamin like we doin' kungfu.
I'm feelin' right 'cause you the one she do the wrong to.
Now that you know your lady is creepin' - whatcha goin' do??
What do you do when you're workin, come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' ""Whatcha doin' that for?""
But it ain't no need though, 'cause I'm a G tho... I find em, then fuck em, feed 'em & I let him repo.
I understand you're punchin that clock, but while you're punchin man, I'm punchin that twat - gonna get that overtime
BG Bullet does step over the line, gotta key to the crib, this pussy's suppose to be da line,
This bitch too old to be lying, she done told her husband things suppose to be fine,
You da bigger man, and I'm her clover leaf now, what about the clothes that he found:
Did you tell him you love him, did you tell him you wit it,
Did you tell him you this love his dick every time that you get it - I don't think so,
So Ima keep things low, keep pullin these strings close that pop that El Nino - (yes!)
'Cause I'm the best at it, your lady's sex addict - all in the spot when ur not, getting my head patted.
But Ima keep this thing respectable homie, I'm using condoms in your festival homie, no need to killa nigga!
What do you do when you're workin, come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' ""Whatcha doin' that for?""
What would you do if your boo crept on you-with me, new tattoo with the letter ""P"" - all over her humps like the letter ""B"".
Trip if you want to, scared nigger - never me: your girl has been land-marked,
That means that I marked her - that means that I skidded sperm all over her twat fur:
That means that I got her, where you never had her- sex game critical, now she is a master.
You never got ur dick licked, mine is getting tongue-kissed, she could suck a orange through a straw - call her Sunkist:
Man, she a cold chick, yeah I know you miss that: bank account access- ya- you know I did that.
Put it where her ribs at, then I let her slip on it -if ya like it then ya shoulda put a ring on it.
'Cause Paul Mussan had that pussy with a sling on it. And I ain't even poppin' E homie, but the question is:
What do you do when you're workin, come home, and I'm creepin' out the back door
Pants on the floor and you're lookin' at her sayin' ""Whatcha doin' that for?"""
58,Crybaby,2008,Killer (2008),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"I was born in 71' in Kansas City, MO
My momma was a heavenly one, so the fam was pretty slow
When it came to rap and R&B and plenty more
Check it, if it wasn't on gospel or apostle
Or written in the Bible, then it go
So when they tell the baby don't do something then I end up doing it anyway
Like, don't listen to rap, it's the evil music of today
But, I really fell in love with the sound that was coming out form the East Coast
So we got it and twisted it up a bit, now the industry's having a heatstroke
Some say that rap is dead, but when I get the white, black, and red
And jump on the tour bus through 58 shows, then I'm back with a big black sack of bread
Can't believe that that was said, 'cause I'm here with a stack of fed
And I got it from rap/hip-hop or whatever and I did not have to beg
So, here I stand, the mic in hand with my rap attire
And I like my fans spending grands 'cause we got the fire
Our merchandise, like 5 G's every half an hour
And you cry like a baby so your mic must be your pacifier
When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Crybaby)
When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Whatcha crying bout?)
(x2)
If it's negative, I don't wanna hear it
Eliminating player haters with their evil spirits
I hear 'em talkin', they mad at Smurf and Souljah Boy
They hating big in the magazine, and don't even know the boys
I know the ploy, washed up rappers wanna attack people
Run up to the car, pull out the mac lethal
Man that's a problem with the black people now
What ya need to know is that, in the world there's a lot of dough to stack
And the ones that wanna hold us back ain't been outside they cul-de-sac
Every nigga I know is strapped, rip shows that'll blow ya back
But notice that, I can put it right down to where the shoulders at
Hating on the south? Why? Trippin' off them chips they got
You don't like that it's screwed and chopped
But you wanna get off in they pot
Wanna be MC you talk a lot, up in the spot and you hot
'Cause they 84's be poking out
What the hell is you cryin bout?
Everybody wanna be killa but not for reala
'Bout the method of making money you gotta get the milla
By doin' it like I do it do the work and believe in it
When you do it to the fullest ain't no problem achieving it
When I was broke, homie I went for mills
Got on the mic with the intent to kill
Stronger than ever, and you a gimp for real
I drink caribou lou, and you drink enfamil CHUMP
When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Crybaby)
When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Whatcha crying bout?)
(x2)
You should be clapping when folk make it up outta the ghetto
Or trailer park, it don't matter even if he black or if he guero
But, you don't know how to be male
Instead of a Timberland, you probably in a stilletto
Better yet in a baby shoe, jealous of maybe you
Sick of me 'cause I'm making dinero
And you don't wanna get clapped at
You want a standing ovation? I thought not!
You say you better than rappers on radio, man that's false chop
Try to run up on me, cause a benzo will never be in your car slot
Try to step up on the scene, my infra-red beam's right at your soft spot
If you was on TV and balling you wouldn't grown and trip
He'd keep hatred, envy, and bloodshed on his lip
Tech got long cream with chrome things on his whip
(????) With a chrome thing on his hip
But just know your hip will not stop the hop
'Cause when you look at the big picture, my block pops alot daily
So keep on thinking my clock stops the shots
And I can quickly bury you in your Osh Kosh B'Gosh, baby
When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Crybaby)
When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Whatcha crying bout?)

Now with your loyal fan base and to the extent
That there dedicated to your music and your message
It has some people calling you a cult leader, how do you feel about that?
(Tech N9ne)
Cult Leader... eh hahaha
(Man)
Yeah there comparing you, to you know like Jim Jones or David Koresh
(Tech N9ne)
You know that's real fucked up to um compare me to Jim Jones or uh David Koresh.
You know what I mean because those where not people that where for the greater good
You know what I'm sayin', there tryin' to say, that I'm gonna feed my fans electric kool aid
They got me fucked up...
In this house there is no room for envy, this is why we wear our uniform!
Racist not welcome! Rapist not welcome! Hatred, dreaded in this house!
Ready to fight hatred with love? Join us!
If you come with me then I can show youuuuu
Where we'll take you where you dare not go tooooo
Follow me and let my mind control youuuuu
We'll rebuild this world that will destroy youuuuu
(Tech N9ne - Verse 1)
How many wanna go? How many wanna know?
How to fight demons when the planets gonna blow
Alot of ammunition gotta be packin alot of doe
Being together it is wonderful the gun was loaded one exploded
Speaking to me with the tongue he just folded
From the Tech soldier some you get blessed over
Bums they straight come from under ???
I told you, That I would die for my loved ones
Kill for my blood ones beside a cousin
Together when the evil does come
I question are you willing to plug one
Protection is one thing you need
To battle any animal coming with greed
If evil try to penetrate us and feed
Simple mathematics demon you bleed
I know this comes off violent but this fights for love
It should not be this way but evil drew first blood
Put the roman numeral 9 on your inside right wrist
So I can read and pop it like this
That's how we know we together in a crisis
And you don't need alot of your money to buy this
Stay with me in the darkness when the light hits
I will promise your family low prices
A better war for your boys and girls might get a little
Dark and gritty before we get to the brightness
If you come with me then I can show youuuuu
Where we'll take you where you dare not go tooooo
Follow me and let my mind control youuuuu
We'll rebuild this world that will destroy youuuuu
(Tech N9ne - Verse 2)
The red is for the blood we all shed fighting
The black is for the nights we fight with no lighting
The white is for the clouds from which we came flying
Landing in this jam with man and then began dying
We slegna see dread through these retinas
We beg to be swept up by the blessed head inspector
But all these heckless don't respect the way we lecture ya
Get next to ya, that's when the Tech get flexed (?) with us
If I happen to die at the end of my run
Please give all of my notebooks and guns to my son
When the smoke clears I hope there's some folks near
To vote me as the pope here, not quote fear is not a condition the no tears
The new color is black clothes black boots and strings
I'm gonna show these non believers what mass lab producing means
If you come with me then I can show youuuuu
Where we'll take you where you dare not go tooooo
Follow me and let my mind control youuuuu
We'll rebuild this world that will destroy youuuuu
(Tech N9ne - Outro)
That's right, there are people right outside these doors that actually would attempt to be our opposition simply, because of the love we have for each other, the love.
Ain't that something?
We still have our daily jobs we still pay our taxes, right. Some of you all ain't paid your taxes but we workin' on it right?
So what do you think the problem is? That we all dress alike? That's petty that couldn't be it. That we help those in any kind of trouble, that's suppose to be a good samaritan, Right?
They evil that's why we have friction, and what do we do to evil? OWHH, (OWHH).
Off with his head
(Off with his head)
Off with his head
(Off with his head)
Off with his head. That's what I think."

I was born in seventy-one
In seventy-two I started to walk
Seventy-three
Seventy-four
Seventy-five
I learned to talk
Seventy-six I tried sexing
That was around the age of five
Seventy-seven
Seventy-eight
And seventy-nine
I started to ride
With my
Uncle Ike
In eighty and eighty-one
I was about ten
But the first time a little chick
Made me cum
Was eighty-two
Or eighty-three
My life really came alive
In eighty-four
I was thirteen
But
Nineteen eighty-five's
The number
I met this bitch
Who told me if I got tight with her
Together we would grow rich
Type of chick
That'll make a brother
Feel good inside
In my mind when I'm sleep
Woke
When I walk
When I ride
Getting to me in the classroom
Used to follow me into the bathroom
And I loved it
She was wild
And everyday
People bore me
Captivate
Activate my hormones
When you speak to me
Softly
Offer me
A piece of you
Cause
Me so horny
She let me foreplay
And that's it
She said
If I would rap
And make some dollars for us
Maybe I can get a hit
I was writing
Then I found myself fighting
For the juices
When I found out
That our little agreement's
Non-exclusive
Ah damn
She let celebrity status hit
So I'm thinking of tactics
How to leave ran down
Prophylatics
On the mattress
So I practice
Hoping to stuff my fat dick
In this rap bitch
Knowing when I stuff my cactus
In that catfish
Imma flat shit
She's turning me into a killer
Devour fools
I'm powerful
Like Mecha-Godzilla
She said
If I keep rapping
She'll keep clapping
But ain't nobody strapping
Till she see paper
And then we'll see what's happening
And I hear her say
You heard of Tech
He's like the best
He built his nest
In the Midwest
The boy can flow
And he be busting like
Boom boom
It's like I'm stuck
I feel I'm cursed
About to load the N9na

I'm finna be busting like

To a party in L.A.

She introduced me to

She took me to this party
In Beverly Hills
Where me and Chris Tucker
Couldn't get in
Because of our ball caps
And they was all about dollar bills
She was a G
And got us all in for free
Ran into Pac again
She talked about him so tough
I knew she was cocking him
But I never did hate
Because I knew
Heated sex
Was our fate
As I got clever
And a lot better
She started letting me and my boys
Hit together
Me and Pac hit the slot
Now it's out in the open
Didn't take long
To make her get it on
Came on strong
And Thugs Get Lonely too
Was our slogan
She wanted me
And Chino XL
But he backed off
And said that's hell
He don't dip into every female
Waiting to exhale

I am not the cryin bitch,
I get up out to try and grit,
Put my vocal tape I sell it then ima get to buyin shit,
Made it up out the lions pit,
No fuckin' denyin' this is some high and mighty spit
I'm rhymin in the year the Mayans writ,
Destruction, introductions to new front men,
Working for the government,
Snups and lust they trust in,
I was in the gulf when U.S. had a post reduction,
But for the soldiers stuffed in dust we gotta turn up the cups then,
And party with they families,
We kickin it to anarchy we granted these insanities the kid would get humanity,
Vanishing is who standing in vanity,
Damn it B L double-O D you scammed that T you die under canopy,
I don't trip off with another nigga do
And I don't lip off to another niggas crew
If I ain't got a trigger to
I'm tryin' to live a few, they say do your thing
You different kinda nigga you.
Close to my rage,
And far from a jiggaboo,
Do your thing,
You different kinda nigga you,
Over came the shit that they be giving you,
Do your thing you different kinda nigga you,
Close to my rage,
And far from a jiggaboo,
Do your thing,
You different kinda nigga you,
Over came the shit that they be giving you,
Do your thing you different kinda nigga you.
(Krizz Kaliko)
I'm a different,
B R E E D,
And I live it,
See the people lovin' on me,
And I give it,
My hardware including the arteries
I don't be horrible like me if you ain't water soluble,
I use it,
How you gonna change the game if you ain't got game changin music,
And I lose it whenever niggas ain't the same and they plain Jane and April fools it,
I beastly slipped and like my sides is greasy till the industry on the eyes it ain't so easy,
Lookin' at me like a leopard,
Now they lovin' the keffer,
Lookin' like I'll never make it,
Lookin' like it own pepper,
While my musics so Sebastian Bach,
When the world ain't thinking like I'm thinking better dummy it up but the cash is stopped,
I gotta smash it a Asher Roth that'll shake the spot,
And so he has so much time in his song and that gots to say alot,
Tryin' to get paper fore the paper stop I'll make a plot to make my bank account look like Vegas minus the bacon twat,
It's effortless for me to pepper it with cleverness but they just gimme
A glimpse of the pimps who they be steppin in,
Got 'em guessing what I'm gonna (do)
Never change my lyrics (to)
Be jeffin with you jigga,
Different kinda nigga you.
Close to my rage,
And far from a jiggaboo,
Do your thing,
You different kinda nigga you,
Over came the shit that they be giving you,
Do your thing you different kinda nigga you,
Over came the shit that they be giving you,
Do your thing you different kinda nigga YOU!"

I'm an angel-slash-demon, man, you know what I'm sayin'?
What makes me a demon is lust, I'm girl crazy
And that's why I couldn't keep my wife, you know what I'm sayin'?
And that's the lust demons living within me
And uh, but my heart, love big, you know what I'm sayin'?
So I know a lot of demons come to my shows, as well as angels
You know what I'm sayin'? A lot of demons, a lot of demons, a lot of demons...
When I was one, and a two, and a three, and a four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plum rotten to the core
It was nothing but an itty-bitty demon
There's a demon inside of me! Can I kill it? Hell naw!
Can I kill it? Hell naw! Can I kill it? Hell naw!
There's a demon inside a me! Can I kill it? Hell naw!
Can I kill it? Hell naw! Can I kill it? Hell naw!

Yo, it make me wanna drink a lot, go up in the pink wit not
This the reason I ain't at ease and currently on the brink of pot
This the reason I sit at the window with the millie
Wishing a nigga gon' come break in
It is the reason I be freaking the women deeper
Loving making her silly because I done they friend
It is the reason I bang, it is definitely the reason I slang
Distributed the 'caine
The reason I'm super soaking in the pain, and starting to love it
It's wanting to give me way more of it, they want me to lug it through the mud
And thus the reason with happy people I'm disgusted
I'm talking about those things that make you do bad things
Living the evil up in the fast lane
Making me wanna have a wicked persona
Beating the hell up outta people making me mad mayne
Gave me the gun when I ran up in dealings in ninth grade, with a slight rage
I was ice age, another reason Tecca Nina won't have any light days
Voted me the King of Darkness, voted me to be really heartless
All up in my spirit they march, they making me start sparking at the targets
Woke up today I was steaming, 'cause when I found out I was not dreaming
Because the host that influence me the most was a goddamm demon...

See it's a demon inside of me and I'm thinking it's that dope

I ain't worshipped Nathan, so why you gotta see'em?
When you look at me is it the Imagery?
It's gotta godly evils not my energy
I pose as angels clothes is mangled
Instead of girbeaus and Kangols, the ho's still dangle
I chose the angle of souls who tangle
With foe's those who stain yo brain so bane though painful
Shit is what they like, hit is what they might
Spit his stuff in life, shit is fucking tight
But some people think it's an evil experiment
Some people is fearing it, those who do Beatles is hearing it
Sincerity is neezle sin,
People who look and never listen they thinking that I'm the tyranny of evil men
But I just tell it like it is dude
My life story's quite gory spitting even if it is rude
So ain't no brimstone I ain't Jim Jones
So put your grins on listen to them songs
And you will see that they be classics Verbal Gymnastics
You call me Lucifer go to hell you bastard
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick
And I'm on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
'Cause I am not the everyday
I'm not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
And those who know me
Yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell
Hot Christians pop my disc in
Stop the dissing, squat and listen
I never say hail Satana
I'll never bail out and sell out and sell gay drama, Hey mama
Tey trying to crucify me like Jesus
Religious groups deny me like skeezers
We mic pleaser's rip it and write heaters
Niggas that ain't pleased with quickness are light readers
I said 'Anghellic', then let the man sale it
I let the fans smell it, then I expand relish
But the devil tried to stop me that's JCOR
They thought I'd crumble when it's rocky and stay poor
Deus Vobiscum we players go get some sprayers
And hits'em with layers of slayer inscriptions
That mean God be with you we split dude then hit you
With pistols whip you then giggle never dissing nizzle again
I talk about the rain, I talk about the Sun
I speak about the pain, I speak about the fun
I'm saying that I'm bad, I'm saying that I'm good
I'm saying this to the suburbanites and every hood
Yaw act like I'm saying
(I love Lucifer I will kill all of you)
Motherfucker I ain't step into the limelight
To devil worship in front of kids, get yo mind right
They call me Devil Boy, but I don't like that
Those who recite that, that's where the fights at
'Cause I;ma tight cat, who hella write rap
Even a slight crack and I'll be right back
To the Devil worshippers at my signings thinking I'm narly (huh)
I just wanna go to your parties
So I can run through all your goth bitches and rock bitches
Take'em on the block and now they 2Pac bitches
I love the dark side with horror got archives
I'm sure you got hard lives, Missourah is our side
And it's hella depressing hella stressing
Retrogression back to depression a hell of a lesson
This where it gets more sick, don't respect poor pricks
Who listen to this album and then say Exorcist
You dense, hence the word Ang it means good
Hellic it means bad you didn't catch it you should have
Idiots make me wanna bust it (rebel toys)
Tried to explain now I say fuck it (several ploys)
Foolish title I can't touch it (devil boy)
'Cause I talk backwards (suseJ sevol uoy)

The beaches and often go, where we eating we rock 'n' rollers
Deep in the thoughts we go, but no Tweetin she lost her mobile
And geekin because we showed her, freakin' across the globe
In the weekend we off in Boulder, Colorado
All my soldiers got a bottle
And some hoes with a wobble
From sticky dough's you hella bobble
Head bitches they model
And let's kick it Colorado's
A red district full of brothels
And med fixes
Yo, we gotta hide, just see, we get no privacy
Why, would she ride, with me
Tweet, and straight lie to me?
I don't know. What?
Who, she sleeps with
But, all I know is: 
Do what I told you, I told you, I told you
Do what I told you, I told you, I told you
Baby I would hate to
Kick it and then erase ya
Cause you wanna go to
One of those social networks
And go state the
Facts about my nature
I gave to see you later
(Ooh) this bitch is shakin the table
Pissed at me cause you wished it be
Listed with a Twit Pic sick at me
When ya missed it you scripted me
When I gotta move invisibly
You violate it, you fly away it
Simple 'cause I am stealth
Then formulate it, we tried to made it
Keep it to your damn self
Get our nudie on, quiet, we can truly bone
And I'll be pushing all yo buttons like movie phone
Act like you belong, creeping in my groovy home
Drinkin' Bou-Lou we go on every weekend on my groupies owned
Way of life, keep it neat trick
If you and the beast mix, you don't see shit
And you will get the least bit of resistance
We pick who we see fit, but yo

Do what I told you, I told you, I told you

Please, drop to ya knees, ya cannot leave, not a thing
Put away ya phone, 
And don't be flickin like the fuckin'

72,Drowning,2013,Something Else (2013),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Life looks different down here
Inside my dying prison
If I could reach the edge of this
I'll take it somewhere if I could
But I am slipping under water
The tide oh it's pulling me much farther
Maybe I am drowning, oh I'm drowning
My Tsunami, my Katrina and my inner Sandy
Man it will not simmer expanding
If I swam seem like I would slam the damn thing
But I'm scrambling, falling like I damaged my hamstring
I'm deeply disturbed, so many things keep me perturbed
Inside of me peeping this surge and I'm completely submerged
My data wiped even if NASA had a sight
Couldn't catch it with N.O.A.A.'s ghost satellite
Storms at five with them I'm torn alive
Hearing the horns from high
Pain is for sure my eye
Having a lot of blackouts
Medics try putting me on medicine
But I need light
Just like the East need con Edison
I'm dead again
Drowning and everybody else is messed when
I got troubles that's been pulling me down
And jesting, water no breath in
Look how it swept in
To evacuate or not evacuate?
Is the question
But I am slipping under water
The tide oh it's pulling me much farther
Maybe I am drowning, oh I'm drowning
Teach me to swim, keep me from them
Eating the limbs and other body pieces from him
I may be wrong not to, play these songs, caught ya
When you got me drowning in my own Davy Jones locker
It's caving in, it's over weight
No saving him, he's freeloader bait
And everybody picks him than sticks him
But your rain and winds equal my shut down system
Yeah
But I am slipping under water
The tide oh it's pulling me much farther
Maybe I am drowning, oh I'm drowning"

You can't find this in ya big book
Never heard before
My crew bitch look
Hellurr, straight crown and a burrr
And after I'm finished you know I'm a drink some murrr
But I got 20/20 vision when I'm pitchin, listen
I spot them chickens never slippin like a transmission
You like Baileys, I like ladies, I'm quite crazy
And maybe a little shady to hit tonight baby
Cookies, I gotta bang, they wanna hang, with a real nigga
All day, everyday, by myself, not a gang
Wanna go night-night nigga
I'm a so nice I lit up, like a swisher
I don't know why I bit her
We won't stroke by my ni-nuts, Papa getcha
Wi-wi-wi-witch if you hide the puta
Away from me then you can blow me, like a hookah
They know I'm a crowded prusta
On the pooty tang, ya booty bang
And I wish I was your loofah
Ooh, you're sweeter than Dean and DeLuca
Trying to boost ya, this my number that I shoot ya
So hot I need a fan on me (uhhuh), everybody wanna land on me (uhhuh)
So c'mon and put ya hand on me (uhhuh), now what's damn with a wam on it?
Dwamn! like bam like blaow like
Dwamn! like blam like wow like
Dwamn! Say bitch (say what?)
Okay Ma'am, that's enough to make the whole spot say ""Dwamn!""
Sound like when somebody get hit on Batman
Always looking for the pussy - CAT-scan
Booty's always being watched - black man
Never be caught messing around in the flat-land
I solemnly swear to beat punini
Jiggly jello off in a petite bikini
Women wating in line to meet my weenie
Wanna see me go Gandolfini
Won't you let me reach the creamy
Ain't nobody got time for that
But I got time for getting you behind the clap
Dwaaaaaaamn!
Brian Dennis made nina put the dwamn on the DWIIITCH
We drinkin'
We thinkin'
We linkin' with ladies 'cause they winkin'
Now I can say ""damn"" but that ain't big
Saying ""dwamn"" say you seen a whole lot dick
So hot I need a fan on me (uhhuh), everybody wanna land on me (uhhuh)

I cross my heart like a p-coat
If you bring it here I'm a throw c-notes
Let me flow of in your water like a sea boat
She choked, guess she didn't have a deep throat
Dwamn is when it's impressive
Dwamn is when you seeing some one on some next shit
Dwamn is when you listening to nina-tech spit - that's it
But look on the big rump on that bitch!
Girl I ain't seen in a while
No longer teen in her style
Butt seams and jeans in a blouse
Like bam. Like blaow. Like blam. Like wow. Like dwamn."
74,Dyin' Flyin',2015,Special Effects (2015),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Is it true, I can only fly so high?
Then, then without wings, I truly die
If you trace it back to the beginnin'
I never sold a single piece of music before Mitch Bade
This laid, the foundation for me to get paid
This day, you can still hear that gangster on a sick page
Now I'm flyin' high but dyin's, my
Fans that were buyin' I
They're cryin', ""Why
Does he have to get bigger and flow with artists from mainstream?""
Good music reaches all and he's creating a strange scene
How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?
You love me?
You love me not?
I'm flying but I'm dying faster
Hoping you won't go away
How the hell are you sayin' that all the records I'm playin'
Since 2010 are not obeyin' the Strange Law
Remain raw, give your happy and pain all
Spit with a flame jaw with the teeth of a chainsaw
This what I do when I'm flyin' right off the shelf
And when something musical helps
You can't keep it all to yourself
It grows and grows, always hard never tryin' soft
So how in the world you fix your face to say that you dyin' off
How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?
You love me?
You love me not?
I'm flying but I'm dying faster
Hoping you won't go away
Ah
Frustrated, 'cause I'm thinkin' that if enough hate it
It'll make remaining fans start feelin' their trust faded
I don't wanna die (I don't wanna die)
I just wanna keep my lifeline
And that's the family who recite N9ne's passages
And back it just cause ain't no other like mine (tight rhymes)
And even the people applaud
They still wanna bury hard, 'cause they don't wanna be a god
I'm higher than the stars now
The bottom is too far down
Whoever throws sand at the Nina
Yeah it kinda cuts but it ain't enough to take me down
I've been so true, so things I do will go my way
With the power of the pen, the paper, the people do as I say
How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?
You love me?
You love me not?
I'm flying but I'm dying faster
Hoping you won't go away
My fans are my lifeline, so it kills me to think how they can just cut off--
There can only be one
Thou shall only be me
When the whole world's changing
All shall remain (x4)
I'm flying higher more and more everyday
But lately, I've been feelin' like I should just fly away..."

First entry for Sickology 101: Dysfunctional.
Yeah
Don't you bring me nothing stupid,
If you don't want me to lose it.
Step back if you don't want me to attack -
I'm a beast, better give me the deuces.
I have no tolerance for nonsense,
Get away from me.
Me don't wanna get dollars,
Don't wanna holler but you makin' me.
I'm a little dysfunctional,
You're the problem, please don't awaken me;
And I'm that way 'cause back in the day
Most have forsaken me
Ladee-dadee, I'm at the party
On a drunk night with a punk
Mic dude tryna pick a fight because he's sorry...
That he ain't Gotti like I be
'Cause he sloppy, not me
Costly rocks be spot free
But he don't know I'm roguish
Surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded
Will explode if you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo
Listen, they call me genius, I run the show!
Woman be on my penis, it's wonderful!
Demons think they the meanest,
But I brung the foe on the flow
Little bit sick, don't you know?
(Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko)
I'm a little dysfunctional, don't you know?
If you push me, it might be bad.
Get a little emotional, don't you know?
You could fool around, and make me mad.

Get a little emotional, Don't you know?

Don't make me mad.
(Big Scoob)
Born to hustle,
I'm a product of environment.
The game done changed,
So I've been forced into retirement.
But I make moves and I paid dues,
And I got common sense;
Since I can't lose and I can't choose,
Then I'll come back to spit.
I got hit songs, but I've been gone so long that I don't fit.
Near death, dethrone but can't get on
So I need me a lick.
I write these songs, but don't belong,
I'm on some other shit.
I'm huntin' leads in desperate need,
I hope it's comin' quick.
I wrack my brain to find a lane
That's gon' bring me some change,
But it's so strange, my life has changed
And I am not the same.
I come around but since I'm down,
It feels uncomfortable;
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional.
I never learned to hold it in,
I gets emotional.
First implode, then explode, I am combustible!
So please don't push to play me, pussy,
On some real shit, won't be defeated.
If I'm heated, nigga,
Oh shit!

I ain't no killer, but don't push me:
Qu-Qu-Qu-Quiet boy never been no pussy.
Could be carrying something up under my hoody.
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all -
Or would he?
Now I wanna be peaceful,
But I carry Desert Eagles wherever black people are,
You know how black people are.
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out,
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out.
Emotions get the best of me,
Messed up and then y'all get the rest of me.
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny.
I know y'all think less of me
'Cause I'm always sick and I can't let it be.
Pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe,
It's gon' be the death of me
I need Depakote just to coast,
Why I keep throwin' them pills down my throat.
Dysfunctional, blunts will do,
Smokin' Bombay can give me feng shui,
But I wish that it all would go away.
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ
To just un-pretzel me?
Tryin' to pray for change,
But sometimes it feel like He lets it be.
So I just take another couple doses,
Probably be fine, but if you get too close
You'll find out that I...

Evil brain, angel heart
Evil brain, angel heart
Fucking right, I'm a maniac and I'm loving it
Call me anything but my motherfucking government
I can love a bit, no, a big my love'll get
But in my brain I stay insane and I'm always on some other shit
Really wanna fuck a bitch, 
 can't get enough of this
See me take what I stuck her with then I gotta run and give it to another chick
Gutter trick, suck a dick, State the texture of a brick
Making them Magnum rubbers split, what a prick, the brother's sick
Now back to my love, like to go there
Even when it's annoying like long nose hair
I can so share my heart in the cold air
And it's no fair, the size of it is so rare
Bloody murder, muddy word of wretched death rhymes
Take me light and my darkness will take your breath time
Call me chakra-tease or you can call me Tech N9ne

Psycho bandit, I've become a frightful damagin' scud
Missile, you Mitchells are misinformed and mixed in the middle of my menace
Murderous, Michael Myers' my mimic
Mom, you made a monster, I'm making minions in minutes
Money motivated mishap, Asmodeous monikers mended
Feel like I'm on Molly, heart as big as my body
When a hottie gets naughty, it's racing like a Ferrari
My obese heart swelling when it beats hard, telling me
To freak, not willing, like a beast I'm yelling
Bloody murder, muddy word of wretched death rhymes 
Take me light and my darkness will take your breath time 
Call me chakra-tease or you can call me Tech N9ne

My heart, smell like, vanilla icing
If slicing my chest open, a light beam of nice things
Of Christ brings bright wings, placement from thy king
Night, seems right around the corner in my dreams
Horse shit, piss and human puke is this smell
To whom ever wondered my level, this is hell
Inside my crown I kill a gangster with fecies pig tail
And I'll live 137 years like Ishmael
Yeah...nigga
It ain't misspelled
, there go creepy A. Yates
Using women as a bait, and they face, 
 fishscale
Just another nut, all the others suck
Sweet as a buttercup and fake as a rubber duck

I told 'em I ain't know you rap nigga you cold blooded
The way he busted his flow on stage wasn't slow was it
My nigga was flippin, he grabbed that mic 'n' was rippinin
Until some idiots was trippinin, then I heard bullets whistlin
Coulda slang em, I just wanna celebrate he laughed 'n' said
Hes writin a song called reno 911 straight on they ass.
As far as words go its crazy, remember the last I heard EMJ
On this emotional musical journey.
(Hook - Krizz Kaliko)
Come ride with me... Is it sad to see still ride with me
So join me... let me share with this world as I live out the dreams
We won't be gone for long! I promise you won't be alone!
If you lose me frightened, words of this song, remember michael jones.

""Yo... this is OG Muggs, for a shout out to my man MJ,
God took you away, it was too soon man
Your up there with the angels lookin' down
And watchin our world right now brother.
We love you, we miss you, We'll never forget you MJ
Rest in peace brother.""
(Verse 2 - Irv Da Phenom)
That was my nigga, in the bunk right across from mine,
Crackin' them jokes like all the time, hoppin on stage wit 'em every night
And why... niggas would ever wanna take somebodies life
Who's livin' like a shinning light man all the homie ever did was smile
I still don't understand it... don't think I ever will
Why I couldn't have been the bitch nigga that god had let get killed
Instead he took MJ away it's safe to say I'll see your face again someday
At pearly gates but I hold you in my heart until.
(Verse 3 - Kutt Calhoun)
At times I'm like, ""YO MJ WHERE YOU BEEN??"" (Where you at bro?)
I know you lookin' down on me like, ""Here I am Kutty"" (I'm right here boy)
And I ain't votin for nothin' homie, don't wanna do nothing for me
Your love is enough in store in its glory, or so pore me a drink
We can cheer 'n' toast givin' thanks to I,
You didn't lose a partner, you gained a gangster for life.
In your heart I exist but the music I'm able to live
I see the way you floss me all on your wrist, and that's what's up mane.

""On my highest day my nigga you was there,
Now I'm on my lowest day 'cause you not here...
I miss you my nigga,
Love you MJ""
(Verse 4 - Dernz)
I seen a cruel bitch, met her in Reno Nevada
She'll have you livin' your dreams, then take 'em all wit no problem.
In dark ally ways, where devils wait for the shootout
At someone who's special I told my family about em
I saw his first door, he told me tech was his hero
And watched him from the crowd, till then go rock the same theatres
Step out of bounds and rounds can fly, behind casinos
On the night I never gambled and still lost it all in Reno...
(Verse 5 - Wrekonize)
If I only had 8 bars, to come an deliver to you in the grave yard
I'd say god is shitty for even releasin you behind the 8 ball
The pains hard, I know you got kiddies to carry your name on
But I'm prayin' for em, so they don't end up just singin' the same song
I'm hearin it my ""sleep"", I'm hearin it the ""head"",
This whispers on the beat, screamin MJ where you been?
I promise you everyone out here shed tears, until he remembers
Hi powered mayhem, MJ Mayday's 7th member.
(Verse 6 - Stevie Stone)
Remember like it was yesterday, show up in reno
Off of the bus, and to off a bourbin then we hit the casino
And they we, we did the show an we was ONLY
It was all that cryin, you 'n' rock was all that homie
Never should have left you lonely, you took six to five day
Talk to you a couple days ago still ridin', No one never thought there was
Complications risin', a blood clot inside em. MJ DIED I'm like...
""MJ [?] We fucking miss you bro.
MJ, what can I say man, rest in paradise.
Rest in paradise pimpin', we love you.
""Michael Jones, I miss you my nigga""
(Verse 7 - Jay Rock)
MJ still tryna cope wit this, still can't believe that you gone
And I know I gots to be strong, revise mindset the lord
So we gotta let him take control
But lord knows that I wanna grab the gat cock back
Land a blow and watch heads roll,
You was intelligent man, I watched you gravitate fans
Shouted out where you been, people was all in a trance.
Then we stepped off stage, you say you killen 'em rock
Then I say you killen 'em MJ, then you say lets put on [?]
Your strenghth is OX, in a bed just layin with shots
Laughin' an jokin, meanwhile I'm goin' through emotions
You tell me, Jay rock you gotta keep goin' when all daddys broke
Your alblum about to drop, plus you can't be slackin' bro
Ya fo sho my nigga, I know that's a minor set back
But you told me keep killin' on me, it'll be all right
Imma be back, no time bet that.
Then I got that phone call it was bad news at it's best and it hurt me
That I lost my friend on this emotional musical journey.
(Verse 8 - Magnum PI)
Hold it, roll up the swisher, light up 'n' paint a picture,
Only if painted different I woulda been right there wit ya,
So instead of crying I rejoice 'n' pore out some liquor,
Henni straight, I mix it with lemonade,
Feel like I should be ashamed, I had to look your moma dead in the face
She told me errrthing was goin' be ok
You told me if anything you should be on your way home any day
Soon as we all relaxin the phone rang, heard her sayin' (I'm goin' crazy)
Its crazy I'm thinkin' maybe just maybe I miss understandin what your lady was sayin'
Na na you can't be serious, stop your talkin' delirious.
Got my mom on the phone you already know where his spirit went
So I drink that hen till there no more left, right that wrong 'cause it don't go left
Right this song try not stress, gotta be strong yet fight to death.
As far as visions go that's that was last way that I saw
EMJ on this emotional musical journey...

Because I hear different you label me a weird nigga
I like that, and I like mixing dark and some clear liquor
For the night cap, although we ain't the same I cheers with ya
Then I'm right back, listning to doors records
While I get groupie whores naked
If it's a blood and gore message, in a movie I'll sure catch it
My brain's a vorplex it, got many levels, your message
Make a nigga want to ignore that shit, y'all pissy poor, that's it
Intricate bred I'm a bit, pompous, if I want it, that I'mma get
While you're mad at your bitch
Cause you know she at the back of the bus kissing the tat on my dick
You gotta be sick, then I had her, thick anatomy, hit with the flattery tricks
Stagger these raggety battery pricks
Snake and bat ain't average, that'll be quits

Dear secular listeners, we're here next to ya
Giving you fear messed with original weird stress for ya

I know that my style is diff'rent!
Meanwhile I get frowns and lips bent
He better know, we let it go, flee, never throw, glee at a ho, see that a pro
Will make the sounds breaking down the distance
I get my psyche blown, when I sit and write these songs
Then I fuck with my Nikes on: 
To the women it might be wrong, cause in the middle of the night he gone
And the wife of the night she's home: 
So many sicknesses that I get medicine, I get it up off a nigga
But it can never disappear, I know many get with this
But it's a couple of really stupid individuals looking for the N9na fate
'Cause I innovate, and I be the Yates, they can disintegrate
Guess my sin it begins with the number before ten
And being a clown, always been and raised!
When I rhyme my design isn't mindless
You can find Tech, flowing up the divine stretch
Never spineless, spider K's a rhyme vet
And we ain't the only earregular since I got Stevie, Mayday and I signed Ces

Giving you fear messed with original weird stress for ya

79,Ego Trippin',2010,Bad Season (2010),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Verse 1: Tech N9ne
Ey, by now everybody breathin' should be into this
With us even have a membership lovin' me when I begin to rip
But there be some that when I hinder the sinister nemesis
'Cause I'm grim a bit, I am at the end of what I'm finna get
Intricate I'll finish it witta diss fun of his but I get no benefit
I am not a demon 'cause I'm always beamin' in on some sinner shit
This shall replenish this menace in glitsed up men've sit on my syndicate
This genesis will spit and diminish shiiiiit (Chorus)
Chorus: Krizz Kaliko
I done took all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
When we bust they clap their hands *Blast, Blast* Clap, clap till their hands are sore.
And possibly could you be afraid of me (afraid of me)
Be careful who you're fuckin' with, boy don't let your ego trip.
Verse 2: Tech N9ne
I can't stands no more like I was Popeye
Then I got my spinach and now the industry dropped by
When I rocked a spot my plot's to be shot high in a dark sky in hops I... will not die
They really are scared of me they said that T would not fly
And credit was deaded but he kinectly sped up and guap rised
Off the top I - will not lie
Bread is my fetish and I really get it that's why I'm a dreaded hip-hop guy
So stop try, do not pry and me won't have to bring the glock by nigga hot fry
Did ya mami witta soft sigh lost why?
Because the jammy did her man like standing on pot pie
And now I keep bitches that'll make Dennis Hof buy twat
I be so paper that it make the cops spy
And now the haters tryin' to mock my walk to the top dynamic and they not I
Boss N9ne!
Chorus: Krizz Kaliko
I done took all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
When we bust they clap their hands *Blast, Blast* Clap, clap till their hands are sore.
And possibly could you be afraid of me (afraid of me)
Be careful who you're fuckin' with, boy don't let your ego trip."

Blood thirst in the church now The earth's the worst

Don't hire me But you arrest me When I'm selling my dope
So who's the EinsteinIn N9NE N9NE TECH N9NE

Dun, dun, dun, dun!
(Tech n9ne!)
That's how I know my real fans are in the house!
I love you, Kansas City. You fuckin' supported me.
It started here first, nigga. Then it spread everywhere else, nigga.
You are the reason that I go everywhere I go.
You took me to Switzerland. You took me to Amsterdam, nigga.
You took me to Australia. You put me on the fuckin' Paid Dues Festival.
You put me on Rock the Bells with Damien Marley, with fucking Nas.
With everybody. Thank you to all my fans!
I was down on my luck, out of my bucks, growl in my gut,
While in a rut, how I was smilin' while fowl was pilin' on up.
I was proud and I bust loud 'n' enough to rally 'em up.
My style it shouted, it was rowdy and rough.
Such is life, when the dope ain't sellin', the soap ain't smellin' right.
Dough ain't swellin'. No hope, but nope I ain't failin' tnite.
Entered a contest with nothin' in my palm.
Just a microphone and God next to Tech to bless an I'm set.
I won. The people voted for me to take the pay.
Was fate the way it happened, the show fell on my graduation day.
So I chose the show, to go open for,
E, PMD and Kwame, that's how it was supposed to go.
I didn't know I was chosen, never expected it,
But these people saw it while them other haters rejected it.
I toured through the hardest part of this art when most neglected it.
I poured my soul out onto the paper and you accepted it.
You are my heart. You are my soul.
I thank you for all you've done for me.
You are my heart. You are my flow.
My fans made it for everyone to see
(x2)
(Forever Accepting N9ne's Soul)
In Kansas City, a lot of fans is with me.
Started doing shows with crazy flows and it expanded quickly.
Tech N9na's band of hippies ran the shit, we handed strictly,
Outlandish scripts, we damaged Emcees, ripped these calamitously.
And I didn't have nothin', not a cent to my name.
I just had bus'n, I just spin through my brain.
When I went through the rain, y'all invented my lang.
Because you went to the strange events to seek strength through my pain.
You saved my life. Damn, you made my life grand.
I loved these times with y'all even though it made my wife scram.
Because of all the time I spent, I grind for thine and rhyme again.
I'll sign your skin and find a friend tonight, different kind of kin.
Technicians, Juggalos, Juggalettes, Kottonmouth Kings and Kweens,
Gang bangers, college kids, metal heads they've all seen the dream,
Of me being the king. This almost brings a stream of tears.
Meaning I'll sing to all of you that's been on my team.
You are my heart. You are my soul.
I thank you for all you've done for me.
You are my heart. You are my flow.
My fans made it for everyone to see
(x2)
(Forever Accepting N9ne's Soul)
Took me overseas to Germany, Sweden, Australia,
Switzerland, Amsterdam, and Paris I'm seein'.
Fans in red clothes, in Norway and Spain.
In Monaco, we honor those that rep the Strange lang,
Couldn't ask for better life or better fam, yeah.
My fans, they set us right so they get a jam.
And, all of my heart and soul and confusion,
Ready to start the pollution,
To bring my art from illusion to me rulin'
And I will never let you down, I swear to you
Industry beware, the clown is up in here to scare a few
And stare at you with a glare that choose to square
Who is not aware of Tech and Caribou.
But all hail the fans, I'm always there for you.
I didn't know I was chosen, never expected it,
But these people saw it while them other haters rejected it.
I toured through the hardest part of this art when most neglected it.
I poured my soul out onto the paper and you accepted it.
You are my heart. You are my soul.

Back stage, before I go on, and I hear everybody screamning my name like,
""Tech N9ne, Tech N9ne""
It trips me out, like, I can't believe this is my job.
Still to this day. When there's 60,000 people out there,
No matter how many people out there, I fuckin' love it.
My fans, what would I do without you? I love you

All lovin' it's never no hate,
A whole 'nother level of Yates,
How there isn't when the brain of a rebel create
A fellow with a peddle to break
I'm settled but this devil is awake
When it's applied
Something from deep inside
No longer sneaks and hides
It awakens the beast and prized
Through ligaments bones and through eyes
No reminets known as true shyness
Real men thrown in to die
Given it moments to rise
Then a metamorphosis happens like a lit torch
When it's rappin' hyped and its warped
And it's fashions to bring forth war
And it's passion
Laughin' wickedly baby what's happenin'
Where smashing ass yes that humble guy is a has been
And no they can't
Come make me stay saint
When I get that on I black out it feels like I may faint
Then I feel invincible never come to kid or play prank
I say what the fuck I want and do what I want to do behind my

Brian Dennis painted my face back in
The day like '94 look now ain't it my taste
I know a lot of motherfuckers think he tainted my faith
But I keep that cross on me I pray and it just ain't at my grace
But I ain't perfect
Give me paint and the mic and I'ma merc it
Kent Clark's within me, when I'm up he has no purpose
Techa Nina the king that will bring the circus to the surface
Shaken the planet earth is a curse if you never heard this
Technicians started me juggalos they spotted me
Allotted me their land to expand this cultural odyssey
I'm their wicked prodigy, being strange is the policy
Anybody talkin' nill of my family can swallow me
Scenario the more paint the marry-o a burial for Kent
He's square his ho keep him very low
My appearance to weak motherfuckers is scary though
They can't even think of touching what I put through the stereo
Here's my analysis:
Since the beginning I have been saying that I'm a angel
But since I accepted the ways of the world;
Money, women, I became a worldly angel
But my mother always wanted me to do it for Christ
So I think the angel inside of me is ashamed
So in order to bring you all this rawness I have learned from Earth
I hide behind

I can be who I want to be
And I know its still me
But I'm totally free with my

Why you looking at me like that
Do you really wanna trip or you flip in the script
Do you wanna rap with a nigga
Or bang is a whoop in a rip
I don't eva want us to come the bust and shots, nigga misery can't produce enough cops and a'
Don't know if you wallin' or what?
All you wanna do is free stopping cop
Fan or Foe I don't really know
Off at the show niggas they know
But I look light, was a good night and I was looking like a mutha fukka wanna jack all me doe
Come up to me
My kids would be chillin'
Betta think twice I'm a 5-6 villain
All they wanna talk about
I did it
When I did it
Man I thought I was gonna get a bullet in a minute
You Should be care full how you walk upon us
Got a bonus for all the opponents if they want it
I know they wait for Tecca Ninna moments
Till the opponent be poppin' up and hes you don't it
We don't if they be tripin' or not (NO)
Probably 'cause all of them live on the block
When you rapping niggas know what you got
Toughest ever, when you up on the top
Show some respect when you approach me
Don't you be mugging me
Might have that drug in me
Plug in a nigga, for nearly shrugging me
Ain't nothing wrong with people peeping, Geeking
Where the man hoe
But the grandma so bama, stama
I don't know if you fan or foe
(Chorus Repeat 2X)
We be tripin', we can go
Peeping like hes seeking doe
Want the doe or want to go
I don't know if you fan or foe
I don't know if you fan or foe
I don't know if you fan or foe
Easy, hang and speak and brawl
I don't know if he fan or foe
Now be easy how you speakin' bro
T-Nutty the young flow he can don't be jokin'
Show yo ass and you'll be walkin' off with it broken
Run up on muthafuckas in the open
Makin'em shut up wolfin' with that hoe shit
Fuck the shananigans nigga you fake as a manikin' thinkin' you slicker that lotion
Back off wait a minute, why you lookin' at me like that?
I'm just a nigga with a little bit of fame
But if you get to trippin' then I'm givin' up my gang never catch me slippin' you can get it out your brain mane
Fan or foe sucka nigga try to get his hands on my dough,
But if you really want it come on and try to get on it you can be the opponent chokin' with hands on ya throat
Man I'm a loc, one that pack rounds from Sac Town better watch out for the blao blao black out, black out, black out, black out, ""dddah""
Stay with my killers that be knockin' noodle wakin' the game up like a cockadoodle think you gone catch me slippin' at a show, nut factor click is slick as Chaka Zulu I see through you with all that fake shit, you filled with hatred hopin' and wishin' you was my replacement comin' so vicious you gone have to face it and try to taste it, 'cause I laced it like a tennis shoe and I been a fool
Like C-Bo mentioning X-Rated but this a different interview factors up nigga

Living a bee a bad idea
If it never go home again
Nigga looking at me
Like imma chicken dinner
Looking back at niggas
Like a shot of hennessy
So I gotta carry the four
I don't really know though
'Cause they walking past me
Giving me the eye
When they past me they be asking
When you new shit coming out
At tha picture house
They be huddled up and I think I might pick one out get tha nigga bigger than me
For tha trigger to see
If he tough enough
Make it what he trying to be
But he ain't bad though
Don't know how to approach a vulture
Get to close how I'm post up
Can't even live in peace
And when I eat with my peeps in the place
You in my face with your mixtapes
And if I ain't tryin' to listen to it
We get it to it
If I'm off of that fluid
Then its time to do it
Uh... 'Cause a nigga from out south out the mouth
Your girl be loving me giving me mouth to mouth
(Yeah)
But it ain't fair that the music gotta do on what you wanna do when you ain't there.
And if too softly, softy when you see me out you betta get out off me

Man...
I can't even picture myself
Not breathin
...But its certain
(Verse 1 - Tech N9ne)
I love too much
I love too many to count em
So extras and pets its easy for me to go on without em
Cause everything goes away
Love it eventually gets stowed away
Why does it have to be when you're breathin when even
And then you're heated wonderin why is it cold today
Immortal its fake and impossible
But every time I look up I'm shakin an obstacle
What's gonna happen when time is up and I gotsta go
Beautiful lands are took away from my opticle
It's not that I'm afraid of death
But afraid of the thought of my people laid to rest
They're sayin' there's six million ways of death
But not even money way could fade the stress
Its certain...
That a person...
Got somebody lookin' workin to close the curtain
Or maybe something...
Outta some dream...
With a devilish soul for hurtin'
Sometime I be wishing I didn't love...
'Cause when its away I be missin' love...
Your mother your father your children are livin' to die from the crib then a ditch is dug
From the process...
I get naucious...
'Cause I can't see my death and its causes
Pac he saw it around the corner
But me not breathin is a pound of balogna
I keep fightin and I'm tryin'...
To get right in my mind bryan...
Cause one day I'm gonna see you even though I can't picture the 9 dyin'
I'm flyin...
Far far away from here (n nothin' I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here (I'm wishin I could do without it)

Far far away from here (n nothin' I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here (I'm wishin I could do without it)

See I tried to call for you father
But nobody answered
And I tried to scream out loud
But nobody pampered
But your leadin tomorrow
And I'm just a youngster
I'm deep in the sorrow
But nobody wants to (die)
Now I gotta try to get from pain I'm never escapin ya
Maybe I did to much to you you you by forsakin ya
And now I see a reflection of you off in my son
Cause hes the same complexion of you color of the sun
And now I'm done baby makin' hatin' it to even see my baby sleep
'Cause he gotta die one day or barely deadly deep
And I'm stayin too far away from him
Spend too many days from him
Tears steadily fallin' I'm creatin' em
And it's getting colder you getting older year by year
Never know when you gotta go far away from here

Leaving the planet earth and going forward into the universe
I'm Far out, off the chain, took the star route, I done lost the plane.
Spit the bars out, with the quick of our mouth,
Get the feeling of the tip, and then let them take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out
Find me, I'm off in low earth orbit,
I'm far out now I'm talkin' bout gotta get ready your gravity to come towards it.
I sky scrape jump up in the cloud and absorb it, rain down on you niggas like a storm hit.
I'm headed for money and I'm sure of it, Important.
You know that I'm dumb fresh, supafly, stupid high,
Around business like suit and tie
Tryna get paid like that youtube guy, I'm a one of those dudes, that get to running you dudes,
You gotta give him his dues, I'm incredible ya never gonna fill in my shoes,
Your gonna forget I'm a troop, 'cause I'm a beast when I get in this booth (ow)
Ok, ok they know me now don't they, I'm glad to say,
Techa nina drinking turn me loose like J Obama way,
So you know I gotta do it like I'm spazzin, I really get it crackin',
Never woulda imagined back when, felllas on the block got me rappin' with one of the illist niggas to ever make it happen.
I'm off in my zone, that's that fly zone, I don't give a damn about a hater
I'm gone eyes on the mothafuckin prize,
And I won't get disturbed and come down from my throne,
B-hood full effect strange ya diggin it, we living it up mane it's all about the bigga shit,
Ready for the benefit, hands in the air if you feelin' it.
Why would anybody wanna do it any different
I think I fit this track so perfect tech and nina gave me a chance and I deserve it,
I been puttin' in my work and cuttin' like a surgeon, urgin my people to rebel like an insurgent.
I grab my sword and shield talk on field to feel my enemies pain the look in his eyes,
Surprised realized denied by the stand up guy, you don't really want it with me please don't try.
Plannin and ya archin the romanian guy, damn right dirty you can bet your live
And now it's time for me to make a sacrifice, so leave it like I see it I'm talkin' after life
If this is wrong I can't be right, they want me dead but I stand alive,
Enemies who post like my favorite 5. I duckin at 'em then I wave bye bye, I'm off my noodle ain't I?
And my secret ain't mine and I play fight, ain't white hate night in the daylight,
You don't wanna be the one to catch that stain bright, so please proceed with caution,
And just don't speak too loud, 'cause they go head-huntin in the Mississippi you found,
They say I'm far out I'm a giant in this large crowd, get to fightin with my heart out,
I feel your hatred like the far south. see the truth is everybody wants the money,
But the fake it to make it if you pay ya taxin,
Look at the way I'm comin' out the middle of the map and the tech the track with the ways of the?"
93,Fear,2014,Strangeulation (2014),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(Fear) This was the moment I feared
(Fear) This was the moment I feared
(Fear) This was the moment I feared
(Fear) This was the moment I feared
Reoccurring dream, I was falling
Droppin' from something tall
And Jesus name that I'm calling
This is pretty deep how I'mma decorate the city street
Little bitty pieces there's really gonna be some chalky drawings
In this dream I had, when I land
I can taste the blood, I can smell the concrete
And I can feel my bones crush on a calm street
Dark and desolate, my heart I never get
Another beat I'm gonna be other head to split, my hell is credited
Where the red is in, I'm down and dead admit in light I'm dreadin' this
If we're created of God than predestination
Should not be looked at as odd, when we're blessed to wake in-
Side of a dream, like I've been here before
And we sum it up with some French expression like we didn't hear the lord
So I'm hopin' and prayin'
That I won't be opened and sprayin'
In real life and it's just a dream, and it's not a thing that can sway my view
But my fear is that I end up layin' and ready for decayin'
What I thought was a dream now it's Déjà vu
(Fear)
If I fall will the angels catch me?
Or in it all is it my destiny?
Is there a sound when the ground absorbs me?
Or a dream tellin' me my story
I called up my mother, but who answered my brother
He said ""she real sick but I'm gonna put her on just tell her you love her""
My heart it just fluttered when mama picked up she would utter
""Who is this?"" I said ""Donnie"", but she thought I was another
Didn't even know me, and she's not an oldie
It's the lupus or epilepsy
Maybe the psychosis only
""This your son I just called to say happy birthday""
Not really knowin' me hit me in the worst way
Then she said ""Oh yeah, little Donnie, how you doin' in school?""
I said ""I'm 42, mommy!""
I give my arm, leg, leg, arm, head if that means my momma get better
Toughest thing to swallow is when someone who raised you, they gonna forget ya
I'm feelin' sadness, I'm feelin' anger
Steady praying for a higher power to come down and change it
Rearrange her cause my fear is that the sickness in her mind
In due time it'll make her son a stranger
A stranger to the one who raised us
Nameless to the one who named us
Back to the place where it all began
I'm seeing heaven but I fear it's the end
Taught to have faith in God
Breakin' bread then we bakin' K.O.D
Makin' plenty then spread it abroad
Wash it down with a glass of Shiraz
I try to walk the path of the righteous one
But this life is one, that's full of strife, let's run
To the mountain top
What I'm 'bout to say if suckas starts to thinking this holy name
I denounce then stop
Man, I'm just sayin'
I do a whole lot of prayin'
And I wonder if it's listenin' to Aaron's nightly whisperin'
'Bout mom in the tithe she's weakly payin'
I know it's a blessing, that I raised kids 'cause I got skill
And thank God that gangbang thing didn't bring me hot steel
Now my mom's worse and a lot ill
My fear is that this God I'm prayin' to for my mother is not real
Extinguish me from this world of fire
False teachings taught by liars
Prayers that go in an empty asylum
No salvation from this messiah"
94,Feels Like Heaven,2013,Something Else (2013),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Thinking back to all the bad I did (bad I did)
How I was young and evil as a kid (as a kid)
Ok, I'm better now, I ask the reverend (ask the reverend)
Cause of my hell
Will I go because the life I'm livin' feel like heaven (feel like heaven)
Grown better man still I'm in my gang attire
Does not mean I'm going to be cast into a ring of fire
Does it? If so those words you speak I can't admire
The evil's in my past but today the saint is ire
Get and give a lot of love, guess my 'ologists follows us
I was thug, taught us, now we caught up in goddish hugs
Everywhere we go, there he go, went from very low
To unnecessary owes when he carries flows over the stereo
I'm, on my 7 all because of rhyme
But because I played the 6 once upon a time
The reverend says my worldly ways I need to deaden
But I can't tell because this life I'm living feel like heaven
Is it heaven, or is my head up in the clouds
Is there hell for me, because I feel like we made it out
I put my halo on but then, it done came off again
You don't need eyes to see, that this could be our only heaven
So, if you see my feet up off the ground
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
Oh, if you see my halo falling down
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
It's funny, and when I think I'm up there...
They say I fais le cul to much
But they just déjà vu to much
Caught up in the antics
Yeah I'm tied to you because I was thinking semantics
So is it dependent on what your heaven is?
Or how big your 6 and 7 is?
Everything preaches to you, you decipher who the reverend is
This verse is speaking to the ones seeking peace in any form
Far from norm' imaginations, the brain rains when it storms
You say names then it forms, manifest things that were foreign
To you once upon a time no coincidence is gonna rhyme
Make sense in a normal line
Of words you learned them at the time and they remain timeless
Feeding of the dreams that you promised
Before niggas knew you were prominent and dominant
And all those powerful words that back then, to be honest
Were just nouns and verbs; the looks on the astonished
Are normal by now I seen them same faces when I was in Spiderman pajamas
So, if you see my feet up off the ground
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
Oh, if you see my halo falling down
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
Heaven or Hell?
I never thought that this could be so real
I never thought that I would ever build
My own heaven
So, if you see my feet up off the ground
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
Oh, if you see my halo falling down
Oh, don't you let me tear this heaven down
I remember back in the day I had this song called ""My Own Hell""
It was depressing
But since then, I've created my own heaven, baby!
And it's beautiful!
Incredibly, no one deaded me, when it was lead at these red Dickies
Nobody ever headed me, let it be, said I'm breaded, B
Real light, within darkness I still fight it
But if heaven is love, then this sure in the hell feel like it!"

Here he comes, here he comes
Hey James
(Yeah)
You're killin' us with that wild red hair, bro
(I like to kill people, people like you)
I'm a college student sitting next to James Holmes
His mental light ain't on 'n' the love him like ain't showin'
So I gotta invite him to study at my strange home
'Cause he needs to be flame thrown and repeatedly banged on
Till his brain gone, you think you Bane? I put my fangs on
Then it's game's on, for the pain, gonna break his dang bones
Cause James wrong; get him a hook, to hang on
And drain Holmes veins; get 'em to switch his insane tone
You have entered the dungeon of real killas
Demons that will fill us with drillas and steel millas
He'll pay me with his life, cause this animal's real crazy
Cause this motherfucker don't even care if he kill babies
I wish this would've happen like it happened in my mind
Instead of what occurred in theater number nine
My condolences the families that mourn
All humanity was torn for what he damaged see some horns muthafucker
Burn in hell for eternity for what you did
The depths of hell gonna swallow your ass
Gone, baby, gone, never made the dawn
Never had a fucking chance to turn crazy on
My fire in AC is he stopped ya, shock ta
Aurora Colorado, I got ya
Raa! Dirty Wormz
This is Amityville horror Aurora
I make him feel the flame
For the respect of the families I mention no names
And I can feel your pain; you see the devil's face?
Look at him smiling on trial, this is a closed case
Mister Yates, let him in, close the gate
This is the date for his fate, there will be no escape
Duct tape, zip 'em up, strap 'em down
He's graduatin' here give 'em his cap 'n' gown
Turn off your cell phones, no talking in the preview
It's the last midnight show and you know just how it end, too
It ain't no part two, this ain't no cartoon
Watch 'em start screamin' for god when I put this fire to 'em
This is the murder show, order the blood bath
A psychopath that murders psychopaths' actin' bad
And walk away like I'm Dexter man with my bandana to the back
In all black like I'm Batman
Dirty Worm
Gone, baby, gone, never made the dawn
Never had a fucking chance to turn crazy on
My fire in AC is he stopped ya, shock ta
Aurora Colorado, I got ya
Hahahaha, here's Kali
What you want me to be a killa?
Wish I can fill him with some incredible heat
And no catchin' me slip, I stay on my feet
Call up Brotha Lynch and tell him go eat
James, your brain will be dangling from strings if the
Strangers could change it at yourself you would aim
I wish a nigga would, run up the movies while I'm in there with my kids and my boo
I would be popping them back at you, 'cause oddly they life is through
And I'm godly but might get stupid
Psychotic ain't no excuse, 'cause I'm there too and I can prove It (okay)
We hold him for pressures and it ain't effortless
For Holmes to count his blessings
'Cause he got it in with the rest of us
And I'd love to take his chest off the rest of 'em
Arrestin 'em, ain't good enough, let's make him a vegetable
On second thought, I'mma pray for him (Nah)
Hope the angel of death opens the gate for him (yeah)
Better tell 'em if ya bust in Aurora
All the nation's reppin' snake and the bat will be aiming or ya. (Kali)
In the immortal words of Tech N9ne baby
The sands of time have already begun to pour against you
Gone, baby, gone, never made the dawn
Never had a fucking chance to turn crazy on
My fire in AC is he stopped ya, shock ta
Aurora Colorado, I got ya

Tech N9ne got you

Gotta tell 'em naw, sometimes
Sit up in the record store
Seven hundred fans, man, every one signed.
And it gets so hard telling 'em all please try to form one line
With the player-haters combined,
I don't think you know
How much of a strain it's been
I can't explain
It's insane
But I wouldn't give up a thang
I live with the pain
And resort to brain trippin'
I need a little release,
Something to stop my rage
I really need me a moment of peace

Old enough
Girls that are
Swole enough
Grab your shirt
Roll it up
Even if you an A-cup girl, we can still play touch
If you a B and C cup, girl I bet you could make me erupt
D Cups, be the ones that are driving me nuts
Big breasts never trouble me
If you packin the double D,
Let everyone S double E
Angelina Jolie, let me see those
Beautiful babies I'm all about the tedos
Miss Jackson packin them holy Toledo
Missed the flash 'cause I didn't have Tivo
Ask me who's finer, player I'mma yell Tyra
Little sick in the head, still got the magazine of Elvira
Life is so grand, when you got yo fans
Blasting off they shirts, flashing their Lindsay Lohans
I got a pocket full of Trojans,
We can all get nasty if you flash me baby,
You know the program
Girls in the back, come to the front
'Cause we in need of cleavage
And I've been looking at you,
Yep, you and your home girl
Let me see both of them, now grab a hold of them
Look at what you're doing to me
Now grab a hold of him
Ah, such a nice sensation
You know the dogs been waiting
For you to quickly take off your Vickie
And show me your augmentation
Silicone or saline,
Either way puts me in a day dream
Talking about it gets me way steamed
Baby girl, this regime
When you see me, baby lift it up
Thinking I'm gonna miss it, nigga, what?
If I miss one (back it up)
(Stit elur eht dlrow)
Tig ol' bitties lady
From city to city crazy

I can make it when I think it
Can't mistake it, so distinctive
Man I hate this, man I dreamed it, can't believe it
I gotta' let it go!
(So!) It's on for tonight
(Oh!) Hope this wall is ready for a fight
(Yo!) In this hole I'm reaching for the light

Why you wanna try to take my bill ticket?
I mean real wicked, I seem real livid
I've been filled with it I mean vexed
Un-ex-pect-ted-ness, when everything is the best
I get a minute to rest, but then
A nigga regrets I gets the money
But next I'm in debt (I won, what?)
I mean I lost take green from a boss
Be the things that I dream but
They intervene they get my creme, then I'm off
(Whose they?) They turned the
Motherfuckin' best position
Into a deposition dealing with that will
Make you wanna ex the mission
Never no checks to get to and that's the bitching
How do I maintain my autonomy
With so many leaches in this economy
My moaning is mearly monetary
But the moment it's really gone is scary
Try to beat my high score, but I fight
Forward despite lawyers

Such a negative type lair,
You can never pipe nair
When you've got it in front of you
Wanna do it's a pitiful nightmare
It's like making a baby, you never having it
It's making you crazy
And toting a living human, it's making you weighty
Kick, kick, kick, shaking your lady
Like late in the 80's, got my name
And got to taking the stage
V told the people I got Satan to save me
That's why radio be hating to play me
Everything you gain, only brains you pain
But the fame it fools the blame
But you regain it through Strange
Yeah, never put your guard down
Because I wanna bang, bang, bang hard now
I'm a warhound, never mistaken I kick walls down
To the ground and get applause sound
Because I got even, then I'm lard bound

You said you'd never ever break… down
But here I am sweeping, pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never ever play… to crowds
But I've seen you hoping, to play songs to them now
I've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone
:
We're fragile (Wish I'd have known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile (You're not alone)
If it didn't break before it's… about to (We've been here before)
I don't ever want to change
I'm fragile
I don't ever…
:
Some of the people appointed to give an opinion, never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and… die
N9na be givin' the remedy and… why?
Critics are really the enemy and… I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne I'ma look very mean when a foe
Scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto'
'Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin'
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'ma despise
Never do try to listen
It's real… I'm mad… clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this:
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes I'm

Fragile (Wish I'd have known)
I never thought I'd be so… fragile (You're not alone)

I don't ever want to change
I'm fragile
I don't ever…
:
Tell me that I'm famous, tell me that my name is
Big as Venus, Jupiter, and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favorite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop…
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop…
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building, slanderin' and abusin'
What I call a realist, comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an Uzi
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved should've known my music

Yo, this is for the freaks baby
Petite ladies, even my cellulite ladies
This is Tech N9ne baby!
When I was 5 years old
My uncle snuck me into a drive in show,
Got in without pay
I hid between jimmy and bay bro??
A triple x flick didn't even know what I was in fo, Yo!
I seen some things that made me feel kinda funny inside, I seen some things, that my momma wouldn't want me to see at this size
I seen some stuff,
Home boys in the back was hifin and puffin didn't know when I came of age id be gluttin fo muffins,
Homeboy when I seen this, I really mean this,
I was really shocked
And my teammate was really fiendish
It got really hot,
Feel the blanket a little squeamish,
I didn't want it to stop
My uncle said now taz don't piss yo pants, everybody laughed then proceeded to watch,
Went back to school yo
The next day
Didn't look at homegirls,
The same way
Started askin neighbors can they girls come out to play,
Instead of hide 'n' go seek
Its hide 'n' go get it with no delay!
I grew this thing called freaky all sex in my brain it was the best thang
I cought it when I was young and onery just a baby havin' nasty dreams
I heard it was a zodiac thang they say, SCORPIO's!
Are known to be freaks
I see somethin' lookin' good I say Dwam,
And when I see that ass hop I get gee (get gee)
Time kept on movin and my shell is closed
Fly
Lookin' at young girlies sayin' there tail is swole,
I'm already hopin that hell is cold,
N9ne lost his virginity when he was 12 years old,
To a girl named marlene
Me and her were starving,
Fo eachother
Under the covers
Cooped up like sardines
My hard thing,
Started barging,
Thought it was retarded
When it spit on her
We started to arguing
Heres a lesson to the young folks
Don't try this at home
Don't start it early like tech n9ne
Wait till you are grown
When I was in highschool I would wake up in the morning after id take a shower, id put on a non lubricated condom
Cause it could be on at any hour
In my brain is like a disease (disease)
I see a fine girl walkin' by I wanna like freeze, (freeze freeze)
I ain t gotta let her know I write hits or I got cheeze,
All she gotta do is look into my eyes, get her hypnotized, and watch her open them L.E. jeans
Now a days I'm off up in a dope club
I cannot shake it
Pretty women I wanna give 'em mo love
I cannot fake it
Freaky vibe bitches got me lustin,
That's where you bring us,
Got me lovin' big o butts and
That cunt hole lingers
I still be watchin pornos,
Eatin digornos,
My hormones,
Been runnin' wild
Since the day I was born-o
Tossed ya
Wont get off ya
In the kitchen imma post ya
On the sink we breakin dishes micheal douglas and glenn close ya
Do you really wanna get up in a bed wit a psycho sex fiend,
If you neva wanna do it in the flesh we can do it in a wet dream
Imma get up in yo brain on pain it will be me and you
In a minute
Before I get in it

I repped the mo beside her, we did it show at Granada
Sexy dark chocolate, I think her name was Acua
Young Schooler Hallelujah what I got to do ta get inside the cooler
So I took her back to the mo she rode it like a pony she was O.G. young chick it was better than it was supposed ta be
Was a Mexican and Italian chick named Mexital Marie
For a minute she wondered about the chance she gets to wild wit me
I'm ridin' with her and she had an enormous fart box,
So we pulled over and I fucked it doggy style in the automatic car wash
Later that date she took me to see bait
She bought a nacho plate but only Tech N9ne got ate
The cerebellum was great then she sat on top of the snake
I didn't even see bait so with my other bitch I had to skate
I got contex plus I got bomb ex
So after Grant then it's Kutt and baby I'm next
So we can triple team up and fuck your spleen up
Between us get 3 nuts then you can beam up
Now ya sexual peak is met so don't fret

A true charms tale
(Addicted) wasn't supposed to see the botty, but I lucked up
And Dave Weiner gave Kutt a thumbs up (Keep it real)
From L-A-X to sunset, trunks get, the donks wet
Beyonks let, outta towners hunt, sex for contest
Rican and black, urinary freak in the sack (ol' what's her name)
Janelle, used to let me skeet on her back end at the Grafton
Down to the Best Western, let's turn this camcorder on
Time 4 some action
I've been around the world I ya
Freak so many girls I ya
The women I done seen I ya
Some freaky little things I ya
She was a supermodel I met her in Miami
A video girl whose world was candy
And she said I'm sour on the outside but sweet between the legs
A freak, talked about what got her body hot
Like lollipops and sheets
I replied like, ma, I'm diabetic so I'm allergic to sweets
We continued politicing bout if I got a chicken
And her favorite way of all positions
I listen to her talk, mesmerized by her eyes and the glide in her walk
She was sent by Satan himself
Temptations prayin' for help
But couldn't help it still
Found help in 2 shots and a pop of a pill
We peeled on our way, Blue Fountain room 3-1-8
Close the windows and let the sin blow
Like a whirl wind smoked and joked about each others girlfriends
And it's still a secret mi amor forever imma keep this beind closed doors
I've been around the world I ya
Freak so many girls I ya
The women I done seen I ya
Some freaky little things I ya"

Just the way he approached was so sweet
He let you know you was far away from a (Late night creep)
Mister telephone man when he what'nt with you
Bobby browny and Whitney, you found you a new edition

Arguing his excuse to start sipping the Remy Mar-

In her life in her mind never hate but'll go extra time if need be
Easy for me to connect so peep me
In the club I take her some place we can talk discretely
You're creep free definitely that heats me
Your body's wop bobba lu bop so hot baby teach me

The game were either you can be the player, or you can get played.
Caution, if you do enguage and you lose,
This could result in sever heart trauma or distort your way of thinking.
Play Safely... safely... safely.
(Verse 1 - Tech N9ne)
I-I-I am a game-gamer
Play the part major heart breaker brain changer
Take her thoughts make her start they insane anger
Then they can march, hate can spark, names DA-DANGER
You gotta be fine to get in my chamber
Untamed ain't no shame when I bang stranger
But that's a thousand point, one got it, but the thing drained her
And the game hanged her in the strain of a main claimed her.
Now what you gon do different?
Wonder how well the picture went.
The one I saw was twitcher sent
Saw through mommy like Mr.Kent.
Lookin' like her kissers were whistlin to get liquor bent
Or wishin for me to sticker in a position to dip I get her hint.
A hundred points she gets 'cause we connected
Five hundred points for the number that tech direct texted.
Bonus three hundred if she come over and get naked.
But a stinky crevice took her to nothing, girl take the exit.
(Hook - Krizz Kaliko)
I'm a game
She the game
I'm a playa
You not the same
Who to lose
Who to blame
Don't hate the playa
Hate the game
I can be your super lover babe if you just let me in,
Baby it ain't hard to play the game but maybe hard to win
It's a rollercoaster ride come on as I give it a spin
Play it right you get an extra man babay!
(Verse 2 - Tech N9ne)
Next player she say she's the best slayer
She love when her breasts bare
With hot candlewax that's rare
Six hundred points when she say her and her girl is a sex pair
That'll get you an extra man now we gamin on that there
(Kutt Calhoun)
Baby you doin' good stay on it picked up an extra man
The only way to use that bonus is if a sexy friend
Equally fine as you may join us to pass the test
To slam fingers in and then out on your own personal message can
Skype is so exciting and virtual
When two tight women ignite in a delightfulness of diking in about five minutes
You might just win it yet
But now your girl lookin' up tight with it
Lack of participation got your points steadily spiking
And if five hundred points is important
Then let your mind body and souls free
Keep your opponents from trying to score these
Mighty sluttin up with just seconds left on the board
3-2-1 and on to the next ones cause these bore me
Because
(Verse 3 - Kutt Calhoun)
Eleven Hundred points mommy looked smelled and taste good
But lost it from tellin' it all on facebook
One got a dinner
The other from twitter was usin' a fake picture
And in the end werent none of them winners
Till I met this girl from tagged.com
Got to meet me, whip me, and she be freaky deaky
Got the dinner a movie and plus a repeat.
Highest score ever but I broke the broad
Say you came close but no cigar my minds primed.
(Tech N9ne)
Gamin on ya
Even if you got some good head hood said
You keep the pood fed till the woods dead
If you happen to get into bed with me
Then you'll spread quickly and do a medley of ooh and yeah's with me
And that's a thousand points if you get that
Dinner is a thousand mo you can get it if you with that
Good conversation can prolly get you diamond knickknacks
But a misshap like bloggin about how I did that, give my shit back!

Back it up on me mama
Look what you do to me-ooowee
We do it raw
Gone off Caribou Louy-ooowee
More then super dooey-ooowee
Cheers!
One or two beers and you shap
It's like lean and rock wit it
Only you don't lean and snap
You like left side, right side, hands about chest high
Then you wink at shorty in the corner with the left eye
How you doin'?
I'm off a lil' somethin' leanin'
Weed got my nerves, got a lil' trouble breathin' (breathin')

And that's cost for livin' in
The center of Killa City
Where these niggaz Willy Wonka chop at any man
Who feeling they really raw
Get to pullin' dogs at the dark demonians
Nobody for you to call
When it do desolve
Just a harsh remembrance
You might have got through it all but was too involved
And it's very scary
It's kind of pathetic
Nobody is sympathetic when you dead and buried
We rugged and rigid no pun is intended
And when them thangs go clap
We gangstaz man
We bring the trap
Remember killaz don't dance man

When I was dancer
Back when LL Cool J was walkin' with a panther
Actually dancing was not
But rap was the answer
But with the shap
It was cool for the gangstaz to dance to
Still here we stand with this dance
That spread like a cancer
Cool for the man
Even the woman or the baby in pampers
Dancin' is deep
And it's dirty like the crevice of your hamper
Raisin' your hands up high in this bitch
'Cause you amped up (Go)
Nike, Air Jordan at the bottom
In the middle was a Nautica pair
Lot of erotica there
But up top I got the gangsta black
Doin' the Gangsta Shap
Nigga thanks for that

You don't want to see me go speedy
Bro need to see me flow
Never get this choppin' up out of me
He better see the dough
We be so cold wit' it

Yeah
I'ma spitter, you other cats beyond litter
That's probably why you just penny pushin and I'm bigger
So you hate on me cause you like paper and I'm gritter
With two Bianacas up on my arms like John Ritter
Oh my goodness is they talkin' shit again
When I've been player on the day I became a U.S. citzen
Haters keep wishin I'ma take loss but I'm finishin
Killer but skriller just like Percy Miller No Limits then
I aim for digits, a hundred percent of my people came to get it
He used to be bigger but then became a midget
Taken out of the game livin' lame and livid
So he gotta hate on the next man
'Cause he don't got the money we left em' at the bottom so now he an ex-Tech fan
Get the fuck outta my face and winnin' is not a mistake and you gotta be hot sittin' and watchin me expand
You take falls, I take her and take drawls
They give you the weight stall, they give me the mate call (ooh baby)
You yay tall, love is me but hates y'all
That's why I'ma take all with Pops and the great Wall nigga

To strain hommie I talks a bunch of shit the haters wanna flame throw me, rappers ain't got the

I do this for my partners standin out there on the block
And I do this for the haters on the sideline that not
Despite what they be sayin' I just can't seem to stop
Gettin' this guap I gotta alot partner I'm almost to the top
I gotta cop new watch 'n' fresh grill and new clothes
I'm tryin' to come down candy low sideway on foes
I gotta get that bread it be money over these hoes
Cause my fans be turnin' to foes and harsh words lead to blows
They mad at me 'cause I'm the shit while they just shit
And I get up off my ass and get it why they just sit
They upset 'cause I'm gettin' bread why they layin in bed
Even though I started off at the bottom I'm a hundred miles ahead
They steady be talkin' lyin' on me tryin' to slander my name
'Cause I'm the man man but they washed up down the drain
They hate me cause the hate but please don't make no mistake
They knock me but can't stop me 'cause I'm Paul Wall the great baby
If fraud is what ya sellin
Get the fuck outta here
When they lie you got to tell them
Get the fuck outta here
If they steppin up to me wrong

To all the girls that I loved before
I only wanna love ya more
I know it sounds shady, lady

:
Girl crazy
I know nobody can save me,
From spreadin my crazy love
I'm dippin out with your lady,
To give her some crazy love
Ain't trynna have no more babies
So come for my crazy love
Enough to make her go crazy
'Cause I'm all about crazy love
[Verse 1] 
:
I was born Aaron Dontez Yates
Now This song for Aaron Dontez mates, wait
IF you ever been with me
Had some sex or even kissed me,
Spend some years with me or even a quickie, trip thee
Way I handle the beast In me the peace in me and equally I chief to say the least women are weaker then me
Since I was a little fella, witta me a female-a issabella,
What the hell not 1 but its more like12 let me tell ya
Hella Bitches love me once then love me again,
While ya lovin' me I'm lovin' your friend, y'all just lovin' the sin,
And all that tech time you lovin' to spend, but I ain't tryna be no husband again
Look at all this mug that I'm in,
And all this dirt that I do and this hurt put on you its true
Worse them pepe la pue what it do
To my ladies I remember the message I sent to ya I know ya think I'm a friend to ya but I'm tryna put it up into ya
[Verse 2] 
:
A challenge a ghetto my uncle explained it to me, What
Kick it with bitches the picture that he painted for me
Now that I'm a G I'm bout to go in to depth got low when I crept
What a bitch you niggaz ain't no when I slept (with who)
Sanya Tanya Vanya big booty Sandra Wanda Landa Ronda Manya Vinek and Anya
Ain't just to fill the pound between us
Kiss the crown of my wiener
Once you lay down then you're stuck with the killer clown the Nina
Witness my sickness this itches for the bitches with the quickness
Kisses for misses is cliquish suspicious that I hit this
What they really don't know I had the most ludacris fling with this girl
I think the female is really the most beatifulest thing in this world
They take off their shirt take off their bra
Then let you take off their skirt and panties keep a nigger in awe
In between I'm such a freedom is lovin' monster sex
For them to let you inside them is a fucken compliment
[Verse 3] 
:
The Homie for true he's sick
'Cause he choose these chicks
On the road and let them sut min pik
They telling me I show my wife no fidelity and lost it
Literally my way with women has cost it considerably
Bitter is he who loved then lost with the grudge and cross the moss
In the land where the word lost is boss
So we quest for love and flings with the finest the life can bring to ya
True you two have a thing but ill never ever be singular
Guess you can say it's the angel in me
That got these bitches havin' dreams of mangling me
(I know it hurt and sucks for women when they let me thrust within them)
Why do they lay with the snake
(But can't there stop there lust for venom
But you will not forgive me baby you gots to admit we crazy)
'Cause you bring me your light and I'm just so ditz and hazy
My heart is massive but they want my dick
Bitch you ain't never felt no shit like this so give me a kiss

Ooh way ya ooh way ya heeeey ya
Ooh way ya ooh way ya heey way ya"

I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!
Yep, I'm the one ya heard
Reppin rojo on Jimmy Kimmel had some disturbed
But niggas know that we ruff and rugged so mums the word
Tech N9na face painted look like he come ta purge!
Real scorpio, shoot this thing like a Torpedo
Rock the rip, no remorse we go
Dummy like Mork from Ork, we know
And I say that with the utmost respect
I bust low to death, I must bode the check
It's never enough, no for Tech
So I get sick with it, I make a bitch dig it
Even when I wanna speed it up and I quick-spit it
I get a bit wicked up in a battle
Tryin' to bite a buck, I blabber in his fitted
Killin' music get me spiff sitted, I can't piss when it become hard
So I need a chick to hit it when I kick a lyric
And I'mma murder till I'm on the yard (Murder)
My verbs are like birds that jerk up and merk the weak twerps
You can't hurt the durka
First to, insert the work inside of the earth
I disperse the curse to reverse ya to the worst of ya venomous
Squirt ya mercer (Ugh)
Trip not, you see I got the advantage in hip hop
Cause rappers sound identical so when N9na's shit drop
I do numbers, I'm the pinnacle so never will it stop
Y'all can't beat me doin' nothing, except for
Stalkin' these thoughts I spew and suckin'
We run this independent game, it ain't no screwin' us
When we runnin' everything except our mouth while they blue and sufferin'
This on the Bible, I kill any life with a script from this rhyme
Music's done divine, this is my rifle
There aren't any like it cause this one is N9ne, is a gift from his mind
I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!
Yo, I Got the call from Tech N9ne
He needed assistance from the group with the best rhymes
That spit the heat up off of yo ass and grind
Fuck all of them flex rhymes
I get love in every city I sack in 'cause I rep mine
Around the world, the girls give me head on tour 'cause I headline
I gotta get fed, I'm fed up, my homies is doin' fair time
I look at that clock and all I see is ""Go get that bread"" time
Lost too many soldiers so tears, I gotta shed mine
Turn on the radio, hear yo shit, and oh, it's bedtime
I fall asleep, it all is weak, most y'all shouldn't be called MCs
Bro, ya discography, you ain't sale cause all of ya talk is cheap
Smoke up all the tree, my whip look like it got a fog machine
My crib look like a pharmacy, that's prolly why you wanna haul my team
Livin' facetious, what the hell, why the weed lit
I make change where I see fit
I don't play like I don't see shit
Yeah, one hunnit, one hunnit, keep it that way and it's a poem
And stay away from the hate and keep all yo plays right in motion
Bust it, I'm down after the sun and up before it, better know it
MVP, most valuable poet, been the coldest, kept it focused
Cause you miss every goal that you don't shoot for
And every time you cut a corner, you make two more
The rich is in my life, so I don't have to have the things
And listen for the whispers so I don't have to hear the screams
And I go hard for what I want, so it's just colors when I dream
And then you realize, it's not as scary as it seems
Molly's for pussies
I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!
Ain't nobody handle me, heated like a candle be
Kissin' dirt, ya man'll be for tryin' to dismantle me
Music is my weapon, true, loud enough to deafen you
Never trip with Tech and crew, be careful who you steppin' to
I remember when I was young and I got scars through
Right in back of the paddy-wagons and cop cars too
Now that I'm flyin' high from a rockstar view
Security level let Allahu Akbar through"

Gotta give it up 'cause it is a must plus
I'm fast like a rust bus on her ass we bust nuts
Blast past your city never last the big bucks
Imma gas this pair up pass and kick dust
They try to talk tall but their money is straight dwarfs
And you think its funny but we pull up in the grey Porsche
But you know my stray horse we leave and they face sore
Got the gun in the safe shoot from the waist and the case closed
Don't test me especially when my ass be up on it ? killin' off all opponents
Never slippin never trippin' off money scandalous moments
Either you take it or you leave it if you leave it you don't
Want it I'm a strange individual leaving you suckas to drown
The flows continuous when you get to a ? I'm trying to get the digits now
In a few minutes I'm down to the ground we never knew?
They all get down when they hear the sound
So jittery, they think I'm back on it
So shivery, they be like dan-gonit
So quivery, they freeze at that moment
No liberty for lil' bitty pretenders that want it
Guess what!
Give it up cause' I never let you down (x4)
(Tech N9ne)
You see me get money, honeys everything I wanna really feel like wanna dude see clevage
Funny, dummy if you never heard of me tecca n9na's a beauty peep it a lot of groupies need it
If you are chum if you don't like it then give it the backwards say pu ti evig (give it up) you gotta pootie leave it
So juicy when I beat it feed it mu-le and I eat it like sushi better heat it steam it
Makin' 'em crazy crazy never much to sway these ladies
If you talkin' 'bout me to a bitch and she don't suck a dick she gon say she pay me
Wundershön tech is second to none and that it quit bums your cum but you niggas under crums dustbags
And you trippin' cause you know deep inside your fluffed ex fuck tech paid lebowski
Then wanted permission to suck ces better give it I'm check it I'm bout' to rip it if tech impeccable
Never no better flow when I flip it cut everybody so nigga what evolution is big enough
To get you hickin' up when you're bitching be licking digging nuts death is gonna be the only way
You're cold so sorry I had to give away your soul tecca n9na never ever give it up
For the crown better tryin' later hoe

You never be selling copies
I will
Rise above all of you
Regardless
Of my skrill
That ain't got shit to do
With Techa the
N9NE's skill
Bust on you rapper cats
And proceed to make
Mill
Five Six Vill
I be seeing 'em
Down at Mardi Gras
Getting flows off
Everything getting
Showed off
Not me
Try to mock me
On a record heads
Getting blowed off
Freestyle I admire
But every week
You're giving away fire
Your rappers license expired
Leaving nothing to be desired
Oh God bless
This pacticular rapper in KC
No matter how hard you try
You can't fuck with me
First
Learn how to do choruses
Then try to get people to trust you
Everybody wanna be the special
If anybody say
Fuck me
Everybody say
Fuck you
Get on your
Knees and pray
If you step in our way
'Cause we spray till they decay
Everything you built
The ones who hate everyday
But how long
Must we flash and pop
How long
Must we show demons
We can't be stopped
Get on your
Knees and pray
If you step in our way
'Cause we spray till they decay
The ones who hate everyday
But how long
Must we flash and pop
How long
Must we show demons
We can't be stopped
(3rd Verse)
If I offended you in anyway
Maybe the shoe fits
Either that
Or you're just plenty gay
If you're like me
You don't give a damn
You're just enjoying the flow
To all the people
Who were offended
I'm about to offend you
Some more
Is God
White
Brown, Green, Red
Or even Blue
Is he American
Arabic, Mexican
Or even Jew
And wanna be the chosen few
Everybody wanna be
But they're gonna be
Through
Till
You do right by me
Everything that you do
Is gonna be whack
Is 'bout to crack
Everything you did to me
Is coming back
Nowhere to scat
And I say that
'Cause I know Jesus Christ
And God is Black
And they coming back nigga
If anybody say
Fuck me
Everybody say
Fuck you
'Cause they know my shit's
Pure
Soul serving
And
Plus true
If anybody say
Fuck me
Everybody say
Fuck you
Odd one Tech
Got that God complex
Get on your
Knees and pray
If you step in our way
'Cause we spray till they decay
The ones who hate everyday
But how long
Must we flash and pop
How long
Must we show demons
We can't be stopped

It's time to go brothers, 11 years and we finally here
Beyond the stars, the trinity

Me and Tech an them started on a quest for Ember
Oh any why, we touch'in so many, why? 'Cause we spiritual
Feel'n every syllable we spit out
We angels, that's the way we tell'n demons to get out, so bled out
Baddest nigga represent'n the Midow
Feel'n like the world cannot live wit'out, Ta-dow!
Now we immortal! Someone open up the portal!
Rap is ever lethal when me and Nina was caught on!
We God status, got through a task at us
Told us he make us angels but our missions to kill the baddest
So we gotta blast the bastards with our rap and apparatus's
Never let off the ravage on 'em like cravats on radishes
Who like the Grateful Dead, our fans are the new dead heads
We keep'n every word we say'n like it's a pledge
And when you hear them gods and love how it sounded
When ya see the king kneel to the ground, make a fist and pound it
Who do you believe in? Is it he, is it me? W-E- them G-O-D's

Highly exalted then christen (your souls) those grounded I inspire to lift

There set on all that can reach us, by now were adios
Witness the blessin's beliefs and hopefulness I bestow 'em upon a fan or
Foe
Man or those oppose'n the Chanet growth
I plant it so everyone on the planet can evoke the entity sent to be this
Music industries manifold
I manifested this bitch, suggested that I rose up from under the sheets of
God's baby cradle sent down to pose a threat to messanic rappers protest
Aganist moral lackage, invested in this infested depiction of worldwide
Gibberish
Sss soft no more here it is, a little experiment with Jesus blood and water
When the spirit mix, drink it, it's so refresh'n just like the air of my
Message, The breeze carries and once you inhale it then I will ask you
Who do you believe in? Is it he, is it me? W-E- them G-O-D's

Exalted... Bosses, get off his office with crosses, that's what he fought
With in darknesses losses, no caustic losses cause the brains embossed with
The word auspiciousness, Feed my fam flows fluidly, they would never leave
My land no truancy, 'cause I am the reason they stand for unity,
Unlike me with whackness you give yo fans no immunity,
I am the air they share, I am the heir to the throne where no compare in my
Own zone this lair is home grown, it's rare but it's on strong,
Beware, long gone if you dare got the wrong tone,
Now, we are beyond those who got fame, gave my heart and many souls were
Obtained, so my lane will definitely not change cause G.O.D.S. means the

No matter the money we gotta go dummy, I'm wit' it so nigga what's happenin'
I feel like comin' and do it with passion
Whenever I'm in the booth I'm real as ramen and juicy juice
And the vomit induced when the onyx been poop
Regroup and spin this shit
Learnin' this level of linguistics
Lot of you who lose it love lickin' limp bizkits
And I am done
Tryna shine a star of Donnie to the people like ""fuck this nigga""
Soundin' (will as Farrakhan he?)
Never can raise the bar upon me
I am on par with omni

Not a nigga left, why you triggered then
From the hottest spitta, fought a bigger Tech

The Hostile Takeover, ooh-wee
I met a Apple Bottom, San Jo model, Like to swallow groupie, huh
Wonderin if mommy gon' choose me
Fuck it, let the Grey Goose and Cranberry Tropical lead her to me
Then I'll holla
I'm actin' all non-chalant, you eyeing me
Sort of obli-vi-ous to my dogs comments
You need a mental connection from stress relief (I'll offer)
As soon as the pill kick in
Watch the panty hose fall off her and twenty minutes later
Mommies on E and she can't keep her little groupie hands off me
Now her mouth is around my dick
Then we fuckin' and sex-ercising
I'm in her hole, Off in her soul
Lovin' my extra sized (dick)
Whenever I call, I can hit it
She love some Kutta
Whenever I'm dwellin on that encounter
It makes me stutta 'cause I, I, uh (Dammit)
Won't even try y'all
Pop it and knock yo shit outta socket like Houston's eye ball cause...
You just a groupie (Who me?)
But you mean much more to me
Than just a groupie (Who me?)
Cause the things you do to me
She's just a groupie (Who me?)
But she means much more to me
Than just a groupie (Who me?)
Cause the things you do to me
(Big Krizz Kaliko)
On the road again
I met a lot of groupies
I got a California, Colorado, Kansas City groupie
And ooh-wee, Wasn't supposed to choose me
Somethin' I said to her maybe made her give it to me
Caribou got ya woozie too
Got ya doing things you wouldn't usually do
And ooh, I love women's
Gotta find a way to get'em on the bus and outta their linens
I make'em strip for me (Damn)
It's the shit homie
Treats me somethin' nice
Beast, We somethin' like
Gimme Felicia O!
Know how to do it right
When you see the snake and the bat
Know here yo girlfriend at
Cause every time you turn yo back
She be with them rapper cats
I let her on the bus to braid my corn rolls
But when I start pourin those
We makin' porno's
To me, Ya much more than a S-L-U-T
(She's a groupie)
You just a groupie (Who me?)
But you mean much more to me

(Tech N9ne)
What's sizzlin pigeon?
When I'm thizzin
I need a super Cali, Animalistic, Sex me, Ah la groupie
And I don't care if she fair with the long hair
But as long as we there, bare and I bone
And we share swears on the stairs of my hotel
If they stare at us, Oh well
Cause your boyfriend's waitin while I'm breakin your swole tail
And your boyfriend hates
While he pace, cryin a storm in the lobby
When you get to the house
Y'all fight like Foreman and Ali
But check it
Gave you an autograph on your calf then I dashed
But I didn't know that it'd be a tattoo the next time I saw your ass
She got on my bus, I was like ""Holy shit""
She laid on the couch
Opened her legs and said, ""You owe me this""
I'm the answer to your girls groupie pains
Oochie coochie dames tempt me
When in my presence
They tell me, ""Pinch me""
'Cause I'm exciting baby
If I didn't exist
Sexy female scientists would have to invent me
You just a groupie (Who me?)
But you mean much more to me
Than just a groupie (Who me?)
Cause the things you do to me
She's just a groupie (Who me?)
But she means much more to me
Than just a groupie (Who me?)
Cause the things you do to me"

I didn't wanna fucking do this song for real
But I wouldn't be real if I didn't
(Tech)
I be sittin' by myself and thinkin' mamma what have I become
All I wanted was a family but when I look I be the only one
Losing everything but money everybody left and I don't even get to see my young
Only happiness I get is in the studio and when I get to do another run
On the road, doin' shows, get the woes, when it slows
Gettin' cold, getting old, but the flows, gettin' sold
I've been doin' this a minute but I think I wanna end it 'cause I'm on a higher level when I go
But the music I be doin' it, be losin, make it really tough for me to grow
All I wanted is a family portrait, see my babies on a ranch with horses
But I was fucking devil bitches in corsets. I was livin' really good then I torched it
I'm sorry Miss Jackson, I'm speakin' for real and I never meant to make your daughter cry
But I guess I'm a failure with women I'm lost and I feel like I ought to die
Feel like I'm rotting away, my life is just off in the grey
How much does it cost I will pay, to lay, and be off in a coffin today
I mean off in ashes, this life ain't after a classes, If I get blasted
This is Suicide Letters all over again, I thought that I passed it
But I guess that I didn't, cause this one is written and there is no mending
When I'm broke I'm a joke, when I croak I just hope I won't be descending
But this ain't a joke, I want you to know that Tech ninna is never pretending
Alone in my bed, a gun to my head, asking WHERE IS MY HAPPY ENDING? Ya
(Chorus] [Krizz Kaliko)
Tell me how it ends?
(What about me?) Where is my happy ending?
(What about me?) Is this a life worth living?
(You know how it begins), but how does it end for me?
(Will I ever win), or does He have it in for me?
Will this pop before I stop breathing?
Is their light in this dark I'm seein?
(Tech)
Yeah, I put my life in this music, nina is inside out
I set my heart out for people, they know what the inside bout
Will they keep feelin' ninna forever, this I doubt
Can never cry for help so if you listenin this my SHOUT
I'm searching for the passage way to happiness
But I'm wordly So I have to lay in nastiness
Yes, this is Strange year, worldwide fames near, but the games queer
Sometime I feel like I'm Rudolph, the reindeer
But instead of a red nose, I stay in my red clothes
And the music they said blows, is on top and the cred grows
Can you resurrect a mother fucker that feel like he pose as a dead soul
Deteriorate to an inferior state almost equal to bread mold
Now as my head goes, wish I could shed those
Because all the time the ninna was shorted, what I bled froze
So now that I'm cold blooded, and hella sick is what the med shows
The tread slows, and don't even think you reviving a dead rose. Yeah
(Tech)
I'm on the verge of insanity, but I'm competent
I'm breakin so I pick this one to vent
The reason I look away when you talk to me my brain is producin evilness
I'm drownin in 151 and Rumplemintz. That's how I feel
I sit in the mirror with this gun and practice how to kill
But I know damn well that the people like me really wanna know how to chill
This life is about a check, about a number about a bill
Think about all the love I lost cause my quest is about a mill
I feel like your stupid, don't talk to me I'm crackin' up
And I don't mean laughter I'm full of bitterness and its backing up
And I live with angels, but lately demons been shackin up
Tug of war with my spirit, you see the blood I'm hacking up?
I love my kids and my fans inside I sob harder
Cause you pay the price for my life and its right like Bob Barker
And I won't pretend its ok I'm no facade starter
So I guess my only happy ending is in a massage parlor

Your people down with this label
And I be so bound for that halo when I be low ground?
They want that black magic
That savage with bad habits
Grab at and stab rabbits
The maggot that has cabbage

With swagger that's past average

You was using music as a form of pursuing
Pussy sneakin in her bed and beggin for a screwin
Who the fuck is you foolin?
I can still make her make you put yo muthafuckin mic down

And serve yo ass in her nightgown

Oh..oh..oh..ohh.oh
Hey! hey!
Narsasistic, hard to grip it,
Dark and wicked, arts prolific,
Mars with the stars, this is far lifted,
Lyrics quit the bar with it, bar scriptures are terrific
Get a spitta wit a bit of bitter marketing
With scrilla then a fifth of henny liquor, start ta twist it
Critters sit and shiver in the slit of zillas pit of killas
Gritters hit a click of silly niggas are fictitious
On top of the game I'm droppin' the rain godly gifted
Hop in ya lane and stoppin' your fame bark is vicious
You got bars to witness y'all submissive when I get your brain
Your thoughts is shifted
I'm incredible, highly technical nympho triumph, raw intricate
I need medical then more science, scars and stitches

Been floatin' for years and I ain't landed

And I Yi Yi Yi
Don't know why people
What?
Why people go to the strip club
To spend their dough
Just to see butt
To see these ladies strip
And take off all their clothes
I do not know why
They choose such a spot
I just don't know why
We get hot
It's probably cause
They make it hop and twurk the pole
And their headlights are sitting bold
Makes it look like it's getting' cold
Can I hold you tight
Hop on my lap
And do that dance
I come to spend ones and huns
On lovely skin
Booty weighs a ton
Let the game begin
Cause here I come
Teccanina swope down like space invaders boy
Pull out the piece like on you haters boy
Forget about the haters
I don't wanna talk about 'em
On this right now
I wanna talk about

When the fannie g. drops
Fantasy locked
On makin' the canopy rock
Panties be hot

All vanity pops
In every glam if she's stocked

134,Hold on Me,2016,The Storm (2016),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Gimme some of that good stuff I need so much
I can't handle life without it, it's become my crutch
I don't need anything else
I'm just gonna use it for myself
Been craving it tonight so it's good I've got plans
Soon I'll be flying, oh so high
All my life whenever I got into a relationship
Couldn't take the nagging of women never be taking tips
When they said I just needed one of them in my stable
But never would I listen I wasn't able they say to me
I know you got other chicks, and I'm sick of this shit
You think I'm asleep when you go sneak away for a bit
I hear you talking to her why do you treat me like this
Why do you make it so hard to admit
Player would never show his hand
I become something they can't stand
In the long run they on one, our song's done
Get they bags and they bounce
And they say I'm sick and need a little counseling
You are the king, but don't know how to treat a queen
I hear the words you speak about her when you dream
Thought that we were a team, how could you let her intervene
Guess you got me
Really got some feelings for this one you can't stop me
Gimme some of that good stuff I need so much
I can't handle life without it, it's become my crutch
I don't need anything else
I'm just gonna use it for myself
Been craving it tonight so it's good I've got plans
Soon I'll be flying, oh so high
Cause it will have it's, hold, on me
Her blood is coursing through my veins
I need to hold on tight just let it take the reigns
Don't get in the game
If there's a feeling you can't hang
Women tell me that I should be loyal to one dame
It's a shame, they say I'm a playa and I never change
I remain, how we start out the same
And I can never get with it, you can give it to whomever wanna get it
Now that I'm seeing vivid you come at me I'mma pivot and
Get up out of your room, treat me like a buffoon
I can see you love her to the moon
I cannot lie I'm hella busted, they say I can't be trusted
I ain't got time to love shit but this does it
Loving her even when out in public goes with me wherever I tug it
I'm really done with you yes I had a lot of fun with you
But your many will soon be none with you
So what you gonna do?
Its only one and without it I might lose it
I cannot keep a woman cause time with my music
Gimme some of that good stuff I need so much
I can't handle life without it, it's become my crutch
I don't need anything else
I'm just gonna use it for myself
Been craving it tonight so it's good I've got plans
Soon I'll be flying, oh so high
Cause it will have it's, hold, on me

We been doing this for a long long time now...
This music thing... and touring, y'know...
And still... I ain't met one person that could maintain righteousness
Know what I'm sayin'?
(Verse 1 - Tech N9ne)
A wise man told me evil was lurkin and if you found it
Try your best to not put yourself around it
'Cause when you in it you tend to push it to the limit but
Then when the sin beginnin you wish you would stay grounded
I went all over the world and I done been through it
At the beginning I knew I wouldn't give in to it
But temptation over the sensation
Women I'm embracin, so many of them waitin
Contemplatin how to get fornication
And yo door when its late with the motivation of Satan
So they say, but things go they way
But its more then pay told her hey yo the phase for today
But lust it sets in, and crush your chest in
For dust your destined, if drugs are let in
Enough to nest in, probably make you punch your best friend
And next kin 'cause you let s e x win
You mean to tell me you can fight this land
With brightness and walk the path of the righteous man?
Yo, I want to believe that, itching to see that
If a positive person can shake the negative feedback
That this life has to offer and its faster
What a disaster if you didn't obey the master
'Cause that's mutiny, it would be new to me
If you was on tour with Tecca Nina and you could be

(Hold your only) Your soul and if you know it won't you
(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look up for a

(Verse 2 - Krizz Kaliko)
How can I move the crowd without losin out of my faith?
Lucifer out of the way (way)
Or maybe he don't even exist
I ain't gotta trip
Gettin' hookers out of my system (get you out of my system)
See that's how he tricks em
Let 'em sip then a big ol mickey he slips them (I wonder why)
Music soothes the savage soul
People could lose or win, but lack control
Wish we could choose to live and fast the soul
We smashin women then bypass the soul
They believin everything we breathe in
Half of us is Jesus, the other half is heathen
And how we get that bad half out?
We pray the lord would cast that out
Hope you got blessins let them pass that out
When we travellin and pass that route
Keep us under their grace is the place where we had that doubt
Where I stand, its pointin at me, but its with my hand
I need you, you holier than I am, I am

(Verse 3 - Tech N9ne)
This verse was intended for a gospel rapper that we all admire
And he goes by the name of Da T.R.U.T.H
All we wanted was a righteous man to lead us in the right direction
And maybe if he came we could change and regroup
So we laid it down and sent it hopin' we would rap wit us, track splittas
Waited, and none of his people got back wit us
We kept callin' and they finally answered, when a month passed
We was prepared to do whatever, give it if he wants cash
But the lady who represent 'em would never send 'em a message from a secular messenger
Never be no nepotism, we supposed to be brothers, on the road to teach others
But the flow would be covered, don't wanna mess with Tech they know that we smothered
Anybody who diss us, retire they weak flow
'Cause this is the pinnacle, nobody flyer than me, bro
If you didn't like it then I admire the ego
And if they never told ya, then you better fire ya people
Cause fallen angels came for your help and then she pushed 'em
But Christians be the first to run they mouth about Muslims
But they always helpin in the hood, but y'all closed me out
Y'all didn't even really wanna know what we bout
And we bombay, T.R.U.T.H. ain't on it so the don spay
And I had to spit on in 'cause I couldn't afford Kanye
I needed help, your people showed me the wall
Be lowly as y'all, I guess y'all wasn't holy at all... naw
Much love to the gospel MC
J Blast for coming down in the midst of sinners to try to help us remedy our situation...
Even though most if his peers told him not to
'Cause we secular MCs
Thanks for giving me Da T.R.U.T.H. CD and bringing true Godliness to our circle bro...
God bless you, for being so...

Let's have a par-ty (Lemme get up)
Saturday mornin', I ain't gotta work
Last night's show sold a lot of merch
Bad bitch in my bed so I ain't gotta jerk
Forbes List caught me so it's hard to make the dollar hurt
All we need is good green and some Bou Lou
Five to one so its guaranteed you can do you
'Zilla keep the heater just in case we have a boo-boo
Kansas City natives and we all a little coo-coo
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, ""do it for me, baby""
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
So much liquor, I never spare that kitchen
Keep it so I usually have a pair that's kissin'
And I'm lifted on purple hair, that's bitchin'
Now that's what I call a fuckin' air Technician
Down there, they got the hair that's missin'
Keep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten
I am aware sex hittin' is the care when I share that stick and
So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in, then dip off
Look for another chick, then they pissed off
Till I give them another spliff then they lift off
Party is the mission, I did cross
Three thick friends, we mixin' these licks when
They big friend wanna lip off
So I told her come and get lost, bitch
This my place and it's way too turnt up to trip off shit
Yeah, you my prototype
My fourth foreign car was a Porsche photo white
Cooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice
With a ring, married to the game, had 'em throwin' rice
Wait a minute, put my thing in her
I'm trynna knock up, I'm trynna put a singer in her
So I can do a banger with her
I get brain for dinner
I don't need to put tender for contender
Thank god for strippers
High top with zippers, hard as some nipples
All the shit I do is straight off the temple
Trynna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple
Tell that poodle, ""don't mess around with them pitbulls.""
This the endin' from the N9ne
Grindin' bitches from behind
If you way drunk off the 'yac
Spit it up, spit it up, spit it up
This Kansas City, shit's ran gritty
In the summer time, the chicks be damn pretty
Born in the projects, then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills
This is celebration, this is elevation
Me and my delegation got niggas hella hatin'
This is Nnutthowze, Regime, Rogue Dog
And it's all Strange Music, winners can't lose it, unless
Errbody got they hands up like (Ooh!)
See a bad bitch like (Whoa!)
This whole damn city fuckin' go
But this is how the hood go crazy in the MO"
137,Hope for a Higher Power,2008,Killer (2008),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(Jim Jones)
The world- The Kingdom suffers violence, and the violent shall take it by force. If we can't live in peace, then let's die in peace. (Applause.)
We've been so betrayed. We have been so terribly betrayed.
So my opinion is that you be kind to children and be kind to seniors and take the potion like they used to take in ancient Greece and step over quietly because we are not committing suicide; it's a revolutionary act.
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo what about you (x2)
Grandma told me the good book said
In the last days get ready for the ten plagues
1st the rivers will be ran with red
2, 3, and 4 dead frogs will cause lice and flies
Sick livestock is 5 the living they must fight for their lives
6, 7, and 8 a boil storms, a fire and locusts
9 is darkness so dark it's hard for you to focus
And 10 is death of the firstborn
If I said it was questionable the religions would make it a point
To get at me and battle me maybe have this verse torn
How will this curse form?
Well creationism and Darwinism
Been at it forever but I got nothin' but hurt for em
'Cause really nobody knows when you live then you die where your body goes
If it's Hell or it's Heaven
6 or the 7 well I'll keep the Nina for our be foes in a gamble
That's what life is and it's hard to handle
When the Bible says worship this by the scriptures written by man though
So when man destroys us the word might not stand so
Till that day I'm just gon' protect my fam with ammo
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo what about you (x2)
And at the height of the power, God will send an angel to destroy him.
I've been looking for something supernatural for a long time now
But I never got proof that a spiritural realm existed wanted to find how
Everybody sure of a supreme being, are people just seeing things?
Wondering if we get wings, seems sick to believe in an extreme king
I know it sounds far fetched, every night I put knees on the carpet
Then I pray to who's up with the star set
'Cause the earth in it's self is a target
For destruction, for cumbustion
'Cause there ain't too many you can trust in
Think of all the women losing their husbands
In Iraq a lot of killing and suffering
What I hope for, seems folklore
When the enemy kills and gloat more
'Cause they killin' us off in this hoax war
Then I wake up yellin' and my throats sore
'Cause the fight's there, it's a nightmare
If it come to me I'm in my snipe wear
If a bullet give my lung a slight tear
I wanna believe that the light's there
So all you christians don't get mad at me
I just hope that your mystical, magical miracle's workin catastrophies
And this ain't blasphemy, but artilery is my strategy
I hope for a higher power when I look at all these tragedies
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo what about you (x2)
I will NEVER follow the beliefs of man! Why?! Because man destroys everything in his path!
Oh what a miracle, angels and demons
But the only miracle is that people keep believin
Right hand on the bible, left hand on my rifle
Keep that for my rivals and evil desciples
Expand your mission, man to women
When they attack do you plan to give in
Or do you do like I do and say praise the lord and pass the ammunition
People like us
Piece and knife up
'Cause we got evil to sweep and wipe up
Devils and demons and humans, irrelevant
If they lookin' deceiving I bust
I hope that the higher power is watching over me
'Cause we young people don't see faith like most the older see
If he or she is listenin
A mere sign can spark me me
But if the laws in the bible are bogus
Then prepare for anarchy
Worst case scenario is there never ever was a higher power
So in the midst of chaos now
The only real savior is fire power
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo what about you (x2)

I, with respect, die with a degree of dignity. Lay down your life with dignity. Don't lay down with tears and agony. There's nothing to death. It's like Mac said, it's just stepping over to another plane. Don't be this way. Stop this hysterics."

I'm a nice guy
My lifes a light sky
So Much love I might cry
Not! Nice Try
I'm an evil seed and the day I sleep and the night fly
G.A.Z.E. in my E.Y.E'Z and you might die
I'm a horn dog, gotta lotta of the porn y'all
Warned y'all, I was straight born raw like Ornthall
But I'm way worse because he was cornball
I remember keeping him in my dungeon with a leather suit
And a orange ball in his mouth
I had some foreign bra's in his house
How did they get twisted and torn claws when in bout
Nine inches then I stuffed dorn draws in his couch
For now I let 'em suffer in the morn. all then its ouch
I have a devils haircut in my mind
That's why I be sucking blood and busting nuts in my rhymes, I'm horny
So don't ignore me if your semi-fine
Me and Gordy, Prozak love orgies and we in our prime and we
Can't hide the (horns)

Verse 2 - Prozak-
Schizophrenic thoughts spin around my mind sorta like rotissery
Spittin' this wicked ministry to the beat of this rebeck's symphony, with a sin for me
Separated by 6 degrees of greed for centuries
And hatred engulfs my sensories like hallow screams from penitentiaries
This perpetuus cycle of depression intention remains bottomless
Even my psychologist said suicide may be the only option out of this
And while the name prozak and insane seem to sustain synonyms
One half of me wants to engage in the fame while the other half subsides monogamously
A vigilantly that sends deadly packages through the mail
Confusing law enforcement agencies 'cause I write death threats in brail
With somewhat of a God complex sending the Arabs to the depths of hell
I warned you, you were for warned, now witness like horns unveiled
I'm taking you on a hell ride so grab those safety belts and fasten em
Through the screams of tortured souls and eternal flames crackling
Refusing to reap what you sow and wanna stop this all from happening
This madness will continue until all of Strange' goes platinum
Can't hide the (horns)
And I won't hide the (horns)
I live with the (horns)
So I die with the (horns)
If you fuck with the (horns)

Verse 3 - King Gordy-
I'm in the Desert sands of Bethlehem
Trying to get Jesus to get Mary in the manger,
And molest a lamb!
Don't jerk yourself off Jesus, use someone elses hands,
So where's those damn disciples,
He'd like to have some sex again!
I guess Young Peter's receiving,
'Cause Jesus fucked his ass.
Christ is an effin' fag,
He likes to dress in drag.
But hey I guess his Dad is just as mad,
God woulda never had a sissy for a son,
Bet he's regrettin' that!
But yet we still ain't accept the fact,
That he's fuckin' his mother,
And at the Last Supper, he confesses that.
He's an undercover, Male-Lover,
And oh yeah, Heaven's wack!
He don't want the Light,
Now I got Christ wearin' black!
See, I'm the Devil on his shoulder,
Yeah I'm that scary fat demon,
That'll turn all you hethens into scaredy cats.
King Gordy, the ANTI-Christ, God Killer (I am!)
Before and AFTER Christ, I'm called a sinner,
Muthafucker!

Cuzz I was up in the hotel all in the jiggamapie
I didn't lie!"
145,I Get It Now,2016,The Storm (2016),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Industry does not, feel you
I'm sick of this shit
Blind bitches wish
N9ne's wickedness away
Motherfuckin' killer B
There's about to become a distillery
The majority don't really feel a G
With the paint and a dark soliloquy
Music, they said killed the fee
Me, Krizz, and Makzilla free
So I'm gonna have to keep it real with me
Fuck them straight with agility
They callin' me crazy
Don't wanna play me
So I make the music that will target their babies
And open 'em up to wicked shit
They wanna know how hip is this
This never been no hipster shit
So the fakers see me and dis the 'fit
I ain't cool like the late great Biggie Smalls, the illest
So I went the route of a killer clown comin' to pillage a village
Steady tryin' to get 'em all to feel it
But I learned you can't please everybody
When my mother was livin' they used to say ""your son is scary Maudie""
I don't give a flyin', dyin'
Spy inside of al-Qaeda, they lyin'
When tryin' to diss Tech N9ne
And when they all shall buy us
I don't fit the part for main stream 'cause I'm rougher
Only time they wanna look like me is Halloween motherfucker
I realize I'm not inviting
You ain't with it
Sit it down
I'm a vicious
Wicked clown
And I'm livid when the critics give us frowns
Trippin' with this nigga's sound
Yup, I get it now
Get it, me and you, we are not the same
We unequal and the people is to blame, get it?
I get it now
I guess I got the wrong pants on
And I don't really make no dance songs, get it?
I get it now
Y'all can't tell I'm fuckin' myself up more and more on purpose?
I love scarin' the hell out of y'all, haha
Stick the masses, whack it off in the casket
Sound like they wrist broken like put the fuckin' lotion in the basket
How is he livin' lavish when he rap really fast and he mask it?
They don't get it when I gas it
They laugh at it, mad it ain't ratchet
They wanna wear clothes just like A$AP Rocky, like Yeezy and Drake
That's what they identify with, not with a nigga with the clown paint on his face
I get it that I'm wicked
When I spit it they be comin' to get 'em a ticket
Talk a lot of shit at the gate and they got to zip it
When I'm bustin', they open up to somethin' different and dig it
I get it, I never looked like the average black dude
Track shoes, gold teeth, and covered in tattoos
Yak, booze, reeking and chiefing the sack through
Speakin' about reaching them hardened hat screws
Jack move
Yes I've become a big boss
But I'll never be cool as Rick Ross
That's okay, N9ne's been rhyming
And now he's shining
Perfect timing
You ain't with it
Sit it down
I'm a vicious
Wicked clown
And I'm livid when the critics give us frowns
Trippin' with this nigga's sound
Yup, I get it now
Get it, me and you, we are not the same
We unequal and the people is to blame, get it?
I get it now
I guess I got the wrong pants on
And I don't really make no dance songs, get it?
I get it now
So what I've come to realize is I will never fit in
So it's my duty to make sure that I stand the fuck out
Meht etinu lliw eh esuac', meht sthgif reven eh yhw s'that, meht ekil gnihton s'eH
If this thing does not kill you
Grind back to back tracks
Find racks on racks
N9ne's stacking that all day"

The reason that I'm breathin'
Seeping heat it gets me cheese while I'm eatin' in Bad Season
Was deep in beef and was needin' some beats to release in evenings
Instead of me being up and bleedin' with thieves and heathens with keys and obstacles
Made it possible for the flow, go ta be profitable
Yo tech audible his inarguable product popped and was plausible
God is so good for givin' me music!
Liftin', gettin' me through when I was fixin' ta lose it
Dudes hit Big Scoob's shit 'n' reppin' the blue tip
Foo's skipped when Scoob (scritch?) we jumped in the two whip
Full clips for who stick the homie for true grip
My crew, thanks to music, we all living through it
Got me out of the ghetto
Got me mucho dinero
In Cozumel, Mexico shorts and Jordans and a sombrero
This gift, ain't given from a devil, so settle
Come and get this rebel music that's hot as a kettle, pendejo
Saved my life, paid my lights, made my wife, say ""Bye Bye""
Gave my night babes, I like prayed my mic
Would never fade, forever slayed, days I write
My chedda raise up better, faze way high hyped
My music's one reason I always get to lay my pipe
The reason Tech N9na can comfortably say ""Night, night""
Blessed me, with original flow, so Hey! Why bite?
I hear, I feel, I live, listen, and learn
I like
(I love music)
Yeah, I love (I love music)
For real (I love music)
And I need (I love music)
To feel (I love music)
Go and play it (I love music)
Yeah, know what I'm saying? (I love music)
My love (I love music)
Know what I'm saying?
Automatic when I do this
Manually, daily, monthly, annually
I get a step closer to being the coolest
Acoustic got me foolin', about to lose it
Ooh, shit
Jump in the grind, and my hom' Mean Mike produced it
That's music pahtna
I'm just a poet with incredible rhythm
Words arranged will let you know he has incredible in him
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but toot toot, ha ha
I laugh because it's easier than do ray mi fa so la
Ti do, we know he go SayWa on that C Note
And he can play a C Note with that B Note
I'm talkin' truth
And I got stories that I show you that it's walkin' proof
A thousand miles of it and I can show you what I'm walkin' through
Music ain't a hobby, it's an organ, of my body, that the creator provided back in January of '92
So don't you dare say that music skipped my generation
Your hatin' ain't nothin' but motivation for these compilations
Oob

Yeah, it feeds me (I love music)
I need (I love music)
You feel me? (I love music)
Know what I'm saying? (I love music)
Yeah, it's my thang (I love music)
Know what I'm saying? (I love music)
And I love it (I love music)
Yeah, go ahead!
Music is my life
The reason why I write
Like Edgar Allen Poe on the beat, like a parasite
You thought a parachute made my flow just fall out the sky
Then you fell apart into a body part no one would buy
Nobody tried my limits 'cause they're afraid of heights
They ambition, weak or gravity let 'em die
I let you live until a nigga compose a rhyme
Then it's like a Rhino in your ass every time
Time and time again I treat my pen like The Pen
Bars harder than Pelican Bay and I been
Servin' a life sentence since the day I was ten
Nine times outta ten you only ten songs deep before you leap
Into a pool of sharks then swim
That's an analogy on the way I do casualties
And I do this shit casually
Before the first end, I'll be in the Hall of Fame with my picture framed, friend
And if it wasn't for my music, I wouldn't be standing here!
If it wasn't for my music, you wouldn't have nothing to hear, yeah
And I love (I love music)
I need it to live (I love music)
It's almost a gift (I love music)
Yeah, and I love yeah (I love music)
This time I'ma be quiet (I love music) (Shh!)
And I love it (I love music)
Showing I love it (I love music)
Whoa!

147,I Love You but Fuck You,2008,Killer (2008),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Damn, my brand new Benz
Thinkin' bout my so called friends
And why should I make amends when they crossed the nina and sin
Again and again and again.
I love 'em dearly, but hear me, they burn severely
I'm weary to the point that I really don't want not one of them, none of them near me
Did trust you, but what's new for real
Yeah, I love you, but fuck you for real
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you, kinda strange how you came at me
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you, things will never be the same with me
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you, kinda strange how you came at me
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you, things will never be the same with me
Met you at a rock show, November no Octo
Took pictures then locked yo numbers and then got low
Called you up a lot though, found out that you not ho
Several trips to my show, shot me with your cross bow
We used to kick it in packs, whites and blacks
Triple stacks and fat sacks, we matched, we relaxed
To kiss but I never twist 'er, she wished for the better mister
I mixed the lady with my kid brother and miss, she became my sister
For a minute but then my lady started receivin' that snitch
By the nigga on tour, you wanna be the reason that split
You started believin that bitch in San Jose, you gripped what the damn ho say
You flipped like a man will stay, no trips, never sanjo pay
We dipped, used to play for you, even used to pray for you
Never dap 'cause you wanted to spit in my face, it was up up up and away for you
I hate this, I was real so why fake shit?
You lost her, so go fuck them bitches on myspaces
Every show was a different face, but these two were from a distant place
Followed my tour got a quick embrace, never woulda thought I had to give them space
Father and daughter, loved me to death, never cared that blood be the set
Just lovin' the Tech, shrugs in regret when I found out papa kinda had the husband effect
Everybody seen it, but I didn't believe it. Everybody got it but never did I receive it
His dream was for me to fuck Miss Thing
But she looked fifteen, baby girl was nineteen
But instead of givin' her dick I rather give her ice cream
Now I'm trippin' 'cause her pops just tried to auction her off
But it turns out he was knockin' her off. I had to stop and I cough
'Cause that daddy turned out to be the boyfriend
Guess he was gettin' him a little bit extra when he brought the toys in
Ya lied to me, did it fuck wit the Nina, sure it did
Y'all made me question what ya motive is
Don't cry Ally, but my temper was flared and scared also
To see ya guess I'll see ya in the crowd like Where's Waldo
I love you 'cause you married me when I needed therapy
Let me move in with you be my wife, you wasn't scared of me
But fuck you because you say, if you don't get a job today
Better kick rock wasn't hard to say when you knew I rap my heart away
I love you 'cause you sexy, love you 'cause you beautiful
Love you 'cause way back in the day, you thought that I was suitable
But Fuck You, you treated me, stupid and conceitedly
I wasn't very smart, but a genius you wanted me to be
I love you 'cause you strong, I love you 'cause your real
Because you forgave me when I cheated and popped them pills
But fuck you for bringin' up shit that happened years ago
Chances of us gettin' back, it's gonna take a miracle
You live in the past, I'm givin' the gas and cash
How many niggas do that without you givin' the ass?
And I ask you what other nigga, would step up with the love to give her
G's in the house for you and the kids and even for your brother nigga
Enjoy the dough you get, 'cause I don't owe you shit
You was unhappy wit me, so you split
You need to show me some love, ma, and I don't mean that I wanna fuck you
Just acknowledge me takin' care of you because I'll, I...
(Tech N9ne)
Verse One, I ain't never spoke nothin' but highly about you
But you gonna believe a bitch you never met, that's hardcore shit baby
Verse Two, I mean, y'all lied to a nigga
I mean, that was foul shit you did, man
I don't know what the fuck your motive was
But it hurt me real bad 'cause I trusted you motherfuckers
Verse Three. I Know I fucked our marriage up
But you can't live in the past
You either gotta let that shit go, or let me go"

How deceptive can the clown be?
Enough to leave the frowns upon the face of those who foul me
So much evil in my mindstate

But can not tame the wicked primate
Who preaches sinful thoughts and lead the listeners on blind faith
I didn't mean to hurt a soul here
But my inner demon has no fear
Of making choices that'll make you po' tears
Black transparent flies show me that the soul near
I see 'em then they disappear quickly
Could this be some other shadows signaling the sickly?
Forgive me
Good people, I gotta let them know before they pick me

I learned my vices, they divide niggas
Had a chance to say I'm sorry and then he died

So hurt that I couldn't stand

And touching my loved ones dissolving their helping hands

Matchin' from head to toe dippin' with a mean strut
Throwin' and blowin' green stuff
Hella creamed up with the bling cuff
Ain't no wicked we can kick it if you blue or beamed up
If you see me step off in the clubber with some pros
With about six of 'em cut no longer waitin' to be chosen
If you hear me tell my homies anything goes
With these chickens dippin' to Davy's right when the clubber close
If you see me on the grind gettin' mine
If you bust in a room and find me hittin' yours from behind
If you hear me bustin' rhymes, rippin' each and every time
If I got it at capacity and you still got a line
If I'm rollin' on dubs, if it's K-town bud
If they showin' me love with a red rug at the club
If you see them haters givin' me mugs
Ladies givin' me hugs
Know it ain't no rocket science it's because

She want a playa not thugs on dubs
We be rollin' them 22's and 3's
Poppin' ludes and V's
I'm in hot pursuit of a prostitute
Calico knock boots gots lots to shoot
And I'm pullin' out the latex
And givin' it to who's next
I'm pullin', pull a brunette
With unforgettable sex

(Listen closely, this is somethin' you might not know)
Never ever tell your love or else she'll get your love
Move in groups, no one on one when you hit the club
And you should know this if you call yourself a wicked thug
If you creep to the movies, throw away your ticket stub
If you sexin', learn this lesson when you wash off
Just use hot water, don't put no soap on your washcloth
That way when you get home
No questions, you won't leave her bent
Don't be a dope and use the soap cause it will leave a scent
Don't tell a number 2 that she's your one and only
'Cause if she knows we're easy to go her own way
If you takin' chickens to your secret home, hey
Always go the back way confuse 'em just take the long way
To all my ladies if you playin' throw your hands up
To all my fellas if you playin' throw your grands up

Listen
I know I'm always gone
And I ain't never home
And plus you barely ever hear me on the telephone
Just tryin' to sell a song
Till my bright angel is known, and my hell is showin'
But if I rest it's just like I'm my mail is thrown
All away all the day all they say call the way
A loved one calls to say all's at bay hog it stay for a holiday
But I'm far away, gotta pay, lotta K
For my daughter's way son and mommas they sobbin' and its problems when I'm away
But I gotta go get it
A lotta dough in it
A hundred percent I'm in it to fly real with it
Tecca N9na be rakin' it up when I go spit it
But it get to me when the family cry don't shit it
Becomes hella hurtful
Yo
Feel like I'm running around in circles
If I could I would I would stop but I might go berserko
But if I could, I would be good
I would be there for you just like I should
You wouldn't cry when I say goodbye
For the reasons, do not tell me why
But if I could, I would be good
I wouldn't leave you, you'd think that I would
It feels like I die a little inside,
Know that I hurt you when I say goodbye
Could have could (4x)
(Yeah)
(Would that I could)

Check it
I know your heart is skippin',
'Cause I'm on a mission
Your eyes and schnauze are drippin',
Cause your dog is missin'
And you has brought him wishin' he wasn't a fricken politician
You want his kissin' and you hope and pray that God is listenin'
You wanna frolic with him,
But he gotta get them, dollars give them all of his grim, pile of scripts, and they all assist him
Now he's balla big and tall ambition you're fallin' friction cause you miss your body's twitchin' throbbin' from his rod incisions
So you started fishin',
Websites and call and bitchin'
Thinkin' some broad is nibblin' on his dick and y'all is driftin'
But he just say nah to chickens, all of this when cause is given
If I could I would dissolve suspicion
Just trust me,
Please just trust me
I'm doing all of this music,
So we can go all over the world
I swear to God,
I'ma take you all over the world baby
We're gonna go,
To Hawaii,
We're gonna stay for months
You always knew I wanted to go to Hawaii
And we're gonna go all over the world baby Just give me time,
I gotta get this right
Doing up some world tours, I swear to God we're gonna go
All over the world, we're gonna take road trips
We're gonna go,
To Japan, we're gonna go,

Wishes I could put the nine on his tongue

Being my beezy ain't easy, she won't see me a lot

Why do I have to feel like I'm begging you-
To be with me, puttin' me through this hell when I'm showin' you what Heaven do?
After all of these years, I never knew
You would back off and slack off when I had to move and stop your monthly revenue
Only wanted to love you but money seemed to be bigger
That's worse than us having sex, and you white, and calling me ""nigger""
It's over baby, hope you get this message that I deliver
It never was about loving, it was what I could give her
It's crazy, crazy, (crazy)
I didn't hear from you in a year and found out you had somebody else's baby
No more me and you girl, I had to go
Hit the do', now the only time you see me is at my show

Ask me what I wanna be when I grow up
I ain't jus gonna blow up
I'm a star I got astronomers tryina get a close up
Telescopes and cameras
Rappers wanna use blammers
But I'm gleamin from the planets homie
Mine is called kansas city
The cloud in my pocket gotta rain on em
Such a star I saw heavens walls and wrote my name on em
So comfortable at the top I hopped on a plane and claimed everest
You might as well say the boy is himalayan
I rent my rooms on the moon mr smith is comin' soon
The angels feedin me cereal with a silver spoon
My hair line is craig smith airlines
The ride from kansas city to LA is as long as a fan line
I'm high as '08 gas prices
My votes are twice as high as obamas & I ain't gotta ask nice
I'm high as techs tour bus
The light skinned one so if you're lookin' for me dog look up and try to find the sun
I'm in the air
High in the air

1/3 in extinction hit which left the lime light ajar
You want your scripts to fly
Not in my solar system 'cause I dismiss 'em like they wish to die
Mack mother nature and I rip the why
Civillian ladies love me so bro excuse her while she kiss the sky
Call me masta more exalted then a priest or pastor
Blasphemy have me blast facts fast with magma
In the air like dancer and dasher
High in the sky up above mountains off in Alaska
Higher then a million heroin hits that fit to last ya
Super celestial when everyone stuck off in the pasture
The whack I will cast ya down below those who get caught up in my rapture

Did everything within my power not to kill her

What about the Strange Music symbol being a snake and bat, you know, some people say the ""s"" and the ""m"" stands for, Sado-masochism, an, an, the barcode cross that means the evil is god, how do you explain that.

Krizz: I mean it just means Nutthowze, its...
Whitlock: How do those numbers means Nutthowze? Explain to me...
Krizz: You gotta look on the phone, N-N-U-T-T-H-O-W-Z-E, it just means Nuthouse and I think people try to make this thing into more than it is man.
Whitlock: Those numbers if you add 'em up, six, plus six, plus eight, plus eight, plus eight- if you add 'em up they equal sixty-seven, an an, you know Tech is always saying hes all sixes and sevens,
Krizz: Yeah...
Whitlock: You know some people say he's trying to say six is evil, seven is godly, you know, angelic, the name of his album originally, saying that's good, and bad, and he might've been saying, evil, is god the whole time, are you missin' this?
Krizz: This just Tech provokin' y'all, man, and y'all fall for it.
Whitlock: Ok. You're music is really startin to spread, all across the world.

And I was noticing she was so sadistic
Wanted the Nina to bite on her nipples and twist it
Sucking me off until she lost all of her lipstick
You know how it is when you X-ing on like 7 of em'
Wit a stick of Sherm and Adderall, nigga had to love em'
'Cause they get you lifted and thinkin' you unstoppable
But what I'm bout to tell you is so fuckin' impossible
I started giving the bitch my dick
She loving the way my jimmy be jabbin it
Wanted me to cut her up, I said never
She said imagine it with the tip of her butcher knife
I think I took her life
This crazy hooker like pain, then I put her right
Fuckin' high, and it's insane how she look at life
She wish a nigga had fangs and he took a bite
I'm beating it up wit an aim what the pussy like
The pussy like to be banged like it took a fight
Then she asked me to smack her
Then she asked me to choke her
So I choked her
As a nigga got closer to the nut I choked her
Even harder as I when I rose up out the Chocha
She wasn't breathing, A horrible evening
Couldn't get her to breath, I really tried ta
Did all I could of but it wasn't all to the deal
So I had to call the ambulance over to come revive her
It was an accident

Shit I was only 16, just showing off
Never woulda imagined the gun going off
I was just trying to show these niggaz that I wasn't soft
Stayed at 52nd street so that's what all these niggaz thought
'Cause they was from hilltop, where niggaz pill pop
So I'm pulling up to the chill spot
Wit the steel cocked
Still not sure what I was thinking
And back then I wasn't even drinking
So I'm leaving Lincoln High School off Woodland
Headed to the hood to hang out wit all the hoodlums
Couldn't wait to show him what I was packing
Knock on the door, he answered like ""Whuuss Crackin""
I said ""Shit, just chillin', just me and my bitch""
""By my bitch, I mean that 450 sittin' on my hip""
""Wanna see""? He said ""yeah let me see""
I pulled it out and gave it a quick squeeze
I didn't know it didn't have no safety
Now this man is hit in his chest and he can't breath
Devil on my shoulder whispering ""Leave nigga, Leave""
But I swear...
It was an accident

Shock when the pain quits
Pac would've banged this
Instantaneous when I aim at the miscellaneous
Ask me ask ask why why I'm the strangest
Because...
Nobody ever wanted me rapping
But I knew within me I could make it happen
Flipping hella different to get it cracking
Never biting nothing I was never jacking
Millimeter spitting ripping up a show
Got the people trippin' everywhere we go
And now we getting you to know that misery is coming
We were summoned now the haters running when we gunning
Why yo you don't know
That I'm 'bout to blow K-C-M-O
Better bang this
People make their jokes and say we're off to see the wizard
Well me and Dorothy and Toto's on your ass when you visit
It's alive (aw hell)
It's alive (Dod Gwamn)
It's alive (odd male)
It's alive (I am)
Been in the dark a minute but now I made it through it
This Kansas City I'ma show you how we do it
We say walla
Milli dollar
Then break a lot a jaw (2x)
Watch this rock
Who would bust like my style it's ruffcut and it's
True hood stuff bright hot wild mystic plus mannish
Alien nation invasion
Black white and even Asian
Is gazing at the raised in misery faze ravin'
For the crazed haven
Six six triple eight forty-six ninety-nine three
We back
Sick with nickel plates whorry chicks mighty mine be
We pack
Just when you're knowing where I'm gonna be I vanish
Step into my brain got it so dark that you can't see God dammit
Your flows come in your flows go out
My flows eternally coming out your mouth
Your makers in
Some haters doubt
And yes it's pitiful
Not even my pinnacle
Better know when I bust
I can do it everyday with a mind full of lust
If you really must
Get with a N9NE millimeter gun then trust
You'll get left the in the dust
Everybody better move when I groove I'ma hit 'em with a bus
Anybody with a bigger mouth up in here better hush
We say walla
Milli dollar
Then break a lot a jaw (x2)
Kansas City City City
That's where I really wanna be
Grime and gritty gritty gritty
Back up when I throw that V
Up in the air air air
That's five seven R D V
And you know nare nare nare
That'll represent like me
Yo we did it in Kansas City yo we did it
Like Biggie say
Much love my left mind said Tech N9NE is iggy J
You can find me off in Kansas City on Saturday at Maniax
Or at the Motel 6 laying up with two chicks the Lenny and Squiggy way
Or Jack
Tripper I'm TECH the rap
Ripper on Cognac
Liquor I'm TECH the gat
Clicker I'm up on that
Thicker than water track a whipper-snap
Who's trying to bring Tony Kannedy Del Shawn and Chipper back
Signing off
Rhyming off
The wall constantly
Timing off
Never that
Clever raps the comp can't be
Creeping seeping through crevices hella beefing
Thinking they can stop the heart of Kansas City
But the heart of Kansas City is beating
We say walla
Milli dollar
Then break a lot of jaw (x4)"

Errybody jus (throw your hands up what)
All the ladies jus (throw your legs up what)
All the fellas just (throw your cups us what)
And toast to the homeboys that soften your girls guts what
Say man she said she broke up with you last week
Now you trippin' 'cause your chicken went out and passed cheeks
And got a fast leak from Tecca Nina Katrina
Now's she right up in mi cocino while your ass sleeps
How'd I take her from you? oh its ??
It's because your girly girly know I earn somethin'
Now I got them legs over my shoulders
Holdin' my soldier swollen I can't hold my composure
And when I come to town, your woman come around
And plenny fun is found when I give her some of the clown
The Kansas City style got her yellin' ""jus gimme now""
You don't wanna do the sound 'cause I'm doin' bout 20 rounds
If your girls at a Tech show (it's what you thinkin')
Feel like she let go (it's what you thinkin')
You never get no (x3) (it's what you thinkin')
She know you barely make it, we got crazy cash
On the movie set me and my homie Baby Bash
Got your girl waitin to get her world shakin
At the Grand American givin' your girl spankins
'Cause she's a bad gal she said she need a release
So she greated with beats now she's no longer sad now
I'm with your wifey
'Cause she say I make her feel wanted and by the way she never met nobody like me
At the Graft and laugh makin' her stare at things
Cutty Cal Grese Chris ??
Got your hottie naughty when she drinkin' them Cara B's
At Kidd Rocks and I'm off in a booth with Tara Read
Tecca Nina is not a coward, I'll jump in the shower
And bumpity bumb that rock girl if you doubt her
Ask freaky Adina Howard about her
She know we scorpios lovin' to hit it for hours
If your girls at a Tech show (it's what you thinkin')
Feel like she let go (it's what you thinkin')
You never get no (x3) (it's what you thinkin')
I see you mad at me, but my nads happy
'Cause you loosin and now you wanna take a stab at me
She hangin' wit me 'cause you foul nigga
And I'm at the 4 seasons takin' her to eat Tao nigga
That's T.A.O when I see a hoe
She's hooked when I let the instant replay go
She's bear now everyone's there throwin' wood at it
Man this musics so unfare if you good at it
Come with us wemon it's so fun with us under the sun with us
From dawn till dusk imma give her the love that make her wanna say hummdawala
Praisin this craziness in Vegas when I get up on the stage it's outragous
Mandaly Bay with the ?? everybody gets laid to this
I appologize if your heart broken
Keep a spark smokin' once the Ninna starts scopin
She'll lie to you and wont blink
When it come to Tecca Ninna bein wit your lady don't think

Look at these keys, look at my ride, I'ma tycoon
From the land of the gangsters and pimps and hustlers
Where a hundred will get you three hundred dollars worth of poppers
Every time I look around

Wanna smile in my face and take my place hate

During his jail polls
And knocked him out of his shell toes
When I walk into the spot them suckas sucking on them sickles
Hate to see me shining get to tripping when they off they ripple
I, get these rappers dripping jelly to the third degree
Most of them in my city never know me but yet they heard of me
At the BET awards chilling with the Federation
Never forget the woman at the door giving
Away the shoes didn't really want me to have 'em
Man I had a ticket I had to grab 'em
Come to find out I was in a rhyme 'bout a couple years ago
Here's the blow 'cause I rake up dough
She was one of the women I left behind up at the wake up show
Congratulate me 'cause I'm a go getta

Wanna live in my world you have to have a Tech tat
Preferably the number N9ne and you gotta get it where the back of yo neck's at
Gotta let me know that you rep that, plus get you out of a death trap
You need it for living 'cause I'm the king and I'm giving you the permission to get with a no stress pack
That was ordos at chlorum cause the old world orders post mortem disfailure inhaling cell and delta
Watched it swell and swelter, till there was no male in shelter,
Yes I'm the one that provided ya shell in Hell and held ya
When your politicians were welchers
So I built this structure just to help ya
So the communists can come and quell ya
They call me the King of Darkness, when I offer you no pain
Why would they label me heartless, when your love is my cocaine
And your soul is my rogaine, I have a thirst to know your brain
When you enter my domain gotta take this number for your name
But you don't have to drink cyanide, I'm gonna be right by ya side
If we gotta take that riot ride, on the enemy and defy your side
Fight for the place we're building, for the reproduction of more children
Trying to get that number back around 6 billion, I'm gonna rule until then
Founded this colony like a pilgrim, anybody try to penetrate this section or threaten we KILL THEM.

Xes lliw eb yrotadnam yliad ylthgin.
This, women need to be living by it
Stay fit 'n' way driven paste it and dye it
I am the king killer captain crazed frigging pilot
Giving you these khaki pants and white shirt, that's what you wear on my Earth
Eliminating your eye thirst to have any kind of desires
To envy material or admire, my way will extract any type of divider
I'm offering this wider understanding of life and tiredly blissfully 'vading friction and fire, cha.
The number N9ne will get you food, even get you tools
To build anything your family choose, but within my rules
All white shoes with red strings for all my crews
That lets me know you Tech's people listening inside my pews
All your dreams and aspirations,
This is the affirmation that you can reach 'em and my world is not a disaster waiting
The ruses and lacerations no chooses of aggravation
I'm just tryna rehab a nation from exasperation
It's not an exaggeration, I'm something more than your blood and gore
On a level higher than devils or that of Satan.
What if?
K. O. D. O. K. O. D. O.
What if, he is, what he says he is?
The King Of Darkness!

(Repeat)
When I did 'Anghellic' I was good and bad, straight confused
Then an angel turned to Devil Boy when the Reparation blew
Them demons had 'Absolute Power' when I drug abused
So the angels searched through the 'Vintage Tech' what they found was the love was through
Then an accident would happen that made life unnecessary
So now receiving God, the angel was 'Everready'
But the 'Melancholy' strikes, the eleven angels mommy's life
So the 'Mizery' sat in the angels now becoming ice
As mom got ill and iller, when it hurts her he can feel her
To the strain of the pain made of bane there's no more angels straight up KILLER!
My apologies, it's not very God of me, to go crazy and try to teach the whole world 'Sickology'
I was then split in two, back to the beginning view
Angel demon ccause the killer showed me death was overdue
But I gotta live for my kids, all the evil stuff I did
Taught me to teach you you can love them no matter how much sluts you did
Or done, you met my demon back when I had that grudge
But I gotta let you know most of my spirit comes from up above
I'm mostly angel, and you know sometimes we fall
Living under God and I hope he's listening when I say I love you all!"

And they do it all night and day long but when they see me that frowned up hatin' face gone
Ain't no rah uh reason ya fronted ya should've just kept it one hunit learn how to make ya face stay stone
Why you comin' at me like that, is it 'cause I came up you mad, cause ya see me with all this cash (Keep it one hunit)
Homie it ain't no changin me, yeah I'm still the same OG and on my momma I'm always be (Keep it one hunit)

Verse 2: I'm a playa, ma'fuck haters, and this a thin line (shit) but thas what separates us. If they smart, they are the segregaters, team of Kansas city chiefs, wit a ma'fuckin' Raider. That's a problem in the makin', a problem in the matrix, people that's unplugged (man) would probably be the safest. So understand I hope this hood shit sacred, hand on the bible I shoot it out to satin, if he ever did say shit, I really would be finer, ya you heard me nigga, anytime 'cause, still serving nickels, step ya grind up, I knew the game was dirty b'fore I signed up, ya this rap shit is circus full of clowns and, otha weirdos acting silly for the croud, then they think we all the same till my pistols get to plowin, so a hunit ain't enough, gotta keep it one thousand.
Verse 3: Tech N9ne
It sounds like they wanna claim KC king
They can't advance in this game 'cause they weakling
When in the trap making penis that can't see things
Like me at marina grog and galey mane feasting
Party of 70 at the (fogo da'chao)
You niggas small time, me and travis mogulin' now
Holding us down almost everybody know what it sounds of
Tecca nina despite the hate you be throwing around
From now on they will not talk nay talk
And they family won't have to walk cross grave moss
I'm the king it because I mob boss pay cost
I pro ball on 'em they rock chalk Jayhawk
So bow down cause the king gets hyphy
If you slight me ain't no stopping the nina the almighty
Don't you see the snake and bat shining brightly
Keep it one hunit if your rappers don't really like me, fight me!

Wake up show with King Tech and Sway, Yukmouth, Thicker Than Water,
Gang Related, Eminem, Roger Trout, MC Ren, nigga Spice One and Nem.
Hit'em with a venom sit'em down kill'em when I spit,
When I get a bit of scrilla Tech is giving niggas shit,
Love who love us but the playa hatin' niggas better split
It'll never be another Teccanina when I quit
You better neal when you hear a nigga that's real I feel
18 when I bust from the grill because (if you keep it young) your
Song is always sung so street life taught me to keep'em sprung

You don't wanna meet
I'm the worst, a lot of women see the demon in me
Still they want a piece
They want me chronally
A lot of them really searchin for the seman in me
I let 'em know at the front of a lust demon that wanna be bust kitty, be rubbin, I love many
They trust me with the cunt, I thrust plenty, n jump in the next city, they wanted me, just kidding
But I can never tell a lie, if you looked into my eyes, you can see that I'm a -
Angel
Demon
Lookin' for the love in every thigh, makin' you wanna cry, spirit'll be
Strangled
Screamin
That, I'm a serial killer, when it come to heart break
Hate 'n' the fury ya better cynic in the smarts makin'
Everything wrong, everythings gone, so why do you say you will for ever ding dong
That just will make ya much meana
That's sum mistake ta love Ninna
It sucks ta hate the one thing that makes ya come clean, then breaks 'n' just leave ya
I'm just a fucked up individual
I love lust, n crushin ya for an intervul
Plus bust a guts up in a centerfold
Eating the meeting up like it's a dinner roll
Ya should'a kept away like I told ya
How can ya press to stay when I'm rove'a
I think it's safe ta say that my fate's ta lay n I'mma waste away when I'm olda
So just step 'n' gimmie the cold shoulda
'Cause I'm a mess, the Ninnas the most vulga
N I'm a threat, ya never get no close'a
My kiss is killing you, wake up 'n' its ov'a
Why can't you see me, for the animal I am?!
I warned you!
Exposed my beast inside, NEXT IF you are willing to (willing to, willing to, willing to)
You took my invitation in. They all told ya never to take me in
Why can't you wake up 'n' see that I am killing you?! (killing you, killing you, killing you)
I never knew why I had to be so cold
Inside'a me so froze, its gatta be no soul
Because whenever the lady want me in oath mode,
I put on my ghost clothes, n get on a close road
I'm tryin' ta tell you that I'm sick in the insephalon
I thought I could doit, but I guess I'm weak, n never bond
As long as I'm chasin the gold like a leprachaun
My heart'll be covered in cold ice intephalon
I'm sick wit'it
I'm brick wit'it
N9ne twist-ed it
Ten times outta ten if you lookin' for what it stems,
I can guarantee that you gonn' find a bitch did it
But I'm takin' it back, I won't blame it on you
'Cause I be the one that be gamin on you
Famous, n heanous, the pain in you, 'cause I'm blatently playin' 'n' laying the crew
I ain't proud'a whut I turned into
All my fire keeps burning through, burning you
Up in the inside, I'm knowin' the heat is concerning you
I don't know what's gonna become of me
All I can say is don't anyone love me
Because I'm a monster, I'm sick n I want'cha
But'chu better back up 'n' when I COME SHOVE ME
But then again I really really need you
I want up inside'a you, I wanna bleed you
Get the last drop then I'mma leave you

174,Klusterfuk,2012,Klusterfuk EP (2012),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"I was born in November, 8th day 1971st y'all
9 oclock in the morning, a Christian girl in Kansas City gave birth y'all
She taught the kid how to love and give all praises to our maker till the earth fall
Then mama married a Muslim when I was 12 and that transition was the worst y'all
I converted to Islam but every once in awhile I read a Bible verse y'all
How am I to refrain from eatin pork and havin' Christmas when I thirst all
All of this it was blended many religions plenty women got my shirt y'all
At home no longer attended when I was 17 I bounced like a nerf ball
(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
Yeah, spit it big quick
My day, I say, pie matrick, don't get a bitch hit (questionable)
I'm mastering it-nit, I'm flyin around with equipment
Really big time and now I'm not fittin this bitch
I'm ridin' around and I'm grittin it
To the people the people that want the evil I'm givin' you, that and a couple others a KLUS-TER-FUK
Of a brother which you discover to KRUSH-MUCKS-UP
In the gutter 'cause I'm a thug and they TOUGH-JUST-STRUCK
On you MUHFUCKAS I'll be the BLOOD BROTHA givin' you love from the slug if you bug on a nigga
TUG on a trigger no HUGS I'm a kiss her with grunges and plug her with drugs when I give her
Dick
Fatherly, when I spit on these kiddies don't bother me
In the brown and red dickies, Mahogany
Red all over me like I hit an artery
Fuck all of these, hypocrites, lick a dick, Just swallow me
If you follow me and wanted to abolish me
When I'm honestly, a straight oddity
I'm just twisted, non-fictitious, on this wicked, shit spit it big quick
Ready whenever machete will sever the head or be dead up in the lake or in the metal and big thick bricks
Pucker up, suck this nutter butter gutter slut
If you wonder what is uttered this is KLUSTERFUK
Ever seen a nigga with hella followers and they love a nigga so much he be wantin to tell them to kill
HA HA HA HA HA, and they will
So ya better watch that no this ain't a shock tactic got that bit down to the grill
Heheheheheheheeeeh, way real
I got the shit that get the crowd jumpin'
My shit a lotta thumpin silly just like a DRUNKEN MONKEY
Nigga we PUNKIN FLUNKIES
Killa we KRUNK N FUNKY
Uh... PUMPING CHUNKY
Uh... BOOTY B!TCHES IN THE BUNK WITH A DONKEY EH!
Crazy, I might be way in my psyche laid as a bright p.a
Playin', they wanna fight me, they don't really like me, they gonna not replay
Yeah I'm good and a little bit of evil
Inside of me, they about equal
Call it a bust, when I'm all in a rut
I'm a Klusterfuk, nigga y'all are just
Fecal
Growin' up low enough, musta sucked
People
Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk
Fecal
Growin' up low enough, musta sucked
People
Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk
Talk about growin' up f-cked up, I grew up with a mentally ill mother, so it's no wonder that I'm slightly askew
Her fanatical religious views had me sittin' in pews 8 days a week, and because of that me and God didn't speak for a while
Now I crack a smile when asked my religious preference
I utter a Tech N9ne reference replyin, I'm a KLUSTERFUK
I mixed up all the stuff religion that had to offer, boiled it in my cauldron till the bullshit burned off and
All that was left was love, I can't say I always rise above the trivial shit in my life 'cause I don't
Sometimes my ego won't allow me to walk away, if you know what I'm saying
I've done a lot of drugs, shit, I've done a lot of thugs, but in the end
As long as I'm aligned with love, I know I'm livin' righteous
By a landslide my energy
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy, (Growin' up low enough, musta sucked)
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically, (Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk)
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy, (Growin' up low enough, musta sucked)
Will kill a man why try mimic me

Aw shit, Aw fuck
Me, Kali and Ces we go to get bucks
On the path but didn't think we'd get stuck
By some crass lads that's 'bout to get tough
And they play not, temperatures stay hot
And don't nobody be relaxin' when on they block
Like it a yay spot, never let that pay stop
Unless you wanna be trippin' with Kutty and Jay Rock
(Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun)
Bad Flames, Feature Presentation, Raw and UnKutt
All of 'em undeniable classics like who they come from
Most talked about on the internet
Nigga I been a vet
Eleven years strong, still holdin' on
And I ain't finished yet
Red headed-est step child
It's a plague spread to accept how it is
Wanna see me fall get me out the loot
When all I've done is respect how it is
Now I gotta turn into a nigga you once knew
No mo' papers off
Probation I'm a cold case
He gon' sho hate it
When I throw a bomb like Troy Aikman
To do damage you walk in a bunch huh?
When you niggas are really the punks huh?
In the hearts of men, I'm seeing cowards
Where you niggas is at when the funk come?
Smoke a blunt to that
When the funk ensues you resort to rap
Said you was all in, 2 on the 10 you must distort the facts
So I pledge allegiance to only me I only breathe
Eat to shit, the chrome's in me [probably wrong]
The only misconstrued message in the song you see
Is it's not arrogance, this is what it's grown to be
(Hook: Krizz Kaliko)
See you can tell be the way that I use my wealth I'm cocky
This the man right chyea as to y'all out south I'm cocky
And if you ain't figured out what we talkin' about
I'm the one they all talkin' about
And if they hatin' me that only mean my name in they mouth I'm cocky
(Verse 2: Jay Rock)
Pull up to the spot, watch the girls all pause
Like a dirty ass dog house, drawers gon' fall
Bitches get wet when they see that candy paint
Soak yo dick through them boxers 'cause you got bank
Shout out to them shock collars (shot callers?), niggas got rank
Death to you snitches seen a light Drake
I'm all the way silent, I will never break
Pillow talking to them hoes, you all the way gay
The problem is niggas never know they place
Just know your role, play your part and you'll be straight
But niggas crooked like D-Bo eye
And could never ever see why we so fly
You either gotta go home or go hard
Keep a bad bitch with a good job and good jaw
Black strap on me, yeah you can tell when I walk
Pitbull of the leash if you flinch I'm a bark
(Hook: Krizz Kaliko)
(Verse 3: Tech N9ne)
You thought we through
Stop the bull talk
We rule papi
Smooth
Knock these fools off me
Boo sloppy
How I have they bitches bukakke
Move awfully cool hotty
Slob these jewels softly
Who's naughty?
Shock exudes bossy
Dude's cocky
Soowoo got me blue blocky
When I do shop
At the woowop
I bought the boo jockey
My Gucc watch
Perfuse rocks
And I be loose of the Caribou Lou
Mami your poonani
Saw me and got tsunami

They say the greatest
Paraded my lastest
Pages I created
And the news shot me
That's why I'm hated
You faggots is weak and dated
When I spray this place and do away
With all this fakin then erase it who'd stop me?
It is evident, that you wonder why and where her cheddar went
That look on your face I'm seeing I'd rather get
When your boo prop me

They get nothing but in the ground when they blown out
Oh wow, tell me how he got the stubborn, he tough and
He was young with a grown mouth
Zoned out cause my mother is gone, how
Simply would he send me with the alone route
Going out, to the studio hitting the Don Julio
My duty go if I'm moody yo, get up and get the song out
My angel fades, then came more rage
And even though Strange still pays,
Something inside of me saying it ain't yo days
My religion, walking away
My prediction, lost in the gray
I'm thinkin' the holy spirit don't really wanna hear it
So people who givin' me evil, they all finna pay
Anybody really want it, I'mma get dirty when a demon is my opponent
Feeling froggy any moment,
Know you will never be the owner because I'm on it
Losing mama, really did it, demons really gonna get it
I'm looking for the light, I'm asking you
Open and losing all of my inner good and the hope with it

Here go the fear though, getting the zilla
And my killas in the villa to make a racket in your ear go (BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM)
That is severe mode, bodies I'm not even with the jolly
My tears go down-my-face, yeah
But I'm switching the gears, yo
Got on the plane to Colorado, I go to hit the Summer Jam, then momma tomorrow
I'm thinking the Lord will give me time while I'm in 'Vado
To say I love her before the Bible go hollow
(Gone-gone-gone-gone)
My show was sorrow, needed a little bit of mo' time to borrow
(My-time's- up)
Man, steady talking to God, so I don't - get it
Thought I was special enough for God to be with it
By giving me another day with my mother, but I missed it
But rocking with Denver said in her name, I'ma rip this
(Done-done-done-done)
This ain't no way to be, hella jaded, see, but I'm created
My mother left me, but her death ain't okay with me
Still I'm praying for her spirit to stay with me

Tears are so serious (Still I am seeking)
Come, Holy Spirit
Stay with me always

I really need to get up outta this hole (man)
I'm really really sinking deep down in this hole
And I need to get out of this shit
I'm serious
I really wanna go into the light man
I, I know you all love me to be sad and shit, but
This gotta be my last sad song dude, I mean
I gotta get out of this shit before I lose myself in it
Don't you pity me no no just pray for me
That this will be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you'll stand here with me
And this will be the last sad song I have to sing
Eh
You all know my mothers sickness
You all know I'm breakin down
You all know in my cirlce the devils steady makin' rounds
You all know I'm missing my children because I'm shakin towns
And you all love my music and how sad I can make it sound
I'm in the darkness so low I'm under the carpet
Whom ever wants me to park it you motherfuckers is heartless
They want me stuck with hardships want an unhappy atrist
But I'm gonna break apart of this K.O.D shit regardless
Of who's mad a lot of my shit is too sad
Like the death of Micheal Jackson
Motherfucker who's bad
To jump right up out of myself
This shits a fight on my health
But darkness is selling
But I really wanna put y'all some light on the shelf
Will you still be
Able to feel me
Even if I'm not talkin' about trying to kill me
The king of darkness can no long conceal me
This could be my last sad song
Hopin it will be
Don't you pity me no no just pray for me
That this will be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you'll stand here with me
And this will be the last sad song I have to sing
Yeah
I want some carbiou lou
I wanna see areolas, chicks on my shoulders instead of boo hoo
Like I said I'm to through
With me spreadin blues fuel
All I wanna hear is about people say tech go ahead and do you
You all love my pain and I was glad to give it
But most the people who loved never really had to live it
Now they mad and live it
I don't want no sad visit
My music thinkin' about you lose it
So they bash and diss it
Before they even hear what I have got coming this year
I'm gonna be that lit spear
Let's get some of this shit clear
I ain't switchin to mainstream only
What is happening is you watchin the mainstream go me
So watch me bloom out of this black cocoon
'Cause if I go back into gloom I'm just askin for doom
Man I'm just rappin' about whom
To keep them from attacking my tomb
I don't wanna be Melancholy until they put my ass in a tomb
Don't you pity me no no just pray for me
That this will be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you'll stand here with me
And this will be the last sad song I have to sing
Listen
Only time can dictake if I'll get straight
But I'm reachin' for the light as of this date
I love K.O.D but I think I made a mistake
By letting negative energy in me now I'm misplaced
I lost somethin' along the way
My momma taught me bad things are wrong to say
Still I conjuered up a album of songs to play
For the dark and alot of my loved ones are gone today
Damn
I met a crossroad
I'm trying to go into the light like Carra Lam
There I stand still a lost soul
On this subject I wanna talk low
I'm ready to dangle this darkness at the top of the catacombs and toss those
But will you still be with me
Or just kill me quickly
Away with the darkness but I promise the flow will still be siccley
I am the king and I always have the throne
But I hope and pray for the bright of day hope this my last sad song
Don't you pity me no no just pray for me
That this will be the last sad song I have to sing
And only time will tell if you'll stand here with me
And this will be the last sad song I have to sing
(Mixed With Last Hook)
It's time to do something else
Cause this shits fucking me up
Talking about mediline really it's fucking me up man
It's affected everyone around me man
I'm tryin' to aaa
I gotta get out

Fuck this shit lets go party nigga"
178,Last Words,2008,Killer (2008),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(Dr. Frazier)
I know you dislike coming here
But what these sessions are for Aaron
Is so you can release all the hostility that you hold inside yourself
I just want you to relax
And keep in mind that this is a safe place
So feel free to curse, cry or any other emotion that might occur during today's visit.
These sessions are confidential
I am only here to listen and not to judge
I'm just here to help you bring the things that are bottled up within... out
Fuck everybody, who doubted me
And said my movements a fallecy
I'm loud and these pussies don't even know how to be
This is the rowdy me
Straight malicious and clowdy me
Demons have crowded me and I really gotta get'em up out of me
Y'all ain't ever known
What's really inside of my dome
Play like I'm weak when I'm strong
So I can peep the ones wrong
They obsolete 'cause I'm gone
This is a speech to condone
I got the beast in my bones
And Y'all bout to reap the unknown
I had every woman you saw Tecca Nina hang wit
Most of there friends they see daily, I dug out and came wit
How can I do this 'cause my brain, it stay on insane shit
Never can a nigga say no names but it's hella pain to retain this
Black's the blood in my veins, how can I cleanse it and drain this?
Disaster was in my lane, but a nigga pinned it and framed it
After me know one thing, who remain on the Strange list?
Have to leave out with a bang, stuck off in the rain, now I hang bitch
What more can I say to you?.. I
Talk until my face is blue... I
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Do you feel me? *It's my last words*
What more can I say to you?.. I
Talk until my face is blue... I
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Can you hear me? *It's my last words*
(Dr. Frazier)
Talk about some of the things that really eat away at you...
Like your career, your music
And don't hold back Aaron, 'cause again these sessions
Are to extract the things that could possibly make you explode
When y'all listen to my music I think y'all take it lightly
But I been raw since the beginning just ask my Uncle Ikey
He will tell you royalty's been planted deep in my psyche
All you peasants hail the king just call me AARON almighty
So when you critique my music you sound like fools to me
And I don't think you deserve to hear another jewel from me
The industry cheated me, repeatedly cruel to me
So now I act conceded guess you needed no grooves from me
I've had it, I'm tired mane
You niggas is fired mane
'Cause you know me and Travis was supposed to inherit thee entire thang
I'm normal, I've never admired fame
I'm just famous 'cause I'm a fuck up and y'all desired pain
So don't talk to me when you see me
Awfully's how you treat me
Off of me, everybody leave me, it costed me never was it easy
So say goodbye to the bad guy a nigga don't have anymore to sell you
This might be the last time you hear a bad guy like Tecca Nina baby, let me tell you
What more can I say to you?.. I *Yeah*
Talk until my face is blue... I
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Do you feel me? *Supposed to be more than this man *
What more can I say to you?.. I
Talk until my face is blue... I
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Can you hear me? *I'm outta here*
See I've been inside out
Y'all heard the best of it
Got no more to give
There ain't no rest of it... there
I'm all out there but y'all don't care
I got no more to bare, yeah.
What more can I say to you?.. I *That's right*
Talk until my face is blue... I *Fuck It*
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Can you feel me? *I gave everything I could give*
What more can I say to you?.. I
Talk until my face is blue... I
Don't look like I'm crazy do I?
Do You feel me?
*I don't wanna hear nothin' else man, I just wanna
Go somewhere with my children, man
Disappear, like dear God
Make me a bird so I can fly
Fly far away from here

Right now fore my goons have to tear it down
We don't wait in line and we don't stand around
We in clubs and we draggin actin' brand new
Actin' like he never seen my face and I ain't got loot
They know I'm Cash Image
And I'm with Tech N9ne
And fore the club close the owner gonna respect mine
We spend a lotta money and that's the bottom line
Ten cars on chrome plus the neck shine
Baggy jeans on and J's worth a lotta bucks
And you ain't gotta know me
You can tell my dollas up
Poppin' collars in the club
Turn the bottles up
And all the models in the club wanna follow us
It's Mr. Chevy man
You hear my song playin'
And every time we in the club we be spending grands
First deny Tech then deny me and I was No. 1 on 103 for 40 weeks
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin' what you standin there for
Who I gotta kill or sleep with
'Cause I'm the world's best kept secret (Let me in)
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin' what you standin there for
'Cause I'm the one that do that music
Ya feel but you still refuse this
Let me in the door
(Verse (D-Loc))
You say you hear me knockin' so why you don't wanna let me in
But I ain't buggin so tell the cops to come and get me in
Complain about my shoes ain't really talking bout shit
Dude I spent like 350 on this outfit
NV ain't gon let me in
Seein as he actin' funny with me
What it gonna cost me homie
I brought a little money with me
I don't wear tight shirts
My pants kinda baggy
KC hat tilted so now they wanna red flag me
I buy the bar every time
Point blank period
The doorman hate takin' his job too serious
Me Cash Image with Tech and Kaliko
About big business so what I'm talking to a bouncer for
The women see me scream my name like the announcer spoke
They actin' brand new this week so I'm about to go
To the block and bubble
And get plenty cake
I just wanted women and I don't like this club anyway
So fuck y'all
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin' what you standin there for
Who I gotta kill or sleep with
'Cause I'm the world's best kept secret (Let me in)
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin' what you standin there for
'Cause I'm the one that do that music
Ya feel but you still refuse this
Let me in the door
(Verse (Tech N9ne))
I get money from music and I like to spend spend
And when I hit the town they gonna let me ins in
But these other clubs gonna be trippin' like I begin sin
You hear me knockin'? Aw yeah well let me in then
Cause NV ain't so friendly
They got a gay assembly of femmes
Who think the blacks be packin semis
That's why they don't sell no Henny
Stink butts who think bucks
But they don't know my bank account is like a Brinks truck
Could buy it any day
2.1 on a new building and lease
The N9ne has plenty say
The rhymin get me paid so I resign
Cause NV gay and plus NV stands for no vaginas anyway
They place me in lil weezy wee give no love
That's why when I bring Chingy in there and he peed in your club
Not in the toilet either (Nope)
You don't enjoy the beaver (Nope)
You'd rather plot on how to give a lil or the peter
America's clubbin phase two I erase you
My pants are too baggy even though I'm clean and I'm paid too
Orlando south races they treated me cold
And Lightening Strike and Power and Light won't let the Nina enter both
Whoa guess my Dickies the wrong clothes
Play my music but won't let me and my homies through the doors
Over one million records sold
Lots of money to fold
They should let me in any club in KCMO
And I'm the biggest tipper
Bartenders know me well
And waitresses love me
So club owners go to hell
You got that goal to sell
But you want this bro to fail
When it really ain't me cause is your destiny to go to jail
And when you be serving you might see work
On Club Nina when you walk up you might be hurt
You might skee skirt
Cause you ain't getting in if you ain't got a KC hat and a white t-shirt (HEY!)
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin' what you standin there for
Who I gotta kill or sleep with
'Cause I'm the world's best kept secret (Let me in)
Let me in the door
If you say you hear me knockin' what you standin there for
'Cause I'm the one that do that music
Ya feel but you still refuse this
Let me in the door
Only reason I even go to the club is so I can listen to some loud music
And drink holler at a Bianc
My neighbors be mad at me 'cause I be shakin the whole block with my system
So that's why I go to the club
I gotta work at the club
Take pictures and sign autographs
Ya know what I mean
I don't need to be in your club for real
And club dollars say I owe 'em 70 dollars I paid 125 dollars to get in
Why you trippin' I just wanted to drink
So if 70 dollars is owed that means some cats were there after I left
Ya know what I mean ha ha put it on my tab"

182,Life Sentences,2015,Special Effects (2015),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"I won't look back anymore, after this
Pitch black, star bright, yeah that's my life
A bit of fire and ice
Watch friends, plot foes, stock ends and pot holes
'Cause when the tank hit the bank, it just got closed
Don't be stank in the paint cause the yak froze
Wish I knew back when I was strugglin'
If I plugged in and kept bustin'
I'd be buzzin', that'd make me super rich
Never knew my sufferin' over but
Cousin, I keep it up and gushin'
And tell all of my family, aunts and uncles, cousins to do the shit
Just gain power through all of the rain showers
No different, remain sour cause someone else's lame hours
Wish I woulda known to tell 'em all to start they own business
Make long digits instead of havin' a boss who talk at the wrong pitches
To fake friends, 'cause it's never enough
At hostile situations with folks, I learned it's better to bust
First, and you still a nigga no matter how much ya stuff's worth
You love who love you, do hug who does true
Connect the true blood to cuzz blue
So keep hopin' the Lord does show up
Cause it'll never be no peace on earth for all of us
Till this mug blow up
Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life
Ponderin' these thoughts while sittin' idle in this mezzanine
Feel my feelin's boilin' up, I'm simmerin' on everything
Goin' for the gold because it's shimmerin', but everything
That you encounter seems to be devoured, need a better team
Every thought and every dream, every plot and every scheme
Lurkin' around the corner is a hater waiting like a fiend
And choice of drug is negative, and they use it like a sedative
Success becomes the cause of this effect, abuse the medicine
You thinkin' you can let 'em in, partake in buildin' excellence
The serpents come in twos and they meticulous with they meddlin'
The feathers flock together, see the relationships we settle in
Got consequences so it's best to let 'em go, we blessed again
Disloyalty unfoiled, trynna justify they pestilence
I don't understand why they so demanding manic pessimists
I guess if I had to guess, I'd make an estimate, I guess that they
Was just afraid so watch us levitate till I'm at heaven's gate
Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life
Mmm, life sentence for fallin' out ya physical body
Illuminate my soul, officially became godly
I be the one, all of these demons runnin' from
Dumped a gun, lifted spirits, niggas deem me the chosen one
Phony family in my crowd, rappin' gap and loud
Facin' twelve in the pen, none of them niggas made a sound
None of them niggas round
Now the fame close and the name boasts
I'm 'posed to break bread bitch, taste toast
I should smoke them ungrateful bitches
They doin' the most to see what make you choke
It actually leave ya throat missin'
I'm on a mission to revisit kin and
My prime been hidden, trynna dine with women
Dipped and find this linen, try and find a business
I love who love Gee, fuck you if it's fuck me
That's just how it gotta be, 'cause I'm paper routin'
Tame nuisance, insane view and check on my lawn
Strange recruit me, guess when the god speakin' Strange Music
Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life
This is the sentence of my life

Hope somebody lets me in,
I need shelter,
From myself, if you can hear me please send help,

Full of pain and strife,
Which direction I'm going I can't tell now,

My brains cookin' the recipe will beckon the best of me killed sections of stepping I feel crazy,
Hit the club in the night with a lil bit of drug in my life and I'm sure lovin' it real hypey I'm delivering,

Just another piece that I wrote, ya know what I'm sayin'
'Cause this beat just wanted me to write it.
Livin' like I'm dying tomorrow, ain't no time for no sorrow,
Throw on my platinum mavoda, rob a gramama collar.
Spray Lucciano Suprana, holla at a mamma whos nanas lover hot like carne asada scholar with a bra like tacara balla
I got a few dollas, hamdullah my fatha taught us to follow Qu'ran and not Osama Bin Lada.
My momma was not a bud of Islam, but God is her wata, so why does the sickness got her like a llama just shot her.
Goose faba wusa, I gotta get out of this ra ra and fly to hana, lu-lu inside a grata, bulu in five lamatas,
No yada yada, they ride on this ride and bob ya then swalla, sun goddess the color of Shaba.
Then I popped a bottle Mascota, run away on my Yamaha vamanos I promisa I'm never no one to be monita-d
By the blue colla coppa, we call 'em Erik Astrata, cha cha, got a wad in my Levis and a nigga neva got ta borrow.
(Krizz Kaliko chorus)
I'm livin' like I'm dyin' tomorrow, so I gotta do a lot of livin' today.
I think I'm gonna drown in a bottle, and party like I'm thinkin' bout goin' today.
I'm seein lots of pretty women, so you know I'm goin' in.
They gon' blow this whole world up, so Imma party until then.
(Kutt Calhoun)
Man I party harder than Nitty and Gucci, Louie with Henny, like I'm dying when I'm on one taking none of them with me,
As sure as my name is Bloody Kutty Cal, you can picture me partyin like it's going outta style.
I, I feel like I'm the best who done did it, most under rated and hated,
But if I die than so be it, then in my head I'm the greatest. It ain't a bitch I ain't christened,
City or state I ain't ventured and if I die my eulogy would be held at the Kemper man.
I've done smoke, I done drank and popped my pills to extremities, still do. Every now and then I pop more than Yosemite,
Keep my foes and my enemies and the ones who pretend to be, close to me, cause honestly there the ones who will hinder me.
So hence forth remember me, this voice is fittin to be his choice of energy, by him I mean all men.
Party like its 1999, smoke my wood tip wine, givin' all my thanks to god then saying Amen.
(Krizz Kaliko chorus)

They gon' blow this whole world up, so Imma party until then.
(Ubiquitous of Ces Cru)
Till summers end and the winter comes,
Till grey days turn to yellow ones.
I stay grindin' for mine I tried to tell them once -
To travel to the moon you got to face the elements,
And battle any goon you gotta cage the elephants.
It's elementary I speak with a certain elequence,
I smoke hella blunts a habit I've been develop since;
I was a young boy, playin' the silver ball.
See 'em stand, feel 'em fall,
Metallica, kill 'em all.
Huh, livin' like this is my last moment;
But a moment could last forever, snap a picture and na-cole it.
Huh do what ever ya gone, sip on your glass,
Hold it up, hit the side on mine get to tippin it back, go in.
Huh, so many days we were sittin' low,
Better get busy livin' till the day you givin' in and you get to go where sinners go.
Pull in the cash, and then spend it slow,
Better make it fast but them should know
Matter no money yo, it's all expendable.

I'm livin' like I'm dyin' tomorrow, so I gotta do a lot of livin' today,

(Godemis of Ces Cru)
Hold your breath count to three Ima kill it,
Killa committee, city chairmen, strapped with a gramma glock and the trigger, bitch, a hair pin.
Three round burst, I aim it at your brain, spit it when cock it I kiss so they call it, Sara Jane.
Livin' like I'm going down tomorrow, sit down and drown in a bottle, go out and get anotha bottle;
I don't lead I don't follow, if I don't eat I get hollow, I don't even play lotto, see Chief I need every dollar.
Y'all don't see me with a model or rockin' a lotta product, I don't smoke like I wanna, I'm stretching this marijuana.
Fuck it I call it karma, if I wake up in nirvana; blood is thicker than water, the mud is even more shallow.
I live in the moment and part of every opponent who pass,
But I put the petal to the metal I got both feet on the gas.
This could be the last verse that I'm writing like it or not everybody's taking to rob and they puttin' you right in a box."

Ever since November hit
I can't remember shit
Unless I was in your chick
When I picked her she was a limber bitch
She say I sent her quick
And treated her as cold as Denver get
That wimper shit for simpers don't enter 'cause I'm winter trick
And I like my hoe's cold young dumb lungs done
Now she's an old soul, ate her like lamber throw rolls
Shorty's come and shorty's go
This skinny chick orgy blows
Horny bro lookin' for thicky
Hunt her down like Lori Stroll
I'm plum start butt naked in my white socks
Might pop my top and hype the block when the light stops
Just call me cyclops
I see what others might not
The white cops are on me, aww man we're in a tight spot
It's ironic though I'm bad yep my mama grow the lad who rob the corner co. for cash up in Monaco
I'm half native got a relative named Jeroni-ho
And this personas fuck the drama only honor dough
I know who died plus and who did it
Shot these sirens can you dig it
Cut off your arm and fan you with it
Some listen to me and say ""damn you wicked""

My neighbors probably wish I resided in hella prison
Cause' they always tell me and Mac to turn down our television
And we got it hooked to our stereo you would think the scenario's
Runnin' the lights when I get on mic

I am your fool
Loving you, I shouldn't
You take me, chain me
I have nothing anymore
(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
You want a regular dude, but you think that I'm what you need?
You gonna get in your mood when I bitch in every text you read
So I think I'm gonna let you breed, but I'm the enemy that set you free
I gotta let you know what gets to me, ready or not like a refugee
You complaining when I see you, that I never have time
That I'm busy as a beaver
Gotta face when I feed ya, really need Hennessy
That be my fucking reliever
Why you wanna stand and cry the most
All you think I'll get up for you to try the coat
Then knot the ho, really wanna tie the ropes
And buy two votes, and hang Nina by the throat
You must really like my imperfections
Cause you stay on dismay, temper detections
And that's nightly, too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts, but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me
(Hook: Tyler Lyon)
What did you ever see in me?
Was I only needed be?
Oh, I'm running away from your judgement
Don't you try to find me
I won't let you change me anyway, anyway
(Verse 2: Tech N9ne)
Yo, I'm feeling stoned now
Sick of having those breakdowns, they gone now
It's on now, I've grown foul, it's wrong how we've shown clouds
You keep your tone out of my dome gal
I'm sick of this shit
All the pickin' and the pullin'
I don't dig it a bit
Livin' and learn what I want
And what I'm givin' 'em livin' 'em diggin' a ditch
Dick I wanna fit up in this
You stayed out of my premises
But you ain't supposed to be my nemesis
Wanna be in to kiss, then I'mma finish it
What happened to close friends with benefits
I'm mad as hell
'Cause I wanna be back when we had it well
All this static's problematic like grabbing a rabbits tail
And that's nightly, too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts, but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me
(Hook: Tyler Lyon)
Do you feel the way I feel?
Is any of these even real?
I'm running away from your judgement
Don't you try to find me
I won't let you change me anyway, anyway

Inside I wanna find somewhere I can hide
Away from all the faded dreams and tainted lies
I wanna tear you up and love you all I want
You quit and score so give me more
Give me more, give me more
(Outro: Tyler Lyon)
So tell me everything's okay
I'm only dying just to be
You wanted only everything
And all you do is kill me
So tell me everything's okay

And all you do is kill me

She love she love me not
But Ill never be all touchy lovey dovey for what he gots
Suddenly kissy huggy what is for me the buddy slot
But they callin on me to put it right in the open it could be an ugly stop
She's lookin' to be caressed on the reg
Fetched on the reg
Sex on the reg
Only Techs on the bread
With nothin' busting percussion and checks on the head
As she huffin and puffin cause wasn't no Tech on the bed
And she don't like that Tech N9ne persona
Groupies more groupies for true the be juicy like John Bedushi (Belushi?)
Like the one that do movies
Man ay caramba you google me I'm beyond the boobies and champaignya
Bumbaclot don't shrug me 'cause I'm the rapper but again you fonded a slacker who's been on your love
Peace in your honor
Just trusting can calm ya
She stoned
Now I'm home
But she gon love me mañana

Just because expanded you (bantered who?) like soft musical (xanadu?)
But I'll be damn if you slander who Tech Ninna
My crew cannibals ain't no fan it
You man who do a lot in a jam or two
Said I'm a sell out 'cause I worked with Wayne
First your brain need work
You hurt the game
Every lyric that blurst put the earth shame
How do we burst to fame if both of our verse the same
We supposed to be different
You know that gifted
'Cause what we spit
You know that we live it
We grow 'cause we vivid
You's a fair weather fan
Your predictions will never stand
Like you know something better than when I'm chopping
Whatever man
I told my fans, that, I told them this years ago. I said Tech will never go mainstream, mainstream will go Tech.

I hear ya saying that I ain't the same
But in order to grow you know you got to change
But you gon love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow) x3

Here today but be gone when you blink an eye
Constant drinking got you thinking and you about cry
I was forsaken life taken and feel the pain
Heart breakin body shakin can you stand the rain
I was a friend of thee but treated like an enemy
But now I'm gone just a portion of your memories
But in your memory remember this vividly
There was no other villain from the hood real as me
From the soil none loyal like the B.I.G.
Homie from the show me hope that's how you 'member me
And we'll soon see I ain't got long to be
On this earth claiming turf running in these streets
I apologize homie look me in my eyes
Time to turn the page and be a man and swallow pride
To many homies died before I got to say my piece
So I just said piece and hopin that it brings us peace

Today is gone and I left this place
But I'll be the sun shining on your face
So just love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow

How could I be so down at a time like this, when I'm high like this
When the Billboard Charts when your major tours overseas when I fly like this
I be thinking about the people that need me
They needy and all of the pain that I might miss
Sooner or later it seeks me, reach me then bleed me, deep in the rain inside my pit
I'm going down now, because my mom frowns
In a research psychiatric center without her son around
And I'm deep off in this hole
When I'm out here rockin' shows (they say)
I should be hyped cause my life is so rock 'n' roll
But I feel like the Grinch mixed with Ebenezer Scrooge
Let the fever ooze up out of me, clouded me never eager to
Let up when I'm in an interview, they probably thinkin' they gonna hinder dude
'Cause he be lookin' like he might offend the rule
Never intricate to remember blues
Because he's always right here
With the Hennessy and light beer
Let it enter me and fight fear, yeah
I know I quit but I started back
The homey called the gat
And my bodyguard Nicholas just had a heart attack
(Chorus - Krizz Kaliko)
I'm sinking again, I'm drinking again
Drownin and wildin you breathin' again
It's easy to sin when you bleeding within'
Needin the grin, cheese and recede in the spin
Lower than low, lower than low
That's how I feel in the morning
Lower than low, lower than low
That's how I sound when you callin'
Lower than low, lower than low
I'm high but feel like I'm falling I'm sorry but I'm feeling lower than low
(Verse 2 - Tech N9ne)
My smile is forced
My style is warped
Moraless corpse
Now that my really good pound is torched
I'm just gone with the wind and I'm home with the gin
To the dome when I spin
I'm a zone cause the phone must be roamin again
Another tone I'm alone now don't want me to spin
Time with I'm just mind this
Might find Miss N9ne missed
I find my mind in this line dish
Dine quick not even a second for mindless
In a middle of a time when the musics flyin I've depleted my kindness
Low like the grasses, low like po folks on grass shit
I'm so below the casket, ragged pulse uf the maggots
Why do I feel this illness, I'm lookin' for somethin' to come and kill this a little bit
I got my head in the hills cause the real shit is momma is sufferin takin' pills with the stillness
And I feel it
I can't shake it
In any case my space is the basement
I can't erase my embrace of encasement
I'm chasin hatred my taste not complacin'
So as I go to the flo'
The industry finally opened the door
But now I'm in the mothafucka all I feel is, low
(Chorus - Krizz Kaliko)
I'm sinking again, I'm drinking again
Drownin and wildin you breathin' again
It's easy to sin when you bleeding within'
Needin the grin, cheese and recede in the spin
Lower than low, lower than low
That's how I feel in the morning
Lower than low, lower than low
That's how I sound when you callin'
Lower than low, lower than low
I'm high but feel like I'm falling I'm sorry but I'm feeling lower than low"

Back to rip shit
Crush yourself, it's the lunatic
Strapped with my chrome to they domes
And leave your fuckin' wig split
Competition fear me, they can't get near me
Step into the circle and I'll take you on a dream through my Elm street
It's reality that you're facin'
The funk will surround you, then you'll start shakin'
Welcome to my concentration camp
There's no need to try to run, 'cause I've gotcha caged like a rat
I know ya feel the pressure, from your head to your feet, wishing that you could wake up from this deadly sleep
But there's no way out as your heart no longer beats
You breathed your last breath... heh... death, death
Takes ya 'round the corner puts somethin' mad on ya
You're lost without a clue, bitch, oh, by my voodoo
You wake up with screams, knowing what you saw was no illusion
You're going crazy from my mad confusion...
(Tech N9ne)
Flippin' about ta flow
And about to bust anotha
Hangin' from a nuse in this
I won't be talkin' about no upside down crucifix
No relation with any Satan, me, a Don Juan
Never commin' evil like the necronomicon
My word is Bond if you enter
What I'm into is a psycho-flow-rhythmic-hymn with triple limb
Now ya know
Millimetre, nigga, bring 'em all with the wreck game
Rip fools like Singapore with the wet pain
Full, niggas hangin' under (underground)
The level of madness
Step into some real shit and feel this
Why? I have no time for the punk shit
Run it back, run it back
Tihs knup eht rof emit on evah I
And now I gotta hold on that encephalon
Me havin' dreams makin' green like the leprechaun...
(How'dya like the gold buckles on me shoes?)
Keepin' ordinary minded people confused from my mad confuse"

Pull my windpipe out, that or the thing of a singer

Oh shit his bone's stickin' out I think it's broken

You go ass kiss anybody the blow as is
You try to be somethin' you're not my shit is dope as is
You got some dope ad-libs and that's sick as shit
It's so average, we ain't similar, homie check ya temperature
You fuck with me and you will need a medical examiner
Put hands on rappers ramblin', put handles on ya manager
They said I'm from Atlanta, damn it I am not from Canada
I came in the game and I represented
Jonny Valiant in this bitch there's no mystery
They'll be killin' it, keepin' it independent
Tecca Nina is the leader given me the check
I hate it now say no more I'ma get 'em

Lets go, yeah
I feel this one man
And this one is long overdue
It's 'bout my mama nem
My mama, her sisters, her brothers, grandma too man
I just wanna take this time to speak about mama nem
Yeah,
Check it
(Tech N9ne - Verse 1)
She carried me when she was fifteen
Had me when she was sixteen
Reminiscing on how well she did things
Got one popped on 11/8/71 she had this king
She was baring that on day
I was just a staring upon that face
With her, just declaring my mum said wait
Then her and her sisters named me Aaron Dontez Yates
She, tried to give me everything I seen
KCP&L gas service was her means for green
Took me to the movies when they brought Halloween to screen
Got me a big wheel couldn't afford a green machine
But I loved it,
When I got it, all my friends swarming
Cause in the projects big wheels wasn't the norm
And I'm pouring this out to the woman I'm adoring
She know I like sugar snacks and a fried baloney sandwich in the morning
(Krizz Kaliko - Chorus)
Mama
I take you everywhere I go
I thank you're mine, that's my momma nem
I only know what I know cause of my mama nem
She gave me life and made me me
I don't know where I'd be without
My auntie nem, my sisters and, my uncle nem
Mama nem
(Tech N9ne - Verse 2)
When I got bad grades I was in the heat seat
Got a woopin' when I used another kids cheatsheet
But when I got a good grade card she bought me Beat street
The single, ayo I had that mug on repeat
Mama nem taught me rhythm that I use yep
My uncle nem say's stay on your P's and Q's neph'
Mama talking catch you, if you talking like you deaf
God-fearing still taught me how to two-step
Took me to church, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Than Sunday thinking why me
That was mama nem placin' the love inside me
Our house was lively
My granny house, 8 girls and 4 boys beside me
Thanking Mama nem, for the weight that you carry
Pulling my teeth with friends sayin' ""boy, you scary""
I 'memba mama laughin' sayin' ""Is it loose?""
""Very""
Pull it then, put cash in my pillow sayin' it's the tooth fairy
(Krizz Kaliko - Chorus)
Mama
I take you everywhere I go
I thank you momma
I only know what I know cause of my mama nem
She gave me life and you made me who
I don't know who I'd be without
Auntie nem, my sisters and, my uncle and
Mama nem
(Tech N9ne - Verse 3)
Epilepsy at 18, the lupus hit her
Pancreatitus was taking her but God was with her
I asked to show me something 'cause I was all bitter
Right after that the pancreatitus had all withered
Mama? ""Yeah""
Mama! ""What?""
MAMA! ""WHAT Boy?""
I'm a big timer
I'm always away from you cause of this music biz drama
But I really miss you and I'm always thinking 'bout big mama
She used to make that Thanks Giving and Christmas dinner
Grandma's home cooking easily show up missing winters
Mama nem would take you in even if you're vicious sinner
Nobody would ever take that humungous love that's within her
If your mama gone, heavens where mum belongs
Or if your momma home, call ya mama phone
And say I love you momma and you are not alone
I just wanted to thank you and that's why I made this mama song
(Krizz Kaliko - Chorus)
Mama
I take you everywhere I go
I thank you mama

She gave me life and you made me who

196,Meant to Happen,2013,Something Else (2013),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Cause it was all meant to happen
It was all meant to happen
No wonder why you kept walkin' my way
Cause it was all meant to happen
It was all meant to happen
No wonder why you kept walkin'
My mom was 18, waitin' for her prom date
Which was my father, yes, this night's gonna be beyond great
Two years prior they both created Aaron Yates
So the bond straight with two fine mates, so mom waits
And waits, in the upstairs window watchin'
For my pops and it was shockin' that he never ever came knockin'
Just left her, in her prom dress and that's the eve
Where all the stress hit aggressively, she had her first epileptic seizure
And kept havin' them, doctor, help the sick lady
Medicine with the quickness, just maybe it'll stop
'Member this, in '80 I was, nine
Asleep and I heard somethin' collapse
Hopped up with nothin' but tighty whitie
Saw my mom just fell and slapped the floor
She shakin', I'm scared, I ran out the house in my underwear
""Help my mama"" is all that's comin' out my mouth
A neighbor came to help so mama wouldn't die
As a little kid, watchin' the ambulance take her away, I'm thinkin' ""Why?""
Cause it was all meant to happen
It was all meant to happen
No wonder why you kept walkin' my way
Cause it was all meant to happen
It was all meant to happen
No wonder why you kept walkin'
'92, I was 21
Sellin' rocks for my auntie, was plenty fun
And yes she loaded the house with many guns
She got me a TEC-9 for my birthday, ""No more trippin' from anyone""
Is what I'm thinkin', Boones Farm's what I'm drinkin'
Singin' Jodeci loaded, we exploded, these chicks I'm binkin'
Daily, nightly, the ladies like me, I'm baby Ikie,
Maybe slightly, I'm crazy might be
Really shady, sheisty not like this though
I'm sleepin' again, this dude breaks in with a pistol
I heard his bullet whistle, so I had to roll of on this flo'
Heard a struggle then my auntie scream, I'm feelin' for my piece
Then, just my luck, my birthday gift that I got wasn't in my reach
The gunman busted in my room lookin' for somethin'
Found me hidin', pointed the gun right at my head, my heart was pumpin'
Then he turned and ran away then with a blink of an eye
He was gone, I found my auntie shakin', hidin' in the closet, I'm thinkin' ""Why?""
Cause it was all meant to happen
It was all meant to happen
No wonder why you kept walkin' my way
Cause it was all meant to happen
It was all meant to happen
No wonder why you kept walkin'
Dear Darkness, you've been with me for so long
I never understood, till now in this slow song
Been in some shaky situations, but life goes on
But still, a lot of things you showed this kid was so wrong
But what's so right, this pain and strife that I go write
People go buy it, they think that my flow's tight
Got a cold mic, they got me a million sold twice
Not a low-life anymore it's always sold-out show nights
After K.O.D. you scared me, so I ran from you
Then accepted you on Seepage, then saw the fans come through
Just when I thought I took everything I can stand from you
I kept writing and then we watched the Strangeland come true
So now I see, these stories in my life
I was meant to share my darkness within my light
People say it helps them to see me fly
From the bottom, that's motivation for them all, now I see exactly why
Cause it was all meant to happen
It was all meant to happen
No wonder why you kept walkin' my way
Cause it was all meant to happen
It was all meant to happen
No wonder why you kept walkin'"

(1st verse: Tech N9ne)
It started on the slave shift
If field niggas would eventually take the day shift
Would house niggas inside loyalty may shift
And identify us now we still need a race lift
Fuck a face lift I ain't changing my identity
For energy for any that's obsenity
Now in 2000 and 7 we sippin ain't no remidy
Jealousy Indian murder like you in kinamy
Guess we ain't nigga we go hard in the paint nigga
Still when you see me out you ain't the one who faint nigga
It's the other fans from the other lands
They listen to me more then my sister and brother man

Never uplift a demond with an image of my ancester
African act like you see me when you be traffican
Laughter when you frown up at me your hatrid is baffelin
You watch American idol my people might paint the tribalin
Symbolizes not evil but that were still survival
You niggas be so tuff the moment we roll up
Your upper lip rollled up you hatin' me so wut
Everyone knows us my city is sold up
My shows crushed but cha don't show up

Brother linch, 40 water, federation, dmx
Buster rhymes, quincy, and x clan found me
Brother jay homie he whipped me till this day homie
Who you know is blacker then that
With a staffer and lack
My people up in the tragidy and they rap

Who that? Who that? That's me
Who that? Who that? K-Dean
When I was comin' up in the game everybody was tellin' me
""I really be killin' a lot of you niggas, I'm mean""
Fuckin' with my niggas D-Loc and Dalima
They told me, ""I really gotta be a muderer killin' machine""
I didn't care about nothing but rappin' my way to the top
Fuckin' with my nigga Tech, he told me I'm hot
Anybody got a problem with any one of my niggas
I'll pulled out the nine milli up and to a pop
Bring the heat, bring the noise, bring the flames
Anything that you bring, Imma tame
Puttin' dirt on the top of my name
Pull back and I click-click, bang
Ask Tech, he'll tell you I'm strange
If you ever wanna talk about me
Imma run up, gun up and leave you with no brain
Then you'll know my flow is insane
I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
Even though I'm all up in the Northwest
All across the U.S.
Overseas, Midwest Choppers
Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)

Come, come get some of this

Let me hit 'em
When I get 'em, Imma split 'em, Imma kill 'em
I'm the nigga with the lyrical venom, finna get up in them
When they give me the instrumental
I finish 'em, diminish 'em
I guarantee the murda is a minimum
But lately I been givin' 'em hell
They don't really wanna see me, I'm so damn swell
Call me a monster, verse designer, first to bomb ya
Leathaface pullin up in that hearse beside ya
Murda, mo murda, mo murda, mo murdered 'em all, kill 'em all
Krayzie kill 'em all, they fall
It's a lyrical execution
We snap faster, we the rap masters
Squeeze the gat, blast it, if that's how it gots to be
So they better get it ready
'Cause I'm heated like an AK-47 spittin' bullet fuckin' lyrics out of me
Well that's somethin', that's crazy, Jackson
He's amazin action, stay in action
Rap singin' at ya, I'm blazin' at ya
I'm kinda like an automatic aimin at ya
And I don't want a little bit of flame to ashes
You know you really truly insane to madness
You're never gonna find other niggas more scandalous

I am the definition of murda
The N9ne is now coming to serve ya
You're running but you can't go no furtha
'Cause I'm running through you with no sign of inertia
Gimme the mic and I bet that you duck
It's what you betta do when I'm bussin
I be flippin, I'm incredible, never get on my level
I'm a killa with the pedal to the medal
You're edible and ya death is so inevitable
I can take it to ya momma, ya daddy, the back of a caddy
You cut up in the sack with a baggy and I wanna
Take it out and make it patty
You gotta be patty
Cause that'll be bad if you decide to mad, is you gonna?
You can listen to me and see I'm the nigga with the ammunition
I'm givin' the livin' a vision of death
Makin' 'em sick and depressed
'Cause I be givin' everything
I'm a rebel and I'm still with the quick and the best
Makin' 'em walk in the business
I get up in it to rip and diminish ya
Trip and I finish ya
Dig it, you really get me livid, I'm bout give it a pivot
Imma stick it so we can differ to sinister
I be the chopper that got ya little boppers goin' off us
Better not let me up on the premises
'Cause I'm a doctor that's out for the shotas when I brought ya
Be cautious never talk of this nemesis
We on top of the hill when it come to the skill
Other rappers are damn jokers
They be givin' the people comedy
But the Tecca Nina misery shit is Bram Stoker

Like if I had a Thirty-Eight right now I could make you do just about anything I wanted to
Just about all my life people have been doing that to me
Yes, but if they kill without conscious how can they be treated?
How can we recognize them before it happens again?
I think we're all expecting these killers to be frothing-at-the-mouth-maniacs
The scary thing is that seemingly normal people commit these crimes they can act like anyone your friend, a teacher, a guy next door
I just think we live in such a violent society
Seemed like a regular guy, you know normal kinda quiet, but uh pretty smart, H-he just didn't seem like the kinda of guy that would kill anyone you know? I mean it doesn't make any sense
They don't think that you're worth anything, you're in their way.

How does it FEEL, to have a nigga that will KILL yah,
For the foul shit you spit?
Number one snitch
A bitch with a dick
I found the remedy for the enemy
(What)?
Bust at the nigga like shootin at the Kennedy's
Cause Mitch Bade ain't really no friend of me!

To be exact
He's that nigga that talk, but he really can't back that shit that he talk
So he gotta walk around with a gat
But a nigga like me, I'll knock him out with the force of a hurricane
The penalty for the path if you disrespect the game

Now what goes on inside the mind of a nigga like this?
The nigga pissed
As I pumped off four rounds up in the trick he was with
But It ain't my fault you a little ole' bitch

Nigga run with a quickness
(Get away quick, but you bet not slip)
Better of with a Bianca then be stuck

So I um, got prepared, My conscience told me grab the gat
But all I could think about, was hittin that kitty kat from the back
All about that hustle, but tonight I gosta kick it
Deep conversation, but it's her first time letting a nigga hit
But I'm not alone, It seems this nigga was on the phone
He heard the spot, the topic, whicked whicked, now it's on!
As I continue (continue) creepin' (creepin') it's apparent
That I'm dealin' with a Mitch Bade, I guess that's why he keeps on stareing
But I'm well equipped to handle a fleet, so nigga don't think I'm sleep

So we just changed your name

Dippen up on bitches, but the jealous Mitch is ready to shoot, peep
But it ain't complete, the day is foul without a big butt and smile
I need a chick that's running wet like Fury of the Nile
Bumped into, stepped into, this chick that's thick and photo genic
In a minute, I'ma get up in it, with a jimmy to avoid that AIDS epedemic
Get it, got it, good in the hood, shit's all good, so I knocked on wood
Got to her crib, drank some crown, laid me down, showed me the goods
Then, knock knock, ""who's that?""
She said her man and he might be strapped with a gat
Put back on my shit, time to show this fool just where it's at
Ret to get wet, she opened it up enough so I could see
She cracked it a bit, but that nigga pushed her, then came after me
Extended arm, and bodily harm
He shoulda caught trigga, chiggas

So I had to move to L to A you got the sail away so you can get the mail today 'cause everybody fails to pay
When you nadda, rapper who got a lotta
Money or women in who steady in them Gotchis or Pradas
You just a low life maggot gettin' money from momma
N when you broke all you gettin' is drama
The worlds paranas if you a big fish, because they nibble 'n' nibble till you die! Buggin you till you buy! That's why we be stressin, poppin', puffin, till we high! Hystarical 'cause miricals need wings to fly! My god, you can put this off in your iPod
After you cop it 'cause droppin' rockets is my job/ Look at my wallet, you got it I keep a nice wad
Gettin' riches 'n' dissin bitches like Ty Cob
This is Everready The Religion...

So these mother fuckers can feel what I'm saying
Yea, like that... Yo
Monster
Monster
Monster
Monster
When I was five years old
I realized there was a road
At the end I would win lots of pots of gold
Kindergarten teacher knew I was impossible
Gots to grow dick quick to cock the hoe
Evil breed we smoked weed without seed teed
Do dirty deeds feed foul fiends what they need
Walked around with a switch blade in sixth grade
You'll get blade if you displayed bits of mitch bade
Have you ever, sold a preacher, crack on Sunday?
Fucked your teacher, seventh grader, under bleachers
Losing data, smoking refer
Hostile amigo, hasta luego
I say to fake hoes, after I pop, I stop and I stay low
Damn clown from Kan town, many man found
It's a monster breed here nigga, stand down
(Monster) If you wanna act like me
(Monster) You gotta pop a gat like me
(Monster) Make a nigga scat like me
(Monster) Dumping hella crack like me
(Monster) You can always act like me
(Monster) Ain't gotta be black like me
(Monster) Keep a hold of your brat tightly
(Monster) He just might be (Monster)
It must be in my blood
It must be in my soul
I'm musty in the mud
I'm dusty in my clothes
Don't trust me, I'm a scud
Don't fuck with me, I'm cold
I'm quick to hold a grudge
Don't touch I might explode
I'm made for wrong
Spent too many days alone
Blaze the bong
Hey, too many cervezas, homes
And it get shittier
Hit me a, Bitch up on Lydia
Accidentally passing, Chlamydia
What kind of nigga, take ex
Ain't never heard of, safe sex
What kind of nigga, never think of learning
Make a smoker suck his dick, while he's burning
Who that nigga, chugging liquor with Slim Shady bumping?
(Tech N9ne) Who shot them niggas, down on the Landing in eighty something?
(Tech N9ne) Who hit Dillard's, who think they know where evil lurks now?
(Tech, Tech) Who that committing sexual acts on church grounds?
(Monster) If you wanna act like me

Momma never knew what's up
She never knew I would turn beast when I grew up
She never thought that I know clucks
Or hung with niggas in the hood who never gave a fuck
Imma, creature from a black platoon
Pass the shrooms last for doom with half a moon
Still howling Lord knows I've been a very, bad boy
Fucking ""Little Lori"" in Forest Hill Cemetery
Definition of a bad boy
Used to hit niggas for recognition never had joy
And I, never ever really had toys
So I, started playing with thirty-eights making mad noise
Who killed fetus', Who needed his G.H.B
To get heated, immediate
We get weeded, be on some conceited shit
Many more coming, because, because, because
It's dark off up in Kansas City nigga, ""Land of Oz""
(Monster) If you wanna act like me
(Monster) You gotta pop a gat like me
(Monster) Make a nigga scat like me
(Monster) Dumping hella crack like me
(Monster) You can always act like me

(Monster) He just might be (Monster)
That's real... It's just a piece baby
It's just a little piece of the story
I got much, much more to tell you... yea

Steady shooting for the stars
On this vertical journey I be recruiting more for bars
Gotta be hard, in the car
I'm running with cannons that really loosen your regards
Greedy money, and then some
These motherfuckers will murder you for your income
So when the flash the pass to begin some
Spitting my favorite to Prozak and Lynch Hung
After the shows I'm thinking about food
Just give me some vittles and a drink and I'm cool
You probably thinking that a womans my juice
But I drool over Italian cooking is my joo
I eat all of it all the time
At the mall even y'all
When they called the n9ne
Money tall yes I ball missing all the sign
... we could meet but never draw the line
Doctor said that my blood pressure pew
I was healthy for one minute but then fumes
Of a pepper corn fillet within the room
I gotta go get it soon, you seeing the nigger zoom
Capital grill and a melting pot
They know my name PF Chang so they help a lot
You let the n9ne cut the line when its sweltering hot
to wine and dine me and we belting lot
I can't stop eating, I really love eating
I know my body be wishing I was vegan
The fat of my stomach it was leaving me, feeding me
All I be thinking when I be breathing un evely
It don't matter, I'm taking it to the head
Tucking my tummy they using bigger thread
Telling me if I dont be careful and kill the bread
Im gonna pig out until a nigga dead

I crave it, yes I love it, that's my favorite

I'm an addict,... I never pay
Kamikaze coming closer to my blood stream
Caffeine, nicotine, medical green
??????????????????
prepare for lift off, stimulation drift off
If I don't feed my addiction I get pissed off
All these voices...
I got the devil in my right hand
Always leaving me decitful theivery
procedes to impede so theres not much steem in me
in need to feed to be stuffed in eagerly
I can't seem to leave it be and be free
Feel my synapses, collapsing im gasping
I think I'm going down like Michael Jackson
Tunnel vision everything is going black
And im headed to a place where ther never is no coming back
Swan dive in a lake of fire
All thanks to my faithful drug suppliers
Now the taste is a taste like you all subscribers
under the reigns of the chains of your own desires
Your new god is in black atire
Never slave to his rays you can not defy him
Such a waste to the race til your life expires
no escape, given chase like Michael Meyers

6 in the morning I be off these
Yeling 6 in the morning like my nigger has tea
I pop all of it all the time
And they put me in the zone when I'm writing rhymes
Drugged out, about to take the mug out
Taking gallons of water I gotta get the drug out
So stuck like I'm sniffing coke up
And I love it just as much as I love eating cold cuts
Yeah I'm the nigger that eat ya whole lunch

Date rape about to set a rape tape

All up in that ass again Mayday

211,My Haiku - Burn the World,2013,Something Else (2013),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"This is my haiku
The sick pedophile
Touching beautiful kiddies
Really gonna die
I think the world needs more light
'Cause what they do in the dark too haneous for your sight
And mine is dark all the time
A sign to design true crime
But I'm blessed to have the platform for this rhyme
Damn, why wasn't the light on baby girl
Grown men touch her, she 4, livin' on this crazy world
That's gonna affect her way longer than the lightest life span
If I was there, I'd be sparking way more than a light man
But if we shine em' all, together we can run them off
Gonna hardslide on everyone he come across
Molotovs go to slavery in the Holocaust
Lotta chalk, you ain't lit up, then you not a boss
Light the darker alleys, it might just spark a rally
For right these hearts are rowdy, tonight we spark the valleys
In flatlands stoppin' the bad man, we'll grab hands
Girl he groping going in the trash can
Nowhere to hide I must say places ain't light enough
You try to cut the bright of us an idol might just erupt
The fine of dusk would light as the night adjust
If you got em' then light them up
There was a lighter in everybody's hand
The world would seem brighter
The sky would be fire
We'd raise our hands and burn the world
So raise your hands and burn the world
Hey,
Why did Adam shoot the school up?
Maybe cause the way he grew up
Maybe cause of loose screws
Scratched out cause mama loved to pick the tool up
Now a marathon done blew up
And it's bout has two nuts
When Castro took the kids for about ten years and what he'd done I almost threw up
If them was my youngins I'd try to bring the sun in closer to them
Turn it up a hundred and hold it up to them
Take a bite and chew them
Some of they baby life they ruined
I'd be going crazy on the daily daily
I'd pursue them
Don't need more reasons to turn this to a fire pit
Barbecue, I would do, right find without all of it
It's awful and off to no resolving it
Molotovs make the night brighter
There was a lighter in everybody's hand
The world would seem brighter
The sky would be fire
We'd raise our hands and burn the world
So raise your hands and burn the world
Yeah,
Depresin' to seeing them
Was heaven 'cause we had sinned
The reverend is begging brethren to be seven and being friends
Tecca don't wanna see kiddies die
Mine is in the stretcher, so what you gonna do with them 25 lighters on your dresser
Yessir, shine them bright so they see us off in Mecca
Lessen the threats of the meth would step in with death and press us
To mess a, good will divide up a fight
Being right and polite, come and help me light up the night
Shine your light bright, but I finally can't rape her
People stand together, make the place safer
No time to play when I weigh the straight haters
'Cause they fakers and doing evil is they nature
This is for kids that once and often go through my head, they don't wanna run so off them
I don't want no sack on my pants, so I'm asking her friend,
""Just keep a list so this don't happen again.""
There was a lighter in everybody's hand
The world would seem brighter
The sky would be fire
We'd raise our hands and burn the world
So raise your hands and burn the world
A wonderful musician once said
""If the people that are trying to destroy this world aren't taking a day off, then why should I?""
I feel that
So how do I light up the darkness, Mr. Bob Marley?
This is my attempt right here
I'm trying"
212,My Own Hell,2005,Vintage Tech (2005),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(Intro 1 (Taken from Freaky))
I really don't have to tell you much about this one because the song is
Like the song is like self-explanatory. You know what I mean? It's
Called My Own Hell. Story about me, and Midwestside, and Hogstyle
Records, and people around me, and my wife, and stuff like that. Pretty
Personal. Real ruff copy. It's the only one we got. You know what I
Mean? I think y'all really love the story. People are nosey and want to
Know about my life so check this out; this is called My Own Hell
Produced by Don Juan
Nigga, my life is straight conflict
When all I want to do is kick it hard and make bomb shit
Every perimeter I enter is infested with a sinner
Seems like I'm losing and never coming out the winner
Shit, I'm the only one kicking it, everyone else plotting and scheming
But yet they never listen when I say I'm a little piece of love and a
Pit full of demons
Midwestside was record company comprised of all friends
Who grew up together and shared ends
Nobody stepped on nobody's toes
Don Juan was executive producer, Juan had beats I had flows
Scoob and Txx Will did promotion
Got it where Mitch Bade was the shit and got Kansas City open
Juan got that shit to Quincy Jones through a chick named Mona
Three days later Q called us back and it was on
Q told us to wait on putting the record out indy
The record company will make it to where we'll have plenty
So we waited. Should we put this out? We debated
But working with Quincy we were elated
So now we on the road to L.A. and it was live
Till we got to Quincy's and Don Juan to Scooby and them to wait outside
That's when the tension started to build
Niggaz started feeling unappreciated and then shit got real!
'97 Quincy called back for me and Juan
I told my Rogue Dog niggaz just to remain calm
I'm bout to make it so we can bling. Get us nice things
And then Don Juan said, ""let's mash for our dreams.""
Scooby didn't like the way he spent his money on promos
T-shirts and money to make room for logos
He thought he wasn't appreciated, Midwestside depreciated
Gone for the summer and everybody waited
Bakarii didn't like the fact he was down with Mitch Bade
He felt that he should be the next nigga to get paid
Txx Will got tired of being lectured
On distribution so the anted up and started Hogstyle Records
My niggaz wanted me to ride
Hell yeah I'm down, Tecca Nina's on both sides
Hogstyle's like ""Fuck 'em, 'cause they didn't believe in 57
Midwestside's the same, but the love, I'm trynna find my way to heaven
Yo... This is my own hell, nigga this is my own hell
Just trynna make my records sell
Off in my own hell, nigga this is my own hell
We want to Cali to hook with QD3
They wanted the superstar to be me
Kicked it with big Q off in the wild wild west they signed me to Quest
Didn't know I was in for some more perspective mess
Quest fighting Midwestside over a single
All the way from the love angel to Chris Cringle
CEO of Midwestside fighting QD over my budget
QD fighting quest 'cause he never loved it
Warner Bros. Fighting back and forth with my artists
'Cause the bitch who's handling money is retarded
Quest don't like Midwestside, QD3 don't like Quest
And I'm sitting in the middle depressed
Warner Bros send me four Gs a month
I'm kickin it at parties. Liquor, weed, and cunts
When everybody's fussing and fighting
I'm suffering peacefully like novacaine
That's because I didn't know the game
Midwestside, Juan, and QD3
Q-W-E-S-T fighting over me
Sway and Tech fighting Q over a check he didn't pay
But I suffer. Yeah, I suffer at the end of the day
Yo... This is my own hell, nigga this is my own hell
Just trynna make my records sell
Off in my own hell, nigga this is my own hell
My female friends started not to like my woman
When they found my marriage was comin'
My wife didn't like my friends from the get go
She say them bitches ain't nothing but fucking famous rapper niggaz for
The grip hoes
Wifey don't like me hanging out with E and Beans
'Cause when we be seeing E and Beans wifey be seeing things
Beans don't like Sheryl 'cause Sheryl fine a hell
And Beans things Sheryl will take the dick to show and tell
Sheryl don't like Beans 'cause Beans rude
She wish Beans would go back to Chicago with her dude
Sayin' he don't like Dr. Wick
But Dr. Wick don't give a shit
Zany got Nicky waiting for the hit
Wifey study entire 'cause something look fishy
'Cause all my relations iffy iffy
Wifey thinks Big (?) would try to fuck
Big (?) knew if he try wifey was down to buck
Now all these niggaz in my rhyme are my people
No one can save them not even a steeple could make the equal
You're all my sisters, my brothers
But I'm tired of mediating. I'mma sit back and watch y'all kill each
Motherfucking other
Yo... This is my own hell, nigga this is my own hell
Just trynna make my records sell
Off in my own hell, nigga this is my own hell
This is my own hell, nigga this is my own hell
Just trynna make my records sell
Off in my own hell, nigga this is my own hell"

Out the roof, scoop the groupie troupe in large crowds
Yes we are foul
And we rich now
Used to be all of me, but it's all on a bitch now
They wanna get me stuck, they come into my world
It's too late I got, my wife, my bitch, my girl
(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
I was nineteen
Met a nice queen
Car was bright green
Naughty as ice cream
But she too jealous Nickaleas
Sort of ridiculous
With the liffa kickin' it
We can never be inconspicuous (My bitch)
Rolls with me
And so sickly
In love with me
But she give me Felicia 'ol hickeys
But go get me, in the wee hours to get me slow quickys
So sticky
Roll with my homies she so shifty (My wife)
Married a monsta
Carried a youngsta
Said if you cheated it would come back to hunt ya
She said my filthy world
Makes her wanna hurl
And that's my first verse
My wife, my bitch, my girl
(Hook: Tech N9ne) 2X
Daddy told me that you wanna control the chicks
You gotta go blow her grip
'Cause it's all on a bitch
One is no trip
And two is just more lip
But three I can cope with

Got a nice anus
And it's right ain't it
Can't really touch durin' the day but in the night taint it
Usin' fight language
When she take inches
Great bitches
Gettin' busy on the weight benches (My bitch)
Got a big butt
A big slut
Who get big bucks
You might look up and get your chick sucked
'Cause she's bi-sex
Keep her thighs wet
Spontaneous I don't know what we gon try next (My wife)
Got a ghetto booty like Naomi
Imma tell you like Jayo say
All my bitches havin' fancy dreams
And all my bitches wear Applebottom jeans
My wife, my bitch, my girl
(Verse 3: Tech N9ne)
If one's trippin' the other's for fun pimpin'
You cool
She runs lip and you end up with funds missin'
You fool
Come wicked your women becomes vicious and cruel
Dumb trick gets a ? and some checks and you loose
Out of balance the playalistical values and lyin'
I done challenged the way of Mystical powers and hype
I can silence an egotistical chick in a fight
I'm defiant with an evil twist my girl, bitch, and my wife
Ain't no bitch on this planet that is a match for me
They get sick and they stand it cause Ninna packs the three
Have to be
Crash to see
If naturally to cause a catastrophe
Exsactaly (My wife)
Don't like me (My bitch)
Get's hyphy (My girl)
Might knife me twice just to spite me (My wife)
If I break her heart (My bitch)
It'll rip her apart (My girl)

But when we finally fuck at night, it's too taboo for the stuck up type
And we don't need no porn, we turned on from the foreplay that we perform
I work wonders with my fingers, had it squirtin' in my hand like a squeezin' orange
We both freakazoids, tried all the creams and oils, all the beats and tours
We love fuckin', when she bleedin' I leave it in with no rubber
Leavin' hotel comforters and sheets destroyed, is that TMI?
She can I don't give a fuck, choke her out havin' angry sex
So take it out and let her taste the 'cillin
She deep-throated with no gag reflex
Whoever taught her that can have respect
I let her have my Strange chain while I fuck her with my skully on
Remember when I fingered you in Kroger
We thought we were discreet but a couple people probably saw
We act like a couple teenagers, the both of us grown as hell
While you were up, like a ponytail and let our neighbors hear us moan and yell

216,Need Jesus,2016,The Storm (2016),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Let ye cast no judgement upon thy neighbor
Before the beam of thy own eyes have been cleansed
In the wicked ways of the world
God gives the remission for all of our sins
When I was a young one the preacher put oil on my sixth chakra
He knew when I was older I'd wanna follow 2Pac and Big Papa
They thought I was so devilish in the dark I would listen to sick opera
But this choppa will be reppin' the city where RDV's Young Rich and Slick's got ya
Well in peace
I don't know why they wanna call me up every Easter Sunday to the altar
Maybe the music I am doin' is never gospel, sinner is what they call ya
I know we look a little strange and we the gang my lane is what I offer
3 dimensional altar with a ego on top of the rock of Gibraltar
I see-e, it's not the way the bible people want me to be-e
Flippin' the fire for the family focused and free-e
Listen to me-e doing it for TV-e
With the rebel yell, came out of my shell
Preacher said tell your people let go of your coat-tail
With a tremendous fail he never to say my livin' is hell
But even worse said I lead my people to Hell's Bells
Lookin' at me just like my mother and father would breed creatures
Not an evil bone in my body and never known to be naughty in my seeds either
Simple and plain like a cheese pizza
I don't know prayin' on my knees keep us from heat seekers
Lovin' the bleed feature while the people tell me that I need Jesus!
Talk about, judgement
Speakin' to me with the people I'm leadin' 'em underway
And you read me and see me easy to be shunned away
But you got it all wrong
You seem to tell me I need Jesus! (oh, Jesus! Jesus!)
Every day they wanna condemn me
None of 'em even know me
Anyone ever that sinned cast the Stone out
I'm stoned, let's talk about it
I'm askin'
What's happening?
Boy, 'cause they bashing me
Bangin' the bible, butcher boy don't bother with blasphemy
Call 'em a crazy critic comin' causin catastrophes
Aimin' at Aaron a lot of ammo and an angel actually
Ah mane, Amen
You people let the steeples speak in evil and the neezle playing God hymn
My mother was a christian but I used to go with the wicked for the stick and what's the problem
Questioning the K.O.D.'s grim, anybody talkin' hella crazy I'm bout to jaw them
You'll be up on a cross whenever you step to me so take precautions
Y'all false actors, callin' me a demon when I talk backwards siht pot
Tecca Nina gonna be sought after this drop by the people that go toss rappers hip hop
So you thinking you religious?
When you condemn another man you never lead us
Telling me what's under me is gonna heat us
Never believe ya cause really you need Jesus
Leave us
Talk about, judgement
Speakin' to me with the people I'm leadin' 'em underway
And you read mesee me easy to be shunned away
But you got it all wrong
Let's talk about it
Mama never really talked about God
All that I was ever taught was I'm odd
Heard he knew bout every thought that I hide
Dirty mind I'd see a cross and I'd hide
Lost without God, salty bout that
But I was captivated by the bosses outside
I plotted every way to getting draws by my squad
Ask round why every man goes bad
Happens to pass down like second hand clothes man
Salvage a blouse gown and manicured toes had
Half of us ground bound for hell and lord knows
Need a savior they say slain for your behavior
Raised in three days grace be what he gave ya
The sun that'll make ya want to gravitate ta

Praise god my brother
Forgive me father right now
As I'm askin great blessing in favor right now for this man of God
Lord, you know the direction that your taking his life holy spirit Lord and you have a covern over his life
Continue to bless him Lord
Let him know that his best is yet to come
And Lord, let him know when the wickedness of his enemies try to destroy him,
To bring him down all he has to do is call on you
Now Lord, come bring favor into his life
Favor into his music Lord
Let him know that his best is yet to come
Aslong as he can seize to put you first
(Tech N9ne) Verse 1
Drama, use to be my middle name
With ecstasy, sex and technically set me for a little fame
It gets to me, when the people I used to know switch and change
Regretfully, I'm gonna say I don't wanna see none of 'em again
They stressin' me, when they think 'cause of my absence I'm playin' games
When really I just work in strain to let everybody else feel my pain
And respectfully, I gotta say buzz off you and Tech Nina thangs in jeopardy
'Cause I need angels around me they should cling?
But you never be strange?
I feel this deep in my vein
Like Leprosy, you attackin' my nerves and mess with my brain
It's vexin' me, ain't a angel inside you distrustin' vain is your recipe
To complain is necessity, you're to blame so I reckon we,
No longer be straight, that's why I never came
When you beckoned me, I need peace in my life
But with you I need gangs and weaponry, I'm too busy to have these lousy lames
To come question me, man I really do need more angels blessing me
(Chorus - Irv Da Phenom)
You see we've all done our dirt
God knows that I have and I know I can't take that back
But I can say today I'm makin' a change
Ima leave the drama in my past
So if you try to bring me down
Don't you ever come around
I got no space in my life for negative
I said I need, I need more angels around me
(Tech N9ne) Verse 2
Need somebody to bring me a brighter day, not somebody that when I see 'em comin' I gotta hide away,
Like these losers leavin' me messages, they gon' try to say
I went Hollywood when I don't answer so you know I push delete right away
I need the the drama gone like I'm at my mama home, yo' persona's piranha
Beyond the haters ?try mah home? So if you wanna get honest you get the Llama chrome
I know that you hear me even though I'm speakin' monotone, That's to the demons
Whos callin leavin' me death threats, Been a couple of years and my spirit ain't even left yet
Yellin' that when I come to yo' town I'm liable to get wet, Tech set, may be angels but dump you can bet that
We don't need evil seeds makin' us get dummy, wanna breathe, the way to succeed, get from me
Devil breathe, ain't no need for we to get chummy, Deny ya creed and proceed to get money
(Chorus- Irv Da Phenom)
(Tech N9ne-Verse 3)
Need sun rays, not a dark cloud, that's why there still lookin' for me like where art though?
Oh brother, they so cluttered and hearts foul, ain't never return there call and they bout to start now
Need angel wings not gargoyle, you bring that beef to me get ready to get charbroiled
I treated them so nice in the past, this people are spoiled, reject them demons and get 'em all off of our soil
And when the smoke clears, and when the smoke clears, and euretina, who cleaned it up
You got to give it up to slegna, the black boots and red strings come to bless ya, less ya mess mesh
And threats ?best ya exodus yes that's us, but my angle, is to break loose of these webs that's so tangled
Such a shame ya name remains painful, so change ya games, 'cause we were stained but became angels
(Chorus-Irv Da phenom)
(Closing prayer Brother KT)
Now Lord, guide and keep him, Lord give him strength and favor, In Jesus name I pray, Amen,

218,News With Mark Alford 1 (Skit),2013,Something Else (2013),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"I'm Mark Alford with breaking news this hour out of Pleasant Hill, Missouri, where we're getting reports of a meteorite hitting today in an open field there. Now the impact can be felt as far away as downtown Kansas City with tremors felt in high rise office buildings.
The eyewitness reports are just now coming into the news room. NOAA, or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, does have an office there in Pleasant Hill. Residents of Pleasant Hill definitely heard and felt the strike and now they wanna know: how could this happen?
On what would normally be a bright and sunny day here in Kansas City, a fog of some sort is now starting to roll north from pleasant hill through Lee Summit, and now approaching the downtown loop. We're getting a good view of it now from our tower cam if you can check it out. In fact, I've never seen anything like this before, it's eerie. Something- something like you'd see in the dust bowl days. Except, it's not dust, it's a mist of some kind. The skies have turned burgundy."
219,News With Mark Alford 2 (Skit),2013,Something Else (2013),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"We now have some developing news to tell you this hour about apparent mass vandalism in Kansas City. Police say it looks like the vandals are targeting local school buildings. Now traditionally, vandals use spray paint, as you know, to tag property. In these cases, the letters: E.B.A.H. appear to be burned into the sides of multiple Kansas City school buildings.
Police say it happened some time over night and police say the only lead they really have right now points to some sort of connection with Kansas City based rap artist: Tech N9ne. Maybe a fan? You might remember Tech N9ne released a recording back in September of 2012 with that same title that was now found burned into the schools: E.B.A.H."
220,News With Mark Alford 3 (Skit),2013,Something Else (2013),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Ever since the meteor strike earlier this week, the burgundy mister fog has been spreading throughout the metro. Since then, there had been numerous reports of strange, but positive, side effects. Including a dramatic decrease in crime.
Kansas City Police are stunned. This week, they have responded to ZERO emergency calls. Kansas City School Officials are also reporting some dramatic changes since the burgundy skies overtook the city. Student attendance and test scores are BOTH up significantly.
School administrators as well as the police chiefs say if this dramatic change is a result of our new burgundy skies, then they certainly hope the burgundy mist will keep spreading for the good of man-kind.
They say their hope is that this, cold harsh earth, will eventually become a better place for us all to live.

Captivated by my pain, terribly I'm going insane
I can't relay, I can't do nothing
Think I oughta be killing something
Someone's gon' take me away
To the prison or the grave
Either way they want me a slave
Please understand and hear me today
Not the man you thought I was
Coulda stopped this with your love
Big I am, give a damn, in your window here I am
Label a badsy from the start
I'm the man without a heart
So maybe I'm me, drinking juice
Cipher wrong and you will lose
You're the problem, I'm the answer
When I'm done, you beg for cancer
'Cause I don't fuck around
I was born in the ground
Now it's time for me to roll
Your head up in to a bowl
Your nightmare's here, can I leave?
So much murder up my sleeve
I bring the pain, I bring the sickness
Never learn to give forgiveness
I will pay, but not today
On the surf you will not stay
To the Lord or to the Devil
That is not my decision
When you're dead you cannot ask to be forgiven
[Chorus] 
How much further can night goes?
See the child from the darkness
Think they can hear but they don't know
I can't see from the shadows
I'm sure to see in the night scene
At midnight, sleep again
Can't go away from this dream
These nightmares where I stay
[Verse 2] 
I stay in the nightmare, cause that's I'm welcome
Do I get out? No never, even seldom
The Devil hates me, but he loves what I do
Until the day I say, ""yo the joke's on you""
Stuck in a pit with the fire and the demons
I can't get out and I can't stop screaming
Wish to God it was just another dream
I'ma surely be sicker than a seed
Infinite sadness I am losing my wife
Intimite gladness I am losing my life
All I wanna do is break through the level
All I wanna do is escape from the Devil
Torture on the corner, edge of persecution
How can I be the problem, when there is no solution?
Eluded by the ways of all that I do
He's not coming for me, bitch, he's coming for you!
[Chorus] 
How much further can night goes?
See the child from the darkness
Think they can hear but they don't know
I can't see from the shadows
I'm sure to see in the night scene
At midnight, sleep again
Can't go away from this dream
These nightmares where I stay
[Verse 3] 
Stuck in a rud like, what the fuck I give a shit
Now I know the answer why the world's on my dick
I gotta do this now and I gotta do this right
Now is the time to end my fucking life
I don't think it's crazy, I don't think it's nuts
I just want the wall to taste my fucking blood
I can't get it back, I can't do it over
Maybe I should do it when I become sober
I have a plan that you don't understand
That if I jump a cliff I know that I will land
How much further can I possibly go
When the world stops, no one really knows
Send me through Hell I will bring five back
We will have an army ready to attack
The pain comes after, the click and the clack
Now I got my brain rolling down my back
[Chorus] 
How much further can night goes?
See the child from the darkness
Think they can hear but they don't know
I can't see from the shadows
I'm sure to see in the night scene
At midnight, sleep again
Can't go away from this dream

And she play it out like exposé, tryin' to get quality time like, ""Let's crochet.""
Got me thinkin' of chinnin' some underhanded women but I never hit a woman so I'mma fetch Solé
And then you whine sayin', ""That's no k."" (Heh Heh Heh)
Sayin' if you got to hand out, stop ya damn mouth
Ain't none of my fault you get low pay
So needy (Ha), I'm on ace of spades and you (?Jay Roje?)
They wanna try and get whatever you got
Wanna wear the chain and watch, I'ma say, ""No K.""
No K, that's what I say when I don't really wanna
Say that it's all right but it's all right (No, no, no)
No K, that's what I tell you when I ain't just trynna
Talk to you all night
(No-oh) Can't get my money
(No-oh) That's not okay
(No-oh) And I'm one hunnit
(No-oh) So I'ma tell you that's no K
No K
No K
She my bitch but I ain't finna give her her none of my pay
No way, no how, no what?
Bitch, I don't give a motherfuck
It's paper over pussy, P-O-P
Celebrity get everything for free
If you can't swim, you gon' drown
Throw a bitch up in the air and break her 'fore she hit the ground
No K No K, No K No K
This ain't Broadway, no play
From the track, from the cage, from the swim, from the mud
Words hella hate, no love
No suckers allowed in my cap and hell no, you can't hit my weed you tramp
Wanna stand on the stage? No K, you can't
Ride on my bus? No K, you can't
Why you always got ya hand out? All you do is pout like a woman
Grown man, act like niggas owe you somethin'
Habitual liar, always lyin' for nothin'
Start a lot of shit and be the first one runnin'
No K, prolly showin' hella niggas in the game
Like Jose, AK, AK-47 to a nigga brain
Get him out the way
No K, that's what I say when I don't really wanna
Say that it's all right but it's all right (No, no, no)
No K, that's what I tell you when I ain't just trynna
Talk to you all night
(No-oh) Can't get my money
(No-oh) That's not okay

Still not amazed, at what you see before you
I can't go, I can't stay
Ooh, do tie, if we walk away
Don't you, don't you want somebody to love you?
Won't you, won't you need somebody to love?
Don't even touch much
Don't even talk to me
Baby, free yourself
'Cause you're not the one for me
And it ain't no turning back
Ain't no more, me and you
Me and you
Me and you
See, I don't love you (Yes I do)
You don't love me (You do too)
We can't hardly get along, with the clothes on
Everything I say is wrong, listen
Hot in the kitchen; I can't take it
All dem lil' folks thought we'd make it
Ain't nothing left for me to do
Cut loose from me to you
Don't even touch much
Don't even talk to me
Baby, free yourself
'Cause you're not the one for me
And it ain't no turning back
Ain't no more, me and you
Me and you
Me and you
(Verse: Tech N9ne)
I think we should stop...
Because I'm callin you from the studio askin' ""You wanna see me or not? ""
Being my beezy ain't easy, she won't see me a lot
So when you creepin', deceiving, please believe me I'm hot
Why do I have to feel like I'm begging you-
To be with me, puttin' me through this hell when I'm showin' you what Heaven do?
After all of these years, I never knew
You would back off and slack off when I had to move and stop your monthly revenue
Only wanted to love you but money seemed to be bigger
That's worse than us having sex, and you white, and calling me ""nigger""
It's over baby, hope you get this message that I deliver
It never was about loving, it was what I could give her
It's crazy, crazy, (crazy)
I didn't hear from you in a year and found out you had somebody else's baby
No more me and you girl, I had to go
Hit the do', now the only time you see me is at my show
Don't even touch much
Don't even talk to me
Baby, free yourself
'Cause you're not the one for me
And it ain't no turning back
Ain't no more, me and you
Me and you
Me and you"

When I drop this Bou Lou drink, it'll put me up in billions

How ya didn't know we had the green when I'm all up in yo' magazine?
So focused on the flow, fo' fifth, yo' bitch throw shit, that's flattering
We ain't like you others, we got a very sick disease
And, if you get this bug, it may result in making cheese
Made a lot of Technicians, gettin' mo' is the next mission
We got the colleges, the suburbs and the 'jects trippin'

Put-put a chastity belt on yo' spouses (Ugh-huh!)

Y'all saying the same thing, mainstream in trouble now

Strange, so you know I make cake now
Want to know where's the house by the lake down?
I bought the car, it was the model and I'm make now
I kick back, my feet up, cramp down and re-up
Talk shit and I talk shit, let's pop shit, nigga, G up

Hit it right then I'm out, no diggity no doubt

We gotta make that group
We gotta jet, seven forty seven style
Oh shit, eleven hundred mo' miles
(Verse 4 - Tech N9ne)
L.A. two-way my on
The chronic up in L.A. we stayed high gone
Wake up show flows see hoes on the 405
Already hell alive when I arrive
Midwest style no Cristal just Caribou Lou
Feel like I'm an alien like Mr. Sulu a new crew but who?
Them road dog niggas from Mizzizy
We rollin' on Sunset mobbin' like we on prospect dizzy
What's the real dough, we got that real flow
You other busters coming fake like a dildo
And if you wanna try a nigga from the misery get with me
And me show you what the Tecca Nina kill fo'
I'm out for stacks baby, creating plaques baby
After I'm making the rellish we can hit the sack maybe
Billboard live, rockin' hella heads at the Roxy
I'm off and can't a motherfucker stop me I'm off nigga
[Hook - Tech N9ne & (Don Juan)] (2x)
On our way to Cali
All we want is the palm trees a pretty bitch (and become rich)
Rogue dogs we come to bring the fury (make it dash to L.A.)
Turn Cali to Missouri
(Outro - Tech N9ne & (Don Juan))
(Yeah, ey, call the nigga Don and tell that nigga to get the van ready we 'bout to roll to Cali)
We got everything, hey just make sure we got everything you know?
(Yeah that's right I got the ?)
Call the nigga Q and tell 'em uh- we arrive uuh- five o'clock memorial day man)
(That's right that's right ey)
Tell the nigga to have some biancs ready for us
(Tell the nigga to have the motherfucking 151 ready 'cause we got plenty of Caribou Lou ready for bitches in the jacuzzi)
And play some questions with you hoes hahahaha

And luckily 'cause of your past you can have someone assist ya
I was raised a cool brotha, but these mothafuckas went and summoned a nigga!
I swore to never let a man's hands take me to my grave, nigga
With my fortune I'ma get to torchin' like Orkin I spray, nigga
I know they dyin' to get it with the 9
That's fine they wanna make a nigga do the whoop
So I'm gonna take the carbine and put it to ya mind
It's going through you, not around you like a hula hoop
Put that on the Bible?
If you fuckin' with Tech get the rifles
Totally tripping tryna take my title
Lift you right up in the sky with the Eiffel
If you psycho
You can do this
If he chooses
To be foolish
The gun never loses
Never give you the deuces
Nigga, this is Su'Wu biz, ah!
Let me calm my nerves
I'ma simply put this on the word

If you know, like I know, then you know, true
And nigga make songs, but they really don't do
What they say, got gun but they really won't shoot
He afraid.  I lay a nigga down right now
Face to the concrete, nose to the ground
Do him in the street 'fore his prayers hit the cloud
And the flash and a bang, it is rarely allowed
But a whole body down, and a hole in the ground
Dig one for the niggas who be holdin' ya down
Better know I got rounds, and they will go around
It's enough
Eat a bullet from the four-pound if ya tough
And then let the choppa spray ya down and get up
Ya pull that off, I'll believe ya ain't soft
Otherwise, nigga you just soft as all them other guys
I kill you dead, and I put that on my mother' eyes
Don't listen to these niggas, they just kick a bunch of lies
How they got a bunch of gun?  Shot 'em all a bunch of times.
I really do believe Tech got a bunch of 9s
Before they gave my nigga Meech a bunch of time
I really know my nigga Young had a bunch of pie
For the low, all my niggas had it for the high
So you believe them niggas out there talkin' bout they BMF?
They should be them niggas, none of mine
I know Young got it bout what he rap bout
I really pulled Meek Millz out the trap house
Just like I seen Doe B with a OZ
Turn around, two weeks, had a whole ki
Just 'cause I said as a joke, that the dope game dead

Nobody is looking at me anyway
Nobody is looking at me anyway
Yo
Yo
I know that I'm hardcore
Know how to start wars
Know how to scar yours in a fist fight
Cause toughness is our floor
Warriors that bar nor
But this one is far tore up on this night
Some people show it and then
Some people hide it
But other people they do it whenever they get excited but me
I can't even do it when the wrongs on mine
I'm saying I've been trying to do it for a long long time
I get jealous when I see people do it and it's like fluid
I'm thinking
How can they swallow that when I can't even chew it
I guess God seen it fit to label me the consoler
Bestowed upon a broken show and forever be the shoulder
My mission is plain to see
Its freaking insanity
I'm wishing the pain in me would just leave me be why can't it be
Simple cause on the real
This one could die
So I'm asking God
Before I go
Just give me one good cry
If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it's a lonely road
So I sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Why I got to be the one to cheer up
People till they clear up
When I sneeze I tear up
And then I go look in a mirror
So I can see how it looks
When I really wanna know how it feels
When I'm hella down I try to push
No matter how hard no water spills for real
My patience is soon to go
Waiting for the balloon to blow
I'm thinking back to when I used to go to funerals
No matter how close we were
On the inside it ached ""wow""
Others be losing it
I'm just wishing I could break down
And I been through a lot of them
And there's not a one
That went on and got it done
No moisture that even try even to come
And this ain't no chump thing, because I've had enough pain
Tears should be run-in like mustangs
Man it must rain
Been trying for years
But the crying been inside
Nina been so serious there ain't no lying in his eyes
Makes me so furious
When I look and I'm in genocide
Please let me break down with the pain I felt when Brian Dennis died
One time...
If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it's a lonely road
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
Nobody's looking at me anyway
I look at actors and crying
It's as easy as fondue
But what do you do when extreme hurt is upon you
Real life ain't no movie homie
And this ain't John Woo
But I almost lost it on the ending of Jon Q
And I almost lost it when Jennifer Hudson blew
But I'm still waiting for that real emotion to come through
Then maybe I could get a cry God
Maybe one, two?
Been red for life for the first time ever me want blue
Give me the blues
Sometimes I turn on the news and I
Look at all these feuds
Then I try to make them ooze
(Don't cry, no teardrops from your eye
Poerty's music oh my, almost made me tear up about thinking about my children, no lie)
Maybe I'm black hearted
You thinking damn he shady
Saying man he crazy
For the way I abandon me lady
One day she can repay me
Yes that woman can betray me
Then I'll probably cry if not than I do it if I win me a Grammy maybe
If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it's a lonely road
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
Nobody's looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
Nobody's looking at me anyway"

So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we over it, over it

I'm just
Gonna make it difficult for other rappers to get their rhymes up

Stop you can do it all day
But you're not gonna pop
Me the crew and all lay
In the box you were topping the charts
Look at the people not even jockin' your art

Cause everybody that really buys rap
Don't wanna listen to any guys yap

But I was taught to not be no punk
And don't pull no punches my hood say
Since y'all actin' like Biancas and Be-

Your last album was everywhere

This is so, so crazy...
This long journey...
Look at all the love you gave me
You gave me the strength...
To keep on moving forward
Pushing me past the stars...
Now the light I'm running toward...
(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
At the bottom of the barrel, I was like the rotten apple
And I never graduated, no gown, no cap and a tassel
But I stowed my education, now I got my teachers baffled
Wonder why I feel the terror of number one independent
God picked my name in the raffle
I was dealt a bad hand, wasn't gonna amount to nothing
Thank god that I had fans, keyboards, mics an percussion
'Cause with that yo I elevated, now I'm just celebrated
Whenever tecca nina hit the public
Taking so many pictures, signing my autograph
Leaving messages on your voice mails and I love it
With all this new success I can't believe this love level
Specially when they thought that I was devil
A painted up psycho brotha who loves metal
The response is overwhelming, for the love, can't thank you enough
Dedicated to all the people who got me out of hell
Y'all saved my life and stuff
(Hook: Jay Da 3rd & (Tech N9ne))
I opened up my heart, showed you what I had inside
An ocean full of truth, too deep for the lies
Ya made it to the pain, had to swim through the pride
There's nothing else I need to survive
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, so, so!)
So overwhelming!(So, so, so)
(Yeah, ay, it kept me alive yeah!)
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, it's so, so!)
So overwhelming!(So, so, so)
(Yeah, it kept me alive yeah, yeah, come on!)
(Verse 2: Tech N9ne)
Back in the days I went through visions, in my head, dreams that you'd listen
But my wonderful fans they came, and made it all come to fruition
Sometimes with the females I'll straight show my gratitude through kissin'
On the cheek, for the youngsters, foreheads, or a legal pound for the fella's crew?
Way back then I was bitter, was unused my music is litter, so mad and I'm mad I got jitters
Didn't consider that in a second I would be bigger, the label found that I was a hard hitter
I'd give'r shit was delivered hella hard from a spitter, gritter
Recognizing all the humongous love I'd get on facebook and positive messages on twitter
This is how I tell you thank you, to all of my fans I thank you
And you can tell all those suckaz that hate on the Nina they just upset that they ain't you
'Cause they favorite artist is lame, and neglects his fans, he does do
But your favorite artist goes out of his way to show you that he loves you
(Hook: Jay Da 3rd & (Tech N9ne))
I opened up my heart, showed you what I had inside
An ocean full of truth, too deep for the lies
Ya made it to the pain, had to swim through the pride

(Yeah, your love is so, so, so!)

So overwhelming!(So, so, so)

(Verse 3: Tech N9ne)
So here's to all of my fans, your making my dreams come true
You helped me create this land, by believing that this one knew
That one is N9ne, you brung his time to everyone and rhymed
All though some is blind you brung his lines to the sun and shined
Technician hunts, keeping my every condition pumped
Giving you what your suspicion wants, waking up these hissing punks
To the early strange fans, thank you for feeling my pain man
But for the newbies I'm so so glad that you made it, welcome to strangeland
The tattoos, the tears, the gratitude, the years
My lifes my debt through sound, thank you 'cause Tech you found
Just know that I'm thankful and I will never ever let you down
(Hook: Jay Da 3rd & (Tech N9ne))

I'll crack you open
Like the youngest male Kennedy.
Got the whole planet
Rocking off the low blows

And poke hoes
That's suppose to be yours
Seeing my haters
In the dark alley
Tormented by mine
Dodging the TECH N9NE
Now here's the message
Liberate me
Chocolata tay
Imma rock
Not play
Do the fuck what I say
Throw your souls in the air
Like this
Flash your bar codes
While I stick 'em
With another hit
Up out of abyss
The TECH N9NE N9na
Out to find vaginas
Just a player
Clubbing it
Rubbing it
Loving that
Creamer streamer
Might seem a little extreme
My thing
When I flips
I gots to make sure that it's hot
Make the whole planet rock

Down south biancs
Make the planet rock

Get up on it

Can I bone it
Cause all we want to do
Is get drunk
Get blowed
Spit shit
Spark blunts
And fuck hoes
We're quick to beat a buster down bad
MidWest Side put me in the soundlab
Now I'm ton niviganmad
I flipped it backwards
For you flow snatchers
Blast y'all
In the ass
N9na playing fast ball
Crash all
Glass jaws
Mad y'all
Cause last call
I was in the back
Of the club
Banging the hell
Outta this bad broad
On my planet
We take no haters for granted
They crisscross
Ten seconds till lift off
Be soaked in pistol grip sauce
Ripped off
The techniques complete heat
Retreat six feet
Under six feet

Freaks tweak
Never let the beast seep

Mmmmmm Uuuurr no I can't do it (can't do it, can't do it)
Fuck this
Click Click
I gotta, I wanna
My pain killer's in my dresser
Right next to my rester
What insane brain would agree to this gesture
Too unjest less stress left with no extra
You's a mess, true depressed steps can infect ya
I'm a product of some shit gone wrong
Even though I speak to many with a hit song tone
Even though I'm famous and I'm givin' chicks long dong
Man I feel like a copper top just a sick stone drone
One flew over the cuckoos nest
And he cashed some buku checks
But he was not mentally stable the crew new tech
As a phenomenon but karma wanna noose dude's necks
Designer of death get to choose who's next
Is it real to you but if you got evil your kind to come and steal a few
Condemn souls 'cause of what the old pain killer do
Keep having these dreams of my taking my nine milli
Who can help me execute this desire to pop a pill or two
You can't give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpess and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D.
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers, pain killer
My pain comes from me being a fuck up
With strange music we really, we lucked up
Cause being a lost soul got my bucks up
Even though my cerebral cortex and spirit needed a touch up
Everybody around me hurtin' and shit
Well everybody on TV kickin it reject jerkin and shit
I'll be the one on stage and studios stressed out workin' and spit
This shit to the people and I know that I gotta alot of evil lurkin in quick
Women want me want me
So they flaunt thee monkey
Even doin' sex sometimes, a heap of stress still wants to haunt me
When I grab the yalk she couldn't talk and it was no humpty dumpty
Even though I'm sick in the head we kick it like a donkey don't we
My apology to anyone labeled a victim
And I'm losin' my mind I just picked up the nine and I gripped 'em
And I put it off in that direction like I was the kiss one
I always think of the day when I'm able to pull back and I click em
You can't give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpless and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D.
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers, pain killers
No meds for me
Just left for me
Any light inside my head is just to dead to see
Any kind of way out of this hole can I
Pull this darkness outta this soul
Lotta people really wanna know how it's so
Cause a lot of motherfuckers have been down this globe
And I'm one of them
You can see it on the television, everybody trippin' and it's a ton of em
Straight feelin' that pain go insane
Then bang and it ain't no none of em
Many ways to end these days
When the darkness really wanna shun the sun
Ten million ways to die when you constantly cry and the gun is one
You can't give me medical attention to ease my pain
(Tired of getting my shit like this man, I'm done with this fucking music man)
Sometimes I feel helpless and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers, pain killers"

And when they bled on me I was giddy and never squeamish.
Bad as a demon I cannot get rid of her I really rely on the feelin' of the sex an the red of a woman.
Can I take a bite of your cerebellum I think it'll really get me up if I could be suckin your seratonin.
Id rather just die than inflict any pain on somebody who truly put trusted me.
Better yet I just make her the suffer who taught me mocked me 'n' fucked with me.
Maybe get up in the club and shoot it up and makem panic at the disco... (backwards)

But you look so, good to me...
(Tech N9ne)
Shut Up, take off your clothes
(Tech N9ne: Verse 1)
Lay down on the mother fucking bed, like I said
I'm a different kind of nigga, like to spread bloody red
From banging the thing I'm a tame when you shed naughty legs
I'm geeking
Cause you peaking with my head
Leave you dead and leaking
I'm a killer, but instead of a machete
I got my dick, I'm a drill her
Then I'm a hit her with the steady
A proper check up speedy
Like Andretti hit the crevi
A lot to pick up, Betty gotta be ready for the yeti
To eat, my kind of meat, find mine to feat
But climb N9ne the beast, it's my time to feast
Einstein N9ne slime the sheets
I'm tryna design prime dine swine the beast
She whine the least
Rewind the beat cause T9 he grind the freaks
Putting your motherfucking feline to sleep
Cannibalistic with her I'm hoping she don't mind the teeth
You invited me in
Gimme the Henny, lemon and sprite and the night'll begin
You ignited me when you stated you sighted me when
I was painted up so you came on up and kited my sin
Till the morning light, it was on tonight
You met a DK-N to fucking bone you right
Clones'll roam you might, be surprised with the vibe
But I'm leaving paint on your pillow meaning I was inside
I ain't finna steal your fate
My aim is to kill your hate
We gone drank till you can't feel your face
Then I'm leaving paint on your pillowcase
(Verse 2: Aqualeo)
I'm smoking a lot, I failed a nigger when I told her where she was by my motherfucker face pine
'Cause bitch, it don't matter what you think
When it drain, it will be your time and you'll say ice hank
A little bit and a little more, is a little more liquor to get the whore
Fuck you because I do it with the leather floor
Later you will feel real stupid like a play prank
'Cause I know about the hold that was in her
Know she a sinner, oh, no beginner
Hold her ass low and go for the dinner
Tell that ho no, 'cause my heart cold like winter
Yes, so, 'cause she's a freak, it ain't me
Walking on the streets just getting me
One in four creeps just get me, so I told her corner for, eating my dick is a privilege
Take her down, take her, take her, take her down
But if I take her down, then a nigger will never get the crown
But if I get your picture will I own her lick her down
Then a lick her down will never be a nigger down
And her beating the sack is right, so the next time she'll be in the time and place
Some that she can't escape, but I can, even with a trace
I ain't finished with your thing
I ain't here to kill your head
We can drain until we kill your vein
And leave the paint on your pillowcase
Paint on your pillowcase, paint on your pillowcase
We can drain till you can't feel your vein
And leave the paint on your pillowcase
(Verse 3: Aqualeo)
The sin that brought us all here
The one we love the most, but yet is the one we all fear
So time's sadistic, it gets mystic and the trends are twisted
Bodies in exquisite positions, that's so illicit
Illegal to the exhibits, solicit, yet we exist
In a thrill and all sorts of feeling we get, that's so implicit
Why people risking their life, depinction husband and wife
To get closer to the true wise that brings us eternal life
The paint left on your pillow is the same from off the face
The one you see in your dreams when you're taking below the waist
The devil was giving horns, but the nature from which was born
Every person that's ever lived so get praise to the god of porn"

Knock it out the frame, mane
Caught a couple mo' dame-dames
Than my homies with the cane came
Now we got a Strange thang
Yeah... y'all do, I don't (what's that, Tech?)
Turn down something I won't
I'm a... grinch when I'm yearning it
Get so hot up in the spot, I think I'm partying at Burning Man
I deal with the real, when I feel
But tonight I'm takin' Bou Lou to the grill
I'll be damned, if it ain't a day, I kick it and can't obey
When life is heavy we uh... party the pain away
(Tech N9ne)
I be off in Australia
Where the ladies really didgeridoo it if they smell ya
Aboriginal's will tell ya
That they rollin' hella deep, and if you trippin' it's a failure
When I'm off in California
Molly got me so dehydrated, smell ammonia
I be feelin' like a donor
Not blood, but the other stuff
Cause the women bone ya
When the real life's on my case
A woman waits, to sit on my face
In Missouri, it's all on my state
When I'm home, yes I keep a heapin' on my plate
I'm in a dark party, with a red light
'Bout to be another ""take it to the head"" night
Whether you're drinkin', or you're smokin', or the med type

If I'm off up in your city, come and party with the Milla
20 shots of tequila
This'll make a little money so I'm gonna pay the billa

Get your woman, take her picture with me 'cause I'm hella mello
If you're tough and wanna yell though
She'll be leavin' with the crew
And I'mma stick her like some velcro
We the party people, night and day (what)
Livin' crazy is the only way, got a...
Party persona, fuck the pain and come and kick it

If you you see thunda
From a gun this is somethin' that'll get the heat on ya
When she's under the sheets on the beautiful sleep numba
Don't no wake an yappin when she's in a deep slumba
If we share secret
And the scare, was equal to one of us gettin' the chair do you swear to keep it (YES)
Meaning that under heat you wouldn't nare leak it
SO when your woman's in you're presence don't you dare speak it
Pillow talkin' get you caught up an brought up on charges
Shot up a lot and departed, it's nothin' short of retarded
'Cause when you say stuff
And then you an your woman break up
You funkin because your mouth wouldn't stay shut
How could you spread that?
Can't believe you said that
Puttin' my life in jeapordy definetely it'll make the feds tap-Bed trap
What you tell your lady can make you take a dead nap
Fluff up your pillow an lay your head back
YOU
Be pillow talkin'
You
Don't be pillow talkin' (Don't say nothin')
YOU
Be pillow talkin'
You
Don't be pillow talkin'
(Verse 2) Scarface
My advice for niggas is this
You can never trust no chick
It don't matter how silky the hoe can stroke yo dick
It don't matter how slimy the pussy hole gone get
If a nigga talks to these bitches these hoes gone snitch
(SHiiit) I used to fuck this bitch
Had a husband with dope money an I had his snow bunny
Climbin the bed post
Feedin her dog meat
In love with the nine inch, so she steady calls me
Tells me she's leavin', I know the reason
She know where the guns at, the lock box keys an
The floor safe combo
But this here one ho, was this dudes bad news
Knock on the front door
A man in a police suit, a girl with a black tooth (??)
Get to the money she saw him countin' in the back room
But it doesn't end hear, the man with the cop suit
Shoots at the bitch once, pops an drops dude
(Verse 3) Tech N9ne
I can tell you what the problem is
People try to be monogomous
Tell his woman a lot of shit
An he thinkiin he got a bottom bitch
Stop with the sentimental talks at night if you're pillow talkin' then you oughtta quit
When the heat comes with the quickness, lookin' for the witness man yo broad is it
How you wanna spit it?
I don't really get it
Givin' your woman the power to speak in a minute
Speakin' about a brotha wanna cover ya motha
With the nina but you the only one know I really did it
When it come back then you feel low
Because everyone know you ain't real though
Cause them beans you spillin
You known for squealin an all you needed was a pillow
I shoulda did the dirt, all by my lonely
Like Trech say
But the company that you keep end up bein phony, so the tech spray
Never let no chick I hit get with that homie
Cause the next day, she seein right through me
Got them lenses on me, like an X-Ray
An I'm fed up with these rappers
Who be yappin to these groupies
They flash them a little coochy
Then you blab an try to reduce me
And it always come back to me
So when I come through strapped with an uzi
It ain't like ""Damn why'd he shoot me?""
Usin' the nueve name too loosely"

Put a couple of hands of grease in my hair
Into my eyebrows and now I'm tight
I want to be with a women and just this one
But the taste of blood is still on my tongue
If I could just eat food
Instead of her D boobs
I want this one alive when the morning comes!
I just want to be a normal boy
Just want to be a normal boy
If I could be good and just
Keep the women off my tongue
She can be my number one...
Lady
Oh please oh please oh please
Just give me just one more clit
One more tit
One more bitch
What is it gonna do to get me fixed
'Cause I gotta have this one in my mix
She's so beautiful I would slit
Both my wrists
If she splits
When she finds out that I'm so sick
I eat women
I really eat women
They're really delicious
I gotta be normal so I can make her the Mrs.
I got a date with her so I can tell her my wishes
Even though I'm a beast but she don't know that I'm vicious
So I meet her at her place and she's so sweet
Made me dinner but really want her meat
From her cheek
Maybe her feet
I'm tryna be discrete
But I really want to eat her out completely
Teach me
To keep it away from her
The eating and tape on her
The chewing away fingers
Once she feeds me I'm loving me tasting her
Can I just have a normal night
I just want to be the man to live a normal life
Normal wife
Keep her in the formal white
But the psycho creature with the horn will bite
It's almost sun-up now
I'm getting done up wow
Fellatio
But I found out she was insatiable
She wanted me to do her too
Don't want to see me through her view
'Cause I got on my knees

I wanna couple of dem para-dises
Gimme two of dem sum a dem beetches
That's the Hennesy at the top
That's fifty dollars a shot
Too much will make you pop to pieces
'Cause when I party yes I drink to sin
Gimme drunk enough I'll probably bink a friend
Rumble in my belly
Head is in the toilet
I will never ever get drunk again
I'm talkin' 'bout them other cats
Drinkin' a little boo and then they had enough of that
Dark is what I do can never get enough yak
But when I do what I do while they mixin em
What I gotta ask
Sane lookin' man gon make me three
Cups of delicious K.C. Tea
That's Hennesy, Sprite and lemon
If you got better than that you gotta make me see
Off in the club fucked up
And I got all of my bucks up
Twenty women at the bar right next to me
Every one of them just lucked up
Saturday night Voodoo Loungin it
Cause P & L club's got boo boo sounds in it
All twenty comin' with the crew who's down to hit
Till the break of dawn wit a new new poundin it
Last call
Ain't no such
Then we drinkin' one in my clutch
Keep the party goin'
I'm getting your lust up
Everybody we be comin' to lift your cups then

I'm theatre of the hood
When it's lights, cameras, faction
Niggas gon be niggas when it's fight satisfaction
I walk up to the bar smellin like the Kenneth Reaction
Niggas reactin like you must be out of his slacks
When I'm undressed I confess I act a foolery
A pocket full of duckettes
Buku bitches and jewelery
I'm buyin out the bar like my name was Anheusur Brewery
And hittin bush by the duece
Like Jesus created two of me
Haters they make me famous
So I'm deservin an Oscar
Walkin' by niggas notice my swagger's disturbin they posture
But I don't ever pranks bein gangsta got a steady aim
Cause the K will make them feel more hits than Teddy Pain
So I don't tease about the way I'm makin' cheese
I know you haties wanna cease and desist
But it will never ever happen
'Cause I'm definitely rapping
At the party wondering will I quit
I simply say

I'm the type of drinker with no mixers in my liquors
Crown Royal on the rocks serve it in your biggest pitcher
Rock the cocktail thinking Potluck too high to talk to women
Just wanna get 'em drunk shut 'em up and get up in em
She tipsy off six shots
She's feelin' my Rick Ross
She wanna lick a rapper and roll wit a big boss
Push it to the limit
Everyday's another party
Pineapple mali and Bacardi turnin' all the women naughty
Uh-Oh
I be drinkin' everyday like I'm on tour
And I love to get high like bon jour
Take another shot the shit's contagious
Like Nicolas Cage you live in Las Vegas
I'm sedated (?)
Aimlessly lookin' for faded hoes who wanna get naked
Cause bitch it's under rated
So pour me another drink
I want one
I'ma take it to the head till they all done
I can barely stand up let alone run
But the name of the game is to have fun
So take a shot with me little mama
I promise I don't bite like Jeffery Dahmer
I'm goin' to the top like Barack Obama
I'm a never slow it down like a comet

I'm like a walking drug

Want sex from a nigga like me
I can feel her nightly
Even make her fall off in love
Get away lost off in hugs
Stalkin blood for an awesome plug
This is addictive
Vicious and wicked slick talkin' stud
I take good gals
Recruit um, pollute um
Put X in they wood valve
To shoot um
They chewed um up and true enough
They would be poppin', droppin', pursuin us
Plus screwin the crew an such
A ruined slut livin' through a nut
That was then but now I see um
They be on the same shit
Brainless
Itchin to get that quick trip wanna be painless
I don't fuck with it no more that I can arrange it
I was like Dracula attackin her when I give her game
Hella vein language
It was they choice to trip
I kept her moist and slick
Now she's an annoying chick
I started avoiding Ms
Give her them toys and split
I polluted so many women with bad habits and drugs
I guess I'm poisonous

Silicon plastic oral injections
Is just big hips on my erection

Like to make 'em buy me clothes
By using my mouthpiece

Not to mention, these federal penitentiaries
Locking all my of niggas up giving them half a century
So the day they get out with Alzheimer's they won't remember me
And everything they did before 20 is faded memories
(Verse 2: Tech N9ne)
Hated enemies ready to finish me
Government wanna limit these men with G's
Spin it put them in a key, then it's me beginning this chemistry
I am tangled, cause living this got a man strangled
It's fandagled, hand me a plan from a damn angel
(Verse 3: Angel Davenport)
Angels in my city get it gritty, rioting off Henny
In clubs they act fast, packing, they gats got plenty
When you in my streets better open your fucking eyes
Niggas in front wanna take you down, in back wanna break your spine
(Verse 4: Game)
Stain inside broken glass
And to forget it all we grab a bitch and poke her fast
Walk her out holding ass
Anything for that Lambo, in years of holding cash
Spend it on a couple strippers and forget to hold the gas
(Verse 5: Tech N9ne)
Gas high, but it ain't like me, I'm past the sky
You ask us why we emotional and have to cry
Cause the cash is my way that I'm gonna last or die
But when they classify me as bad in the masses' eye
(Verse 6: Angel)
Dare you to go through all this sickness
Need a minute come to my senses
On block they pose, throw 'em to the dog
Pitbulls then they place all bets in
Often I cop, often I fight bitches
Launder they thoughts, launder them leave stitches
Street vicious micro missions
Still play the game with the end in a vision
Might
(Verse 7: Game)
Give a bum a holla, toss em' a couple dollas
Hit the window with them wipers, but forget your babies diapers
(Verse 8: Tech, Angel, & Game)
And that's the reason why we forever minorities
Hatred for all authorities, fucking up our priorities"

I remember when my soul, hoes and dough was missin'
When I went to all the shows yo my bros are bitchin
Never meant to blow my goal so it's motor spittin'
And when I enter all of my flows I'm so in pole position
I promise, to be the best to mom ya
Get us through get up at the dawn let tech spew flip it like an omelette
Ever since the calm bet you tech ain't made you yawn yet
I sign checks in my pocket are the color upon shrek
The industry never passed the baton guess I grabbed it
If it's beyond us even so I get the gauntlet
This music shit was enough to make me vomit
But I kept you all astonished make way for the KC comet
Now I'm wanted I'm more sarcastic than Vince Vaughn yeah
Honestly when I walk in I come off like bomb threats
Cause them no want Tech to go straight 'nam vet
Throw on jets and get all the way to this land that was promised
(Chorus - Nikkiya)
Look at me what you see livin' life in luxury
Rollin' down this road to win this thing
This is the promiseland (this is the promise land) this is the promiseland (this is the promise land)
What you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat then storms, and wrecked with demons chasing me
To this promise land (to this promise land) to this promise land (to this promise land)
(Verse 2 - Tech N9ne)
Would you let me kiss 'em couldn't defeat me none
We started beastin 'em sellin records mellin seconds
Look at us teachin 'em yellin' tech is hell and methods
Rippin and reachin' em, felon jeffers tellin' heffers
I ain't got no income but I got dough and then some
In come some friends they wanna attend hundreds send em
Knockin' 'em out my chain go side to side just like a pendulum
I'm in to one but the other is impatient waitin for the sin to come
This is what goes on now that I'm in their light
Now they know that I get my flows on they comin' out in their tights
Been chasin this for so long never has been fair fights
Lookin' for them rare sights. it's in there right?
In the land where everything is yours
Not fictitious like the boars all delicious like a smoors.
I'm be walking through the doors they often to the stores
Got me bossin doin' more for the promiseland I'm you and yours, NINA
(Chorus - Nikkiya)
Look at me what you see livin' life in luxury
Rollin' down this road to win this thing
This is the promiseland (this is the promise land) this is the promiseland (this is the promise land)
What you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat then storms, and wrecked with demons chasing me
To this promise land (to this promise land) to this promise land (to this promise land)
(Verse 3 - Tech N9ne)
Is this it? is this what it's all about man?
Eating. drinking. fucking. sucking. snorting. come on man.
Meeting. feeling. touching. we on dames.
Killing. busting. really loving us 'cause we all strange.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha I like it
The promiseland is real simply because I write it.
Don't stare too long and envy cause you might get eye-ritis
Now to get me for shows and lyrics it's high prices
In promiseland, I'm gonna stand, an honest man
This honor gets the drama yes the llama can
Bring disaster on rappers like water on Japan
He got his chance and tech puts it all on his fans
(Chorus - Nikkiya)
Look at me what you see livin' life in luxury
Rollin' down this road to win this thing
This is the promiseland (this is the promise land) this is the promiseland (this is the promise land)
What you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat then storms, and wrecked with demons chasing me

When you met her
She was right so thick
Something better then a wife, no glitch
She won't stop ever, but she might go click
If you leave her you'll see a PSYCHO BITCH
Now she's callin your crib, at nights so sick
Wanna pop up and try ta fight your chick
Lorena Bobbitt, Told her to slice yo dick
If you Ever break up with a Psycho bitch

Don't gimme that shit
But a nigga don't care, never could it be fair
Then I was up in a middle lover
Came a double dare when

I was in a Mutha fuckin' nightmare
How you ganna fuck me on Sunday
Then you wanna say you love me on Monday
You buggin
Thinking everybody gotta bow down because your off at your lovin'
If your on your telephone
And then she lose it when you use it
If you sleep, don't leave it on, nigga, for true she will go though with it
She call a bitch back from your phone and chew the chick a new uterus
Even if that situation not lewd the bitch is ludicrous
Bad when you gotta better bitch around
Sad cause you never wanna kiss her now
Never would got up in the women
If I knew about her medicine
And never wanna take her down
If she take her seroquel, and selects what
The bitch would probably stop and then try to catch yeah
Slipin with a beauty itchin to get chya
You betta hope you neva leavin' the stretcha
If you with a psycho
Don't go thought with it
Be throught with it
Right in the midst of happiness
Her mood will switch and ruin it
You thinking that you know women and your just so intuitive
Bet that a nigga

At the end of this
You will have to shoot a bitch

'Cause she's kickin' it with this rapper, and that rapper
And that factor get a gat clapper
Gotta mash after with a blast at her

(TECH)
This bitch is trippin'
(GIRL)
Okay... I tried being nice
And I tried being sweet
Fuck that!
You're probably out with that bitch of yours
You stupid asshole

Can you believe this bitch?

You think I'm stupid, don't you?

Rough Draft (ha ha, tell em)
QDIII did the beat (all day all night)
Whassup to everybody out there in L.A.
What's really goin' on?
Why do I do the things I do?
Why so many questions?
What am I doing?
I talk to myself... when there's no one to talk to
I wanna ask me a question
When am I gonna make it up out of a hellish and devilish way?
When are you gonna make the mill-ions with the dividends;
When are you gonna make ends generate wind?
Who in the hell, left the gate open? Do you wanna sell?
Is everybody on the wavelength like us?
Why do I rip it in half, do we kick ass with
Backwards attack this (shit) like hcnup yrlived (punch devilry)
Can you wait a minute? Can you slow it up a little bit
Nina so I can get up in it?
But did you really wanna dabble in fanatical supernatural
Lyrically-radical milli minutes, I'm about to begin it
Can I get some, can I spit some, which one?
When am I gonna get off this trip?
Can I take another pill, why do I feel
Like I'm a sick individual in the room, poppin' off at the lip?
Do you, feel me? Do you do voodoo really?
Did you get it? Did you want a real epidemic?
Will you let me run up in it?
What's the word; is it absurd? What is that this (shit) you heard?
Was it real, is it real, was it really real?
Tech9ne in it to win it besides QDThird occurred
Who's the worst, who's rastafari?
You never livin' never sure it's Selassie I the First
Brother on the planet Earth, who? Do you wanna flow;
What you wanna do?
How can I be in the zone like this, gone like this?
How can I break the obsession?
In the middle of it all, when I snap back, step back
And ask myself; what, why do you ask so many questions?
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill 'em in this
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill 'em in this
Do you understand? Whatcha gonna do when N9na hit you
With the critical homidical lyrical killer flippin
Leavin' you with boo-boo underpants?
How does it feel? Do you wanna come up and chill with an assassin?
Can you feel it inside, what?
The feeling of a commotion of two titans clashing
Why me, who are you, what I am supposed to do - what a nigga here fo'?
Who do you fear mo'? Is it the N9ne, with a brand new joint?
Like to hear it, here go!
What are you lookin' at, when am I gonna get a dose of thorazine?
Can you give me a little something to ease the pain?
Ease the man, who's the man?
Tecca N9na with the Rouge Dogs and the Midwest Side Crew's to blame
Can I get a little backwards attack this (shit)?
What do you accomplish, ever can't you diss, diss
Pitless bottom of aye, and you toss out nigga ass, bade mitch
Hater player percent a hundred that is
Side West Mid, down ever who off, what?
Aggin (nigga), did you know Tech N9ne hot like a dragon?
Did you feel it baby? Can you give me a double dose
Of whatever the feeling I'm gettin' is really pain
It's Kobain, for anybody want a piece of this, sickness
Is it a cinch to get with hot?
Who, when, where what why?
I'm at the pinnacle with a killer eye, do I wanna
Die no I just wanna dose of the most inner syringe
Up in my thigh, bonzai!
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill 'em in this

Why?
I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill 'em in this
Now do you know what the real is?
Does everybody think I'm twisted? Non-realistic
Or do you think that I'm gifted, I'ma lifted
Can you help me? Am I lookin' at you
Can I be peepin you from afar, please, remain calm
Could you be the reason I'm a bomb
Straight out of Vietnam, ready to explode on Satan!
Tell me what the problem is, I'm a'ight what the bottom is
Do you know what a empty column is?
Am I your worst nightmare? I feel sick right there
Should I blow it out, can I do without, do I need help?
Am I living within a pen of demons?
I'm stressing, can I get a blessing (from who?)
The one who cursed me with all these questions
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?

I'm at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill 'em in this

Do that over or something man

Hey QDIII kick the temp on the sign nigga

I was kicking it
With this chick for a minute
She picked me to hit it
Real stiffly I sitted
He spit
Then we quit it
Then I told her
To miss me
And splitted
Quickly I lit it up
No problem to get it up
Then she called and said
She needed me to help her
Get rid of what
A baby
She said she wanted me to kill it
No evidence
Blood
Don't spill it
I'm saying at first
I didn't feel it
But then I started to ponder
On what was coming up
Yonder
A baby by a fling
Made days seem
Really somber
So we both were in agreement
The baby I seen it
Thinking of killing it
Made me almost fall
To the cement
This ain't a job
I can do myself
I ain't got the brain for this
So I called a homie in Kansas
Who was trained for this
He said
The way I rap
And make skrill for a living
He said he kills for a living
For the grip span
He's a hit man
So I paid him a fee
He told me
What date it would be
Me and her was down
But I really don't think
The baby was G
So we three road to Kansas
Baby probably thinking we scandalous
Can't even walk
And we band his
Life
Man is trife
Walked in
And he told us to relax
I sat
And he took
Her and baby to the back
Before I came
I smoked some dope
To calm me
They came back
And she was baby less
And she was looking like a zombie
Baby gone (Baby gone)
Were we wrong (Hella wrong)
Gotta move on (Gotta move on)
Let it alone (yeah)
I dropped her off
But she didn't hate me
For killing the baby
She said she still
Wanted to date me
Crazy
I'm riding and I'm thinking
Why
I took a life
But I ain't tweeking
I know God
Probably thinking
I should die
Real killer
That is me

A couple of years later
I'm creeping with this chicklet
Little thick chick
Hit it raw
And gave her triplets
I need to learn to hold my liquid
So I called my man
In Kansas City, Kan
I told him I
Needed him to do it again
After he put 'em away
I asked him
Homie how could you
Be so raw
He said to me
How could you be so raw
We scatted
One year later
I splatted
In the same chick
She wanted to have it
But I made her do
The same shit
So I murdered five kids of mine
I'm 'bout to sit in hell a lifetime
Bid for mine
Cause of abortion
No more

We're on the highway rolling to Californ-i-a
Seven of us heaven love us 'cause it's evil in front of us
We must trust that G-O-D got our backs on this T-R-I-P
In the van we watchin' flicks and getting our kicks on route 66
Forty west got us dozin' my eyes closin'
Almost on E and so we stop to get some gas
Somewhere outside of Arizona people's persona
Seem like they put niggas in a coma or bullets in their ass fast
I went in to get some petroleum rodeo circus
These trashy mothafuckers trying to show me they tat's
On purpose swastika's here swastika's there minding my affairs
Till one shoved me and I said ""Aww this is lovely""
I punched him back and said ""Take that from a black""
His posse ran up I threw my hand up said ""Let loose the gats""
They said ""We're the type of boys that kill coons by the hour
Nigger one God, one race, seig heil white power""
I said ""fuck you Bill Recio you spacey ho, I heard racists were dying
And I'm about to increase the ratio"" while we were scrappin' I heard coon monkey ape baboon
I heard my partner's lettin' loose, they cleared the room
I let off a couple inside their racist encephals
I asked god was I wrong for slaying demons and devils
And if so forgive me but now it's 2 wounded and 3 dead
From shots to the head them racist motherfuckers bled (x24)
Rednecks are the ones who bled next
First they used to hang us
Now they get them heads checked
For bullets and abrasions that evil persuasion
This is one of the many, many flaws of this nation
I'm just a hard workin' brother at Ford
Report to work pronto amigo in my raggedy accord
Assembly working no smirking I get the job done
White folks staring at me like I was Dennis Rodman
Fuck it it must be the bandana I wear saying black owned
See them whispering everyday but they can yap, yap on
Saw it comin' a mile away and it figures
Somebody took a grease pencil and wrote on a car ""whites own niggers""
Paid it no mind now it's lunch time
I'm eating quietly then a voice said
""You don't belong in society""
I looked then I felt like gaggin'
This white trash mother fucker
I heard that he was the grand dragon
Fuck it I'ma tag him, skull drag him
But his recruits equipped with steel toe combat boots
This is crazy for four hundred plus we've been infamous
Stigmatism is realism the idealism is to hinder us
Put his fingers in my face I bent 'em back
He said ""you fuckin' jerk"" and told me to watch my back after work
I punched out and walkin' to my car
I'm driving and I see this motherfucker he's following me from afar
Pulled over like an idiot jumped out and said what's happenin'
We started scraping he cut me with his knife
I took his knife there goes your life god forgive me
Because I slit his redneck, now all that's left is a fuckin' dead peck
Rednecks are the ones who bled next
First they used to hang us
Now they get them heads checked
For bullets and abrasions that evil persuasion
This is one of the many, many flaws of this nation
The demons are gonna kill me I feel it comin'
I'm a little piece of love and a pit full of 'em gunnin'
The pit is the planet damnit it's full of killas and racist
If god make it I'm saying god take it break it
Demoniacs of all colors crippers and blooders arian brothers die
If you fuck with any of us god lovers
A southern wind hit the Midwest
My mother cringed cause her vocalist
Keep fuckin' with white national socialists
Everybody wants to be the chosen God's people
When teaching hatred hatred at the steeple steeple
Lethal sequels when churches burn we purchase germs
Like guns to slaughter all the motherfuckin' surface worms
Be warned all fronts got the right to fall once
And the racists be the ones we call dunce
Down to die for my love so before you cease us
You gotta (what?) crucify me like Jesus leave us rednecks"

I feel don't nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose
I got my face painted, crazed ain't it
That a black dude lookin' like he got a white tattoo, people thinkin' that he way tainted... by evil
Treat you like fecal, wanna beef you when they meet you
People perceive you to be lethal when you ain't see through like tissue
I feel like the industry givin' me vivid stupidity
When they distribute these fictitious sissys when I rip it so serious and wickedly... no forgivin' thee
When I claim with Strange everyone tellin' me I'm insane, we're bane
I'm an independent, talented individual workin', but the industry is the reindeer game
And they call me Rudolph the Red, they know I don't rip a mic but I chew off the head
Spit it at the PDs and DJs and VJs who be gay, you fakin' you get threw off a ledge
If you tough we snuffing, homie trust me nothing
Is worse than knowin' you're beautiful but get treated like an ugly duckling
So I'm Rocky Dennis, but I'm so polished nothin' can stop me in this
Bad in the brain and the good is not replenished, the fakers who imitate me and mock me, finished
We check the mill, yes it's real
Through Strange I don't need ya major label record deal
That's real, people act a different way with me

They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose
They tend stray away from me because I'm different
And it's been this way with me ever since I was an infant
Other kids were jealous, they say that the look up off in my eyes seemed hellish
Never knowin' later in life I would relish, the thought of me ballin', livin' my life and sell it
I blame it on program directors, go and request us, no damn selector
But if you got a lot of dough man they bless ya, sure can depress ya
When you knowin' that there ain't nobody better mayne, stuck off in the cold when the bad weather came
Now they gotta see me livin' it up and cheddar gain, comin' from forever pain till it never rains
So I throw up the finger to everybody who got a tore up demeanor
Thinkin' that Tecca N9na was sho' 'nuff a dreamer, but the flow is so heavy it could show up Katrina
Now it's time to take it, and you all must face it
Tech N9na is sacred, all of you hatin' fakers couldn't see me with Lasik
Red nose, the leader so follow, you gotta be ready to get up and go is the motto
Made it through everything negative, bravo, the money that's comin' to me feel like I won the lotto
Now I'm 'bout to put the slay on auto
Swoop down on the DJs tell 'em all to quit the replays make 'em put Tecca N9na in the Serato
That's real, people act a different way with me

They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose, red nose
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose
I'm comin' in drivin' my short bus, with this nose I don't need a torch up
Bustin' through like the industry's Porsche, comin' after who didn't support us
Rip down its bleachers, I blew up 'cause my sound is æther
Underground up and found this creature, not scared of a nigga with clownish features
I'm makin' a name outside your mainstream
Real, it wasn't an insane dream, from the beginnin' I really came clean
You about to see Strange gleam, take it over an' gain green
Strange Music and RBC along with Fontana we gon' change things
Now it's so funny 'cause with money I can fly away
Or leave them haters off in the deepest darkest hide away
Why do they do me wrong? My music truly strong
Because I'm different all you cowards wanna shoo me gone
Yes this is Strange year, worldwide fame's near
But the game's queer, sometimes I feel like I'm Rudolph the Reindeer
And the music they said blows, is on top and the cred grows
You're gonna have to open up the door for the bro with the red nose
That's real, people act a different way with me
I feel don't nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes

Like different signs that ain't my kind got they 9's whistlin
Like a nigga wanna find this and strip clips till my wines drippin
But nobody wanna do no crime they just talkin' about rhyme spittin'
When I'm at the movies, careful how you steppin to me
'Cause I think who's starin' at me wanna do me

Snatch it back and act innate, rainin' down the hand of god
Chopper get to sanging nigga smokin' like his elder bar
Forgive me Lord I'm trynna keep it cool
But I'm a old nigga with a quick fuse, quick to smell the bitch in dudes
Hard to walk in Scooby's shoes, do the shit that Scooby do

Do what they say, release and just retrogress with mayday
I'm thinking of retrogression, about going back to my best friend, on a x
Bench, but the uncut molly will you kill me is the question, I'm in sessions
With about two chicks on deck in my bed undressing now we meching pressing
Sexing sweating left in impressive heaven, I usta, boosta, wit aderol, my
Teeth would shatter oh no it really don't matter y'all, I'm cool like the
Cigarettes I was a bigger threat to the clitoris, successful sexually
Bitter neck get her wet just how hight can a nigga get, blasted acid f
Asterix see coulda he say he may crash it fit to replay DJ ashes,
I take masses so I could stay plasted, that great plastic I ate like aton
Lake plasid.
Molly I miss you if I was to kiss you will you take this sick food to go
Days, I know you can lift moods when I'm having issues I wish I could split
Spoove to the old days.

If, you, feel, like their plan don't fit us all,
Then, you, will, find my land don't give us long,
If, you, feel, like not taking that bigger fall!
Then with all respect if we retrogressed then they'll rid us all!
Okay so lets go, retrogression I'm guessing that recno, sees memories all in
My flesh though, strange love he's into the pesh mode, some of the greatest
Sex wow that x ho
And if I was bringing a vix tips to her lips it was for something that
She'd never let go
I drink shots with her laugh and smoke newports the time we spent was too
Short
My mind is heading due north, my body's on it's true course, this woman has
Got my youth sore, and tooth raw, all of the lights are leading me through
A new door.
Can't we just go back? Can't we just reunite? I need a throwback to seeing
You in flight
You had that down south body with a hint of death, picked you up and held
You down
Sound until I went to rest, but who needs rest, when the world is gold
Everything is burning so I'm'a just alert the globe, and hurt you slow,
You're known for fast love and vertigo, so I'll just pick you up and get a
Little intimate in a minute, a cue for the return of a virgin soul.
If, you, feel, like their plan don't fit us all,
Then, you, will, find my land don't give us long,
If, you, feel, like not taking that bigger fall!
Then with all respect if we retrogressed then they'll rid us all!
I tuned 'em out, I, I tuned 'em out, too busy turning on it dropping out
Behind my, my mommas house, producing clouds, never understood money to get
Numb, meanwhile I'm bleeding out my eyes, heaving out my lungs, trying to
Avoid the sun, curiosity young age for a taste, watching them numb they
Faced, tell caroline found someone for us to bring out on dates, I call it
Youthful curiosity, jumped the edge every Saturday
Strobe lights and low lifes the city at night was calling me, I turned em
Out, I, I turned 'em out, he'd 'em both kissing on my lips then smoked the
Spliff to boost the trip,
Lift off, I'm gone, phone call my bro let 'em know that I'm lost and I got
Sand in my shoes
From twilight beach - menajahtwa, heavily sedated I, grew up with jaded
Eyes, see she's been friends of mine since 99' but now we don't see eye to
Eye, can't retrogress, unless life gets too heavy for my chest, then I be
Tuning out and canin dropping out before they win."

The moshers! The stompers! The jail breakers!
We gon start this shit off right!
We got KCMO in the house tonight!
We gon start this shit off right! (Off right!)
We got Tecca Nina in the house tonight! (Come on!)
This is the moment for riders and thugs
Strippers in body bags, empassin violence and drugs
Poverty, a bunch of minorities die in the clubs
They say my music's makin' 'em lose it, I write it in blood
This is my music for all my people missin' my music
Keep listenin to it, and like I said, get a pistol and use it
Satan shot my homie Maintain with a missile and blew it
For the industry, 'cause he was one of the truest...
I don't know why they keep pumpin it's somethin'
Maybe in the music they wanna be bumpin
It's crunk and it's hella haterific
Throw your set up in the air is all the DJs really wanna play
When October is lookin' bloody and Satanistic
Killas from everywhere listen to me when I be bustin' shit
Then turbulence, don't get nervous when I wreck arenas
Concert promoters in Honolulu don't wanna see me
'Cause they say that Somoans will riot on Tecca Nina 'cause I'm a...

You push, you shove, you get elbowed!
Back on 'cause this for Fat Tone and Mac Dre
All of the soldiers who got gone on that day
All my people's that's sittin' in prison
This is for you so wont you listen to the shit that I'm spittin'?
Fuck the law and the government they'll hymn yo ass up
They'll do everything in their power to get a fast buck
No right or wrongs, just killer bees out for your honeycomb
But you'll find out, when you bind out, you can be free if your money long
Ever been to one of my shows? Yeah, it might be crazy
In Ohio, that shit got a little too hyphy, baby
Stage diving and crowd surfing couldn't hold back
But they dropped her, now she's unconscious with her skull cracked
Now when this happened, it wasn't even during my set
They wanted me to give a sign to post up the hospital debt
When Travis told me we got papers, I thought he was playin'...
This bitch is suin Tecca Nina for a hundred grand! 'cause I'm a...

It's Skatterman, cat, Strange Music's black sheep. (Why?)
'Cause I'm still countin' money off the back streets
Every city, every show, I got to pack heat
This ain't no fucking rap song, check my rap sheet
I'm one of a kind, turn one into nine
Blow your head of your shoulders, dog, it's nothin' but time
And I never raise my voice. You a bum, why should I holler on you?
With a whisper I can drop a couple dollars on you
Sss... sss... sick them rottweilers on you
Killers bustin' out the windows of Impalas on you
A made man in the streets, I made grams
Wrote lyrics about my life, dropped an album, and made fans
Now I'm chillin' on tour with the redhead wonder
Do 57 shows in a three month summer

Gonna be found in some park with his nuts in his neck

Suzy Qs ain't no excuse for the sin
So watch your tongue, if you movin we come to shootin up at you and your bitch
You just assume you tried the shoes, they ain't fit
You never knew that I lose you off in the section with your dude in the ditch
Whether it's reppin dog, or movin them bricks
I keep it gutta little homie, look my records, see I'm doin' it big
As you can tell I ain't no regular nigga... I'm filled with star qualities
I hang out with bitches that's naked... and watch the bra swallow me
It's always solo, you can't fake it... so don't try ta follow me
You still can't get back up on your feet... You right back where you ought to be
I see you failin 'cause Strange Music got it locked boy

Yeah we going get real drunk in this one
So, if you don't want to get knocked over
Get the hell outta my spit baby
'Cause we bout' to go
Okay
I like big booty bitches rappin' and Lynyrd Skynyrd
Cases of beer cold as a Kansas City winter
Drink to get drunk then find a chick and put dick off in her
Then make her take me shopping for kicks at Harold Pener
My family gave me rock, my family gave me rap
The streets gave me guap, the streets gave me straps
Black bitches fuck me, white bitches love me
Trust me I do 'em both at the same time rough as rugby
Do 'em both to Bon Jovi, and then to Public Enemy
Energy in me definitively I'm on Hennessy and then I'm on Jimmy B
I used to have red spikes at raves, and then turn around havin' blue and red fights with k's
Your parents got a cold shiver 'cause a pot of gold hit a
Fatha gorilla that's a dolla go getta
And he's an awesome flow spitta
Your daughter goes wit a guy who loathes millers
Why?
'Cause I'm a rock and roll nigga
They don't understand me
God naturally tanned me
You don't like it I can be a nigga
Rockin' 600 diamonds, black and white bitches cryin when they eyes hit this rock 'n' roll nigga
And I ain't changin, got my slipknot bangin' and I
Swear to God I ain't never ever giving up
Fried chicken wings and Coors Light nigga what?
High school hung with a white bruha
Came home then I went straight to Jumu'ah
Then after that I put back on my red puma
Then bark at a chick the same height and color as Uhma
And we get the lead out to Zeplin we blow the bed out
Got a call from one of the homies in trouble so yo we sped out
Got to the hood and found a rivalry took his head out
We had to show them evil motherfuckers what that red bout
Until we find the killers you know we will search
For those who kill first we gon let the steel squirt
And this mentality's valid because we real hurt
To ease the pain I listen to Getty, Alex and Neil Pert
Growin' up it was a chore, 'cause I gravitated towards stuff the homies ignored
Like trippin' off bad brains when on my skateboard
Even more, I named my gangsta rap label after The Doors!
My momma made me, raised me
Played me 80's made me crazy
My father played me crazy made me aid me vaugly praised me
But I'm a real with a lotta will
Remembered I would kill for a dolla bill
But that all changed with strange man I gotta deal.
Like every scholar in the game, got alotta mil
Still a riot maker fuckin' bring the house down
Who that gang bangin' rocker wit the loud sound
That's Tecca Nina wit the shit that make them broads hound
Telekinesis wit my speeches get them drawers down
And that goes for the grand dragon daughters too
And the Neo-Soul conscious chicks they wanna swallow who?

That's what it be feelin' like when they bear you through
Every stereo radio, and they swear you true
But the dopey delivery is unbearable
Drink (Caribou)
Gotta grab your nads, you in the building
Rip it till you blast, they ass, up in the ceiling
Look a lot of rappers trash, ain't got the feelin'
Not in your brain, to wanna change, up your energy game
What a shame, you got a name, but you're lyrically lame
Sedated, save it, cause your memory stained
From 'caine you're faded, a beginner remains
With fame you're jaded, and you give me your lane
I came to spray it, and it finna be pain
Will you please, stop...
Rappin' that crap that you givin' me, mayne?
I been fiendin foe, meanin' flow
But they thought process seemin slow
You ain't gotta rap hella fast for me to like you
But wake the fuck if they screamin, bro
And that's good, you're able to get your green and go
But a lot of you shouldn't wanna be seen in show
'Cause when I go to your set you be leanin low
(Rock, rock) rockabye (rock, rock) rockabye
(Stop, stop) stop, you won't play me

Never do you really gotta be I'll as me
Lyrically, stalled
Lot of rappers gonna wanna grit they grill at me
Furiously, y'all
But when you run up and then you find out villains we
Fear is recalled
Music and murkin niggas don't really wanna deal with me
Seriously, dawg
Your flow's on NyQuil, or them night pills
Or that codeine, that y'all drank
It's a funny sight for real, the people like you still
When you so lean, that you can't
Spit one of your verses, worse, you just faint
Better get a nurse, a hearse, and kiss paint
Watch a nigga urk and jerk, he's on the purp
A Percocet alert, to Earth, if it's quaint in a...
Box, see me comin' but can't even swing at me (weak as fuck)
When you be rappin', you mummy, you don't wanna see me
Screamin up to the tip-top, a lot of you rappin', it be Ziploc
All I'm sayin', is I never wanna have no MSG in my hip-hop
(Ehe-haha! Can you feel it? Feel the swagger, hahaha)

Last thing I'm gon say
The people don't really have green or gold pay
So when you think of rapping and go lay
Your vocal, you better, mash mean and go cray
But if you a beginner still, in a deal
And yo remedial rappin' is in a mill
I guess I better slow it down a little bit and go pop me a couple of (Benadryl)

It's a must
Never ever paid and came with lust
My aims for trust
Cuzz my womans pain is enough
Don't want my marrige ending stranger then us
But just here recently
My brains corrupt
One night my niggaz took me to the strip club
Bazookas
Everybody know the name of the kinda shit I'm use ta
Seduca, so that means there was no clothes
Got my eyes open wide
Like I'm on No Doz
Look at these bozos
Givin' double 0's for hoe shows
I was cool
I was drinkin' my juice
Wasnt really in the mood
Till I was approached by a beautiful angel
In the nude
But I flipped my top
When she sat that butter skin on my lap
I was shocked
Lips locked
Feelin' like my heart stopped
She was hot!
She was Carmen Electra in the chest
Alliya by the waist
Jennifer Lopez in the ass
But she was an angle in the face
She asked me if I wanted to dance on the couch
WIth the look of a zombie
I reached into my pouch
And shelled it out
Then she took my hand
And led me to the land
Where a man could forget about all his problems at
Hand
The scent of a woman
She wearing shenell, hypnotized by the smell
A glimpse of hell and bodily melt down
Is what I felt now
I cam with 500
Tryin' to keep it all
But she want it
At the ATM to get 4 more
That's for you and me, now bitch lets go
Hevenly can't descibe this woman
Beyond that, I feel the area bump and grind
Like combat
No penetration
Its funny
She didn't kiss me or fuck me
But got away with all my money
S.H.E.
(Chorus - repeat 4X)
Took everything that I had
Made me want sex hella bad!
The next day my wifes checking the account
She said your only bringing 4,000 a month
So last night you spent 1,00 on what?
A new piece of equipment
For the studio
But she won't ever really know
That I spent it on another nude show
I close my self in the bathroom
Lean over the stool
And grabbed my middle section tight
Thinkin' about the way she made me feel that night
I had alot of fun
Then I got one, and another one, and another one
I went back that night, and the next night
Repeated here I come
Wife pissed cuzz I depleted all our funds
She left me and moved back with her moms
I'm borrowing money from all my homies
I know that I'm wrong
But this bitch was the bomb
I'm paying the bills at bazookas
I slip my finger through her g-sting
It was tight
She told the bouncers
Now I'm in a fist fight
You put on how you love me
And how you like it rough like me
All these motherfuckers and your man
Can't love you enough like me
I lost my life for you, my wife for you
I miss you
So I'm sitting outside the club every night for you
That's right for you, shit

Small deeds
And get nothing, but I'll run up in it, all creeds, planting the seeds

Its gettin' hotta
Nobody move, nobody get burned
Bullshit if I more flex, I guess I'm on it when I get dressed in the latex
I bone it

Get mines, the big times waitin for me
Was tryin' to get signed
Heard my moms got a record deal with Jimmy Jam and Terry Louis
Prospective, now I'm the straight bomb
BOOM, in the face, I'm on the paper chase
Simon said he couldn't believe I resorted to rhymin
Throw your shit togather
No time for relaxin
Time to go back to popin your 9 milli jackin

I had so many plans, 'cause I got plenty fans
I thought that I was never gonna be alone to spend these grands
But it seems that every girl that I dated somehow hated the way I loved
And I made it with so many, now the ones that are with it, it's not any; they all ran
I thought that I was gonna be Hugh Hef, 6 women to go 2-step but not one of my crews left
Kids are growing up and they got lives now nobody arrives now
Used to be married but narcissism let my bride down
I used to be a playa, I used to be afraid of bein' alone
But they all eventually said ""I'll see ya lata'""; much lata'
Sittin' in this plush lair must say I'm stuck in a rut
I guess not enough prayer
Cause ain't nobody came back, I bust the same raps
But ain't no dame pack wish I could change that
They say that I'm extra I'm messed up and I murk the deals
That I have with them in the past and I miss 'em and it hurts for real
(Hook: Courtney Kuhnz)
See the man with the broken heart (He's just right over there)
All alone he stands so lonely in this world so cold.
He's been hopeless from the start (He feels like no one cares)
Born alone he'll die so lonely: saddest story ever told
(Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung)
Sooner or later rumors gonna tear me up in pieces
And he's just bad luck everywhere I go I'm sick of this steepness
More money more problems, no money problems gettin' worse
He don't have to get bloody but he didn't have to get hurt
Fuck I'm so tired of all this cryin' it don't work
Its affectin' my work, not even carin' about my work
Thin line between love and raps, Strange got the fans comin' back
Bad plus bad run in packs, startin' to think is a curse
I can't you do it without you nigga'
Can't be done without me nigga'
Well, yes it can, wait, please don't do it without me nigga'
Strange move on without these lyrics, makin' it to wear these fans can hear it
I'mma have to get done I'm near it, Brotha Lynch Hung you can't be serious
I'm starin' at these pills, in the back of the Cadillac, and matta' fact
I got it I grip my steel, I'm always on this suicide thinkin' that's how I feel
I figure if I get rid of these pills nobody would care if I'm killed
My label's on the road, me just sittin' at home, see
Spit in that chrome, me gettin' that gold

She let my zipper down and pulled the head out and licked that (she licked that)
Sometimes I had to fight to get my dick back,
But baby moved to Minnesota, swear to god I miss that
The way she used to grab and smack herself all in the face with it,
Lookin' at me dead in my eyes while she be tastin' it (tastin' it)
She used to say ""daddy you wastin' it"" (wastin' it)
I used to say ""baby I'm facin' it""
But fuck the hot water shit, she used that crushed ice (crushed ice)
If she suck your dick once she make your nut twice (nut twice)
She was just that good, I could sell her for a stack to my boys in the hood
So if you got you one of these, keep them fakin bitches to the curb
Leave this on her voicemail, all you need is seven words
(Krizz Kaliko)
Now as she sucks my soul, I lick her funky emotions
Piercin all the way into her mind so I can feel what she's thinkin'
(Feel me? I know you do)
We're getting closer and closer, eruption is imminent, climax is closin in on us
If you don't get your hands on me soon, I might disappear
'Cause what I been waiting on, the best thing you ever heard,
The one, two, three, four, five, six; seven words
(Tech N9ne + Girl)
[Tech]-""mm, mm... you know what I want you to do, right?""
[Girl]-""Yeah, I know what you want me to do...""
[Tech]-""What's up?""
[Girl]-""Do you want it with hot water?""
[Tech]-""What's that??""
[Girl]-""You mean to tell me freaky ass Tech N9ne never had it with no hot water?""

Sex out south-some hit in and out
Screamin 'n' cussin-some bustin' it out
Sex out south-some freaks comin' out
Sex O S is what it's all about
(Verse 1: Kutt Kalhoun)
I got this bitch named Janae from Olathe
Baby girl was flagrant
Bitch is in sexual favors
Told me I could take it
Got a fettish addicted to pain
Wanted me to choke her
While she sat on my dinck came
All over the sofa
But this hoe from the o she was cold
Didn't like to swallow it
A pull to the back of the throat
Kept a bitch from vomittin
She begged for a dick in her ass
Baby liked it anal
But my head was too big for her ass
So I used my fingers
Down to Dallas with Rita and Alice
White and Phillipino
One on my dick and one tossin my salad
Off in the casino
Real sex ain't got shit on these vets
Told 'em they could keep me
Even thought about writin the check
I'm coocoo for a threezy
To all you bitches and hoes, living your life unexposed
You better peep this out south bitches as pros
If you don't know how it goes
You besta follow your nose
Get on some freak shit
Now follow as the story is told
It's like...
(Verse 2: Tech N9ne)
I know you heard that I talk alota shit about a bitch
But I'm bout to swerve this time
Talk about a different kinda chick
The ones who love the dick constantly in an out
Even like to put it in her mouth
And I'm not talkin' bout northbound bitches I'm talkin' about those bitches down south
You can find 'em in the 50's all the way to Grandview
You can get 'em up in Overland Park and Olathe
Thank you for the paper
Never given a fuck about what your bitch is thinking pety shit is second nature
Throw 'em in the mix nigga fuck 'em witha friend
They will be callin you so you can do it again
You ain't gotta spend ain't gotta pretend
Call her up and tell her you needa put it in
And not just white
There's hella beautiful back bitches
Give it from the back
They lovin' the dick too
Down north women
They hate the bitch brew
I know you don't like what I'm sayin' but it's true
And y'all be fuckin' the bitches like we be fuckin' the bitches
We be out for the pussy and we rockin' you bitches
Nothing you never could tall a nigga could be stoppin' nigga
'Cause I ain't had enough of you bitches
Now sex down south
When you put it in her mouth
And you don't need help from hitch
You can find 'em in a house of six
Do the damn thing with one and switch
Any other women hatin'
Got a nigga waitin for that weak shit you pitch
Play that shit
The down bitch quit it sit down sweat it skited now bitch!
(Verse 3: Big Krizz Kaliko)

Cause them the ones I love out south get my head gone
And they never wanna let me pull it out when I'm in 'em
So I'm pullin the rubber out
When I need it I'm takin' the southern route
And it was late at night clutch your lady tight
Or me and my niggas out south!
Get it with no doubt
Sit it your mouth
If ya with it then baby let me hit it down south!
Still I got too many bitches that I'm suppose to be
And the ladys really lookin' like they hoes to me

Oochee koochie the way you do me
You really give it to me when we be under the cover
Felicia-O I'm glad to meet ya

I see shadows on the road again,
Wonder if they comin' for my soul,
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in,
Will I ever grow old?
Will I ever grow old?
I remember them high nights,
On X we find sights,
To climb heights, unheard to men we line white
Molly up and had to be nine flight,
Mix it with weed and wet it's kronkite,
That shit's beyond hype,
Sped us up and we be trippin' seein' some shit
And it's fuckin' up the buzz of me and the clique
So we hop up in the whip and flee with the quick
But the shadow makin' us swerve and we on the strip
Did you see the shit?
(Yeah I saw the shit)
Did y'all see the shit?
(Yeah we saw the shit)
All agree that a shadow was crossin the street and immediately vanished, we need to hit
I see shadows on the road again,
Wonder if they comin' for my soul,
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in,
Will I ever grow old?
And will I ever grow old?
Is it comin' for me because all the shit that I did in the past was bad to people,
Mad and evil, if you the AOD I'm sad to meet you,
Angel of Death, when I quit doin' X,
Because of seein you every night on the stretch,
So I been clean for 3, years and countin',
Still I'm seein' shadows will the scheme for me
To follow them into the pit of despair,
Punishment for what I did in this lair,
What if evil spirits live in the road,
To take the kindred spirits polluted souls
I don't know how the spirit thing goes
Really livin' in my frontal lobe,
Will I be living life until I'm old
Or will I be taken by shadow's on the road?
I see shadows on the road again,
Wonder if they comin' for my soul,
I get trapped up in this mode I'm in,
Will I ever grow old?
Will I ever grow old?"

And Adam said, ""This is the bone of my bones
And the flesh of my flesh""
Sin with me I want you. She-devils in the house let me hear ya
(Hey) off top I gots to get near ya
Verse 1 (Tech N9ne)
Often they blow ya top watch when they hold ya jock
Shocked when the notch sold crotch and you lost composure
Soft for the ho's ya not stocked fulla roll ya walk for the
Hot shot wanna cop and do lots of dosha
She devil her greed level is hella high
Speed rebel exceed pedals with a devils eye
They call girl and strip they all twirl and trip in yaw world
They dip and all thorough and hip
Hustlers they sluts and drug smugglers
Money they double up throw that stuff up and bubble up
Best believe when I get ya I'm bout to strap it down
Cause wadatah Imma tippy tah on ya capitown
I go to have it now, TECH N9NE it's a habit
Got to stab it I'm savage hound
She devils are incredible out 4 thy dough
At her crilla is scrilla ex and tapes of Taebo yo
Verse 2 (Bizarre)
Today my wife left, I don't give a fuck bitch
That's why I'm paying you 150 bucks
To suck me and Kuniva
Let this diabetic dick touch your saliva
I take 'em blid and crazy 14 to 48
Every since we fucked I been coughing and losing weight stink ho
Trying to creep bitch pick your son up
He been at school for a week (mommy!)
You fucking freak trying to get the best of me
Kidnap you ass leave you lost like Kelly without Destiny
You stank trick you suck dick Jason Williams
(What up!) Shoot this dirty bitch
Verse 3 (Kuniva)
This devilish bitch is so succulent
Taking a piece of my soul every time that I bust a nut
She's like a succubus a nymphomaniac laying me back
On a fitchy mattress cum stinking smelling like catfish
Still I hit yeah I did it her pussy travels it doesn't have a pivet
I remember when she was timid your scandalous ass
Taking the pastors cash got 'em on the sucking your tits
Snorting and passing hash
I still had to grab that ass had to laugh at stories
About you ragged ass-licking maxi pads, you dirty bitch
You used to be nerdy bitch
Now she's in the backyard fuck thirty pits
Verse 4 (Kon Artis)
Now besides being on ex and regardless of having sex
We getting close to gellets just grinding to every kick
2 fingers up in her pussy my hands rubbing her tits
As soon as my wife push me her man's fucking a trick
(I don't care she know I trick) but she's starting to get hip
To it 'cause she's finding matches inside of my pockets
That say I strip which means I might get caught lose
Everything that I bought, the house, the kids, and the car I know it sounds bizarre
But we should give her a call and see if she want it in that way
It's 3-way sex and we can all be friends
I know you've done it before don't act like you haven't whore
I'm bout to lose my wife I can't afford a divorce
Verse 5 (Swifty)
Fucking with your pussy it's a handful you think
I'm drowning then you clowning
So basically bitch you're a damn fool and that's a given fact
Plus I remember back when you was young I could see 100 niggas through your gap
And all of them was probably hitting that
That's embarrassing you're stuck with 30 children, 20 miscarriages
In and out of buildings ain't caring who it is fucking newlyweds
Didn't mean to do it but you did slut
Verse 6 (Proof)
Devilish she's never to be faithful
Credit or fee it's better that she's tranquil
Even a apple my cock can unlock
The key to your asshole
Stop the plot do the freeze on my cash flow
Cock the gloc I threw these in the castle
Fresh outta school with a disease and a tassle
Ski's and it's natural you just my ho that's the reason you stack dough"

At a party I got to be
But the Tech was a shock to me
That will let my velocity slow
Wanna party with me let me know

We party to celebrate
To keep from goin' insane
We party just to escape
No matter how much the cost
Regardless of what it takes
You call my phone and it's off
I'm tryin' to numb the mistakes
But if you feel like you chill put yo cups up
But if you ill about yo bills and it's just touch
Take a drink but don't spill
This ain't no time to be still

If you're found or you're lost
Hey baby these are the breaks
But if you good it's understood that you prosperous
We from the hood and drinkin' good means a lot to us

For the wrong that has grown

Spent time for dimes
You better take advantage of this moment
Yo
We party 'cause we in pain
We party to celebrate
To keep from goin' insane
We party just to escape
No matter how much the cost
Regardless of what it takes

299,Should I Killer,2012,Boiling Point (2012),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"To the people I might offend with this song,
Forgive me,
This just some sick shit that I was thinkin',
When I was dealin' with some real shit
And it's called: 
I can't hold her, I can't control her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
If I can't grope her, I might as well choke her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
The condom busted, upon this fluff chick
Really bomb and lust when the 'ginas thrusted and I'm disgusted
Can't come in the club bitch, dumb nigga trusted that I won't hit a gust quick
Son shouldve clutched it
What he spit, what he gunned this let it in her rump and erupted
She say she know no pill, she stay thinking on your scrill
She know you're sold your mill and you Tecca Ninna with the solo deal
So what you think she's thinking?
If you fertilize the pink one sinking your linking
Nothing but the jinx now I gotta write her off like an ink pen
If she fattens, she said that it won't happen
Steady laughing at him, mashing splashing ass should've had it fastened
Night is over, now, she ain't showed around town about a month
And I gotta call saying she gotta tote around
Something extra from when I sexed her
My nigga, that' the moment I had a heap a whole plethora
Of homicide thoughts. Can I kill her? Why not?
'Cause if wifey find this out she's gonna take everything I've got
I can't hold her, I can't control her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
If I can't grope her, I might as well choke her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
Killer shit I played it out
Abortion, yes, I paid it out
But every time that I call to see if it's done it's like she waited out like
I got to be further on to get that
Somebody's calling my phone, so hit back
I guess I've been having a dome
To click clack bone to pick at, that's wrong to sit back
And let yourself protrude from something else, no food
But you're gonna tell your dude that you're having my baby
What the hell, that's rude
But you took my money and all my calmness from me
But you reassured me saying she's gonna be taken by her mommy
When her mama took her, she said it kind of shook her
When her mother cried, I told her that God had wanted this baby to push her
To be a better person, read a verse, then yeah they burst in tears
Dead is certain I ain't shed and cursed in years
And as sick as here, make a nigga wanna drip a tear
Man this is fear, 'cause I already got kids and the Mrs near
So I'm vicious, still, twisted admist this wicked fear
Think I'm gonna click this weird chick really quick and the bitch just disappeared
I can't hold her, I can't control her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
If I can't grope her, I might as well choke her
Could I? (Killer!) Should I? (Killer!)
If I kill this woman I gotta apply my stealth
'Cause if my family finds out, wave bye-bye my wealth
And if her family finds out, they're gonna make this guy cry help
I guess it will be way, way easier if I would just die myself"
300,Show Me a God,2009,K.O.D. (2009),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Ey! My momma, my momma, my momma is so tormented,
She been through trauma, more drama, the dawn is gone, it's more tinted,
On this side, it get's out of it,
How does a prophet who loved God as his father's slipping to get the bottomness out of it?
How come an angel gotta be sick in the pancreas, like she an atheist,
Maybe it's the faith that is makin' this lady as crazy and has made me this sceptic,
Next threat is Lupis on top of Epileptic, Never rested,
Psychiatrist forever tested, Reverend blessed it,
Brethren, Heaven, Tech is begging for effin' X-Mas,
Hopin' momma ain't left an exit,
It better get better quick, how you let her get sick with bread invested,
In the church every Sunday, I've been searching for one way,
Or another, you're gonna have to curse me or burst me with a sunray,
To let me know that you're coming or en route,
I'm 'bout ninety-nine, but I need a hundred percent proof!
Show me a God!
Ah!
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a façade,
Show me a God!
Ah!
And if it is, why ain't He doin' his job?
Show me a God!
Ah!
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad,
Show me a God, Please!
Let me know something is Listening when I'm down on my knees!
Where was the Passion of Christ? What happened to passin' his life
For the masses? Bad, it ain't happenin' twice,
'Cause my mother's stacked in a lab stag-nant, nice
I need your help, and I'm not asking it nice,
All in life it's been paramedics, all my life coming up all I heard ""Is There A Medic?"",
A younging, all I could do is stare at it,
Seizure after seizure, if I was you, wouldn't ne'er let it be heredit-tary,
If Aaron get it, I swear that it's scary,
Sitting in a insane asylum,
God or God's Ghost, man I aim to find them,
To take away all of this angel's pain inside, come rain,
If Momma go, how come I can't deny them?
And she's only fifty-four, in a ward watching her war,
And it's more blood and gore, and she tore, 'cause people are so deceiving
And I'm on the floor, because with nor Lord this war absorbs more poor,
Having all the soldiers screaming
Show me a God!
Ah!
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a façade,
Show me a God!
Ah!
And if it is, why ain't He doin' his job?
Show me a God!
Ah!
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad,
Show me a God, Please!
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees!
Think about how all the victims of Katrina feeling,
They need a ceiling, they say that Mother Nature, she the villain,
I Plead a million, the bible, I read a billion, Still I Flee to see the real,
And my feet are grilling, 'cause hellish heat is building up,
Think my momma ain't ill enough? It's killing us,
I will erupt if they're pilling her false, still ain't no healing her,
I been searching for answers, but I find nothing but man stuff,
That puts a damper on the current problem at hand bruh,
Or whatever it is, I will never forgive,
Anybody who take Marty, better get her to live,
She's so sick, it don't matter how much cheddar I give,
To the thing or the lady, here's a letter to his,
Majesty, why ain't you stopping these tragedies?
My mother's glad to be with you, but her life's been a raggedy one,
What's gonna be done in 2012 when Hell's gonna be
When the Earth's aligned with the sun!
Show me a God!
Ah!
I'm kinda feelin' that's it is a façade,
Show me a God!
Ah!
And if it is, why ain't He doin' his job?
Show me a God!
Ah!
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad,
Show me a God, Please!
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees!
That's why I be lookin' for ghosts! Or somethin' supernatural. The only thing I know Supernatural, is the rapper. Maybe if I saw something like that it'd make me change my life or somethin'. Now let's get into K.O.D..."

(Chorus: Krizz Kaliko)
I can't breathe anymore
I've gone the distance
Can't see me anymore
The darkness has overcome
I don't wanna be part of this
But I let it take me
So I let it take me
Now it's dripping all over me
(Bridge 1: Tech N9ne)
We on the surface be hell raisers
We crave good life but born into this dead-zone
I've searched for answers from my female maker
In the cemetery but they never produced her headstone
(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
Black as ever like Shabba
Thick and oozing like lava
See this room with my Prada, dadda
Must've came from my father
'Cause my mama, was an angel
But this thang grow, insane bro (insane whoa)
(Swallowing sound)
This is darkness accumulated
Over the years and heartless buffoons that made it
Over to here on the TV
Cops kill a man 'cause he's trying to buy a BB Gun (BB Gun)
What's gonna happen when they see me come
Really run (Really run)
(Swallowing sound)
I'm 'bout to just boom
Take the madness
Let it explode and shake the masses
Shroud that I carry here to break the rabbits
And awake the maggots
I hate your habits (I hate your habits)
Your evil's consuming me
Now my heart and brain's together in unity
Darkness...
'Cause ain't no opportunity
(Bridge 2: Tech N9ne)
They say my metamorphosis made a monster
In so many ways this statement might be true
Your plan right from the start was divide and conquer
So what do you think I see when I see you?
(Verse 2: Tech N9ne)
Give me your wishes
Give me your hit-list
Bring all the wicked
I'm 'bout to show you I'm vicious
Ligaments and Sriracha's delicious
No stopping for tickets
Don't make me give the crooked coppers the business
(Coppers the business)
(Swallowing sound)
I look suspicious
Wearing your anger
During your danger
Swearing whore wrangler
Don't let me close to y'all
If you touch it it's like an overdose of Propofol
I be the ghost to all
That wanna vote for hogs
I gotta go to maul
(Go to maul)
(Swallowing sound)
Licking my lips, ow!
Burn my tongue
I need a germ to come kill me
In worms and dung lay stagnant
I'm an avid mad lad
See the evil I grab it
Stick to me like a magnet
You can have it
(You can have it)
Rack, I'mma clack on they asses
Brack!
Brack!
Brack!
Give the evil no passes

Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit, get the fuck out
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit, get the fuck out
For those who love raw shit, welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is Tech N9ne
This the style
I use pitch to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick
Mellow tone is what you spit
Switchin the pattern
Bust up that quick Midwest chatter
And some people hate but it ain't matterin
But the people gather it's flattering
Switching the pitch, mixing
There's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin' full clips on a mission for bliss
When I be ripping this shit, make it exciting
Gotta be inviting when you're writing your piece
Never be dick riding
If you're gonna be biting,
You're igniting the beast
This is melodic melodies
If you got it, mix it hot as tamales
You singing off-key is garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, you need to stop it
Have confidence, speak with conviction
Don't put 'em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony, Nina's taking you through it
Make it buttery, utterly beautiful, make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin muthafuckas in music
That's how we do it
Get (on your feet), up (out your seat)

From our West Coast instructor, Crooked I
My killer Dayton's
They keep me crushing the competition
Coming correct when creating the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier
Got a crooked coppa missing
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant cotenant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty, if I'm thurstay
I change the pronunciation of words, per se
The English language gotta do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap, this is how (this is how)
Right now I'm putting swag in my style (in my style)
It's a emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (and a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes gotta be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example
This song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire
Get (on your feet), up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), up (out your seat)
Such an oddity with it, this is sickology

From our East Coast instructor, Chino XL
Everybody start locking your windows and doors
Chino might get in
It's like lightning and hounds striking a trifling riflemen
Bullets flying up and I'm numb in the bum, like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine
He could get rich from the recycling
Chino be curdling blood
Don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction
Like when the branch is heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, industry hate me
Yo, I'd rather hear Hannah Montana
Than half of you rappers on the radio
Startin drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, that's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man with a sick delivery
Like I drive a coroner van
I'm demented, spitting rhythm's as sick as I can
Grenade gripping, fitting to detonate Disneyland
I am teaching Sickology
Try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna
Get (on your feet), up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), up (out your seat)
Such an oddity with it, this is sickology
Get (on your feet), up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), up (out your seat)

306,Slave,2011,Welcome to Strangeland (2011),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(Intro: Tech N9ne)
Fight the pain, inside the rain
A rebel know, to let the devil go
So now to get paid, about to be working like a slave
(Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko)
I'm kinda good, kinda bad, kinda get money can't be mad
I'm kinda broke but I'm kinda rich
Wishing I had a corner I could put a bitch in
They ain't gonna do nothing
Ain't like I'm suffering
Food for a baby's mouth
Then I bought a house for my baby mother and
What's wrong? I try, don't matter, still die
I'm strong, but I'm not
When I'm alone, I cry
Out for you, it's hard to do
I can't see you so doubt for you
When out my mouth I sprout the noose
Too much vodka and mountain dew
Explainin' what I be meanin'
If you listen fast you think I was a Heathen
But the last Sunday receivin' the preacher from the pastor
Ain't even believin' the bastard
But no Hades, god's baby
God made me, a little crazy
And I'm off, I'm gone
My life is my songs
What I mean when I sing, still on a wing and a prayer
But if I listen to what is written in the scriptures maybe it will get me there
Share with the people I swear it is an evil scam that might be in vain
But if I say I I'm the genius then like Jesus everybody gonna know my name
(KALI)
I've been working like a slave oh, lord
And I get tired along this lonesome journey
I done struggled on this road, I've been wrong
I know, I know that there's no peace in my shelter
There's going to be no peace in my shelter
(Verse 2: Kutt Callhoun)
(Oh lord lord lord)
I need reparations due to devastation from the state of present situations
And it's not easy to walk a narrow path in my jeans
It's hard when your family wondering when your going to make another
Stop leaving, stop breathing for a minute 'cause it's all artificial when the laws trying to get you
When them haters right behind 'em and you wanna shove a double barrel sawed off in your denim
What can I do to stop a big catastrophe
When niggas after me and bitches after me
Wanna have my baby, listen niggas lady
Trials and tribulations tackle me
My mama think I made it, she feeling me lately
Proud of her only son born
Kids think I'm the greatest
I cannot display this
Smile feelin' like a funyon
(Salty and all) you'll be (locked in a stall) trying (lost in the cause) truly, no denying
Ain't nobody gonna do it for me
For the moment let it drive me insane
Solicitation of a prostitute
'Cause you a ho when you're playing this game
But it's okay, I am gonna to ride till I triumph
Cause everybody once upon a time was a slave
This is Callhoun
I've been working like a slave oh, lord
And I get tired along this lonesome journey
I done struggled on this road, I've been wrong, I know
I know there's no peace in my shelter
(Verse 3: Tech N9ne)
I work, I play, and I drink booze every day
Drinking 'em up for the blues
Ima say used in a way
Fools run astray
Allah, God, Jesus, Jah somebody please help me
Mama got a problem with diabetes it don't seem healthy
Everything depends on ninna fame hittin dantez sr
Got a nigga thinkin' some of the fans I'm makin' would they wanna do me like Selina
Devil laughin' like a hijena
Losin all the good in my demeanor
I don't wanna go psycho
But choke the flow you know I got ta go and charlie sheen yaa
Tryina stay good with the old lady
My mom made it go crazy no time for my poor babies
So don't let a motherfucker play me
When I say FU pay me
Even though I'm gettin' money you could still see I'm hungry like I'm in Haiti
What am I to do? What am I to you?
But alot of coo, but I'm not immune
Can't you see? I'm stressed not free
From y'all. I'm sick. My body's hot
If in this (pressure) don't let up this will probably stop for
Technina...
I've been working like a slave for long
And I get tired along this lonesome journey

There's no peace."
307,Sleeping Beauty,2006,Everready (The Religion) (2006),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"It was a Saturday night me and my homeboys decided to dip to the movies, and you know us. Always on CP time. So we entered the theatre and we find our seats. Kaliko wanted me to get something from consessions so I did. So I'm waitin in line and I see the baddest bitch homie! I mean I was like fuck the food, what's you name, nationality and age baby? But I forgot the first two when she said she was SEVENTEEN! On the inside I was like:
Fuck, shit, god dammit, mutha fucka, young bitch, whore, slut, cunt, when you gonna be 18?
In the midst of my crisis I heard her say:
Well I'll be 18 in a week.
And I was like Oh yeah? and she said:
Yeah
Man she was a stallion, ass like pow, chest like bang, lips like oh, I had to have her cat! Déjà vu
I'm in the movie and I don't give a fuck about it
I keep thinking about a bitch I met at concession
Really a cutie I wanna get up in up out of her
But the identity sayin' she is one seven
Fuck the movie I'ma go back and spit at her
Throw at her shit at her like my name is Tech N9ne bitch!
When I said it she went ballistic meanin' she was wit it
And loving my complex rhyme shit
I had a brilliant idea to get her back at the crib
And I'd give her some of the bad mimosa
Because I really went Ikea
Got every thizzle if it's comfortable to her than I can hold her
For 'bout a weekend on her b-day
We can leezay she doesn't know that I'm S-I-C-K
All she know is T-E-C-C-A when ya through workin baby ya gonna go with me k?
I want you SLEEPING BEAUTY
I need you SLEEPING BEAUTY
Son of a SUCH A CUTIE
I love you SLEEPING BEAUTY
Come right in baby, have a seat.
All right
Would you like a drink?
Sure I'll have one...
And another and another and another and another and another and ANOTHER!
Very woozie
We off in the Jacuzzi
Beauty is juicy, the liquor musta been a doozy
'Cause she's talkin' hella loosely tryin' to seduce me
But I ain't fuckin' no underage groupie
But I wish I was fuckin' and suckin buckin and crushin and touchin tuckin my stuff in her pretty muffin
But she started huffin and puffin
And talking 'bout nothing the fact I won't get no lovin' is fuckin'
Pushin my buttons
Bitch wit ya fast mouth
I want you to pass out
Then I'ma get yo ass out
Shit she crashed out, gotta get her out or she'll be dead soon
Drug her to the motha fuckin' bed room
Handcuffed her then I turned the music down
Knock knock knock then I heard a pound
Knock knock knock knock a little more
Somebody's knock knock knockin' at my door yo!
Is there a problem officer?
Yeah we got a noise complaint from one of your neighbors, uh you havin' a party?
No, it's just me here man, Imma musician.
Uh we know who you are.
And I'm a star in a movie, that's my projectory here, and the music's already down so.
Well let's try and keep it that way.
I'll keep her... I'll keep it... keep it down, I'll keep it down.
Yay I can hardly wait it's getting closer to our date!
It's been a couple of days
I had to gag her
Back and forth to the bathroom I had to drag her
Cause the drugs I'm givin' her make her stagger
Try to feed her food but it's makin' me wanna stab her
With the steak knife I try to feed her steak wit
Ok, when ya starve to death don't say shit
I'ma set it to the side till ya hungry
I see that ya energy's tellin' me that ya want me
(She said) ""I never knew that you would be the one to be psycho
Why ya reading to me from the bible
Get away from me motha fucka I hate you""
On the morning of ya b-day I'ma take you
Days go by and I'm lookin' at her hazel eyes
I wanna be her sex slave know why?
'Cause you're a beautiful lovely
Want you to trust me
And never judge me
Now do you love me?
I love you, I really love you, I wanna feel you, I wanna touch you, take me outa these cuffs, I wanna hold you!
Look at her sexy ass
Beauitful panties see through like plexi glass
Rip 'em off of her like an animal mesh we clash
On the bottom she put her hand up on my Nestea bags
Heavy kissin' and heavy pushin
If this is heaven I wanna stay
Lord please never take it away
Happy birthday baby
This is how I'm gonna be lovin' ya
And then she put the steak knife through my jugular
Now as the blood trickles
My body wiggles
I'm lookin' up at my beautiful baby while she giggles
I never thought that it would end this way
This ain't how I wanted to spend this day
The webs we weave are so damn tangled
I guess my baby really didn't like my angle
I lie in a puddle of blood neck mangled
I live and die by the hands of an angel"
308,Slither,2002,Absolute Power (2002),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"It was a Friday night and me and my homeboys
Decided to celebrate our departure from JCOR
So you know us, we had to go to the strip clubs
Everybody said they wanted to go to DJ's so we did.
So we get up in DJ's and we got V.I.P.
The owner shows us a lot of love, so he takes us
To our seat and Trav orders a round of 151 and coke
4 all of us, and that's when I seen her
A stallion ass like pow, Chest like bang,
Lips like ew, an angel man but she had the devils eyes,
I had to have her cat
Pass me the 151 and coke cat, then later
We'll find where the dope at, but hold that, I seen
Somethin' so fat that I wish I could've drove back to
Get my kodac
Strip teaser lovin' who got the visa got it then she will
Please ya nada then she don't need ya prada Gucci for leisure
It's her duty to feed ya amnesia caribou and tequiza
Off the turn buckle baby bubba had the booty and boobies
It was a nudy so cudie was a cutie I gotta get near
Her I got a mucho deniro look at her look at herself in
The mirror moving like shakira
Made my way to the front of the stage hunits for days
The body I wanted to praise will she get with a nigga
Maybe she bent over and said thanx and I whispered
In her ear
I love the way you make it slither baby, every night
When I come through that looks like somethin' that I
Wanna run through, (you want some ooow) you know I want you
(Baby we can have fun too)
(Repeat 2x)
2nd Verse
Will she ask me for a lap dance? Then Trav said
She too fine fat chance, boy I'm Tech N9ne I rap
And I slap hands with millionaires and plus I got stacks
Man
She approached me slowly, holy moly, Chef Boyardees cheese
And Beef ravioli hold me close nose be op, how much evil can
Dough provoke (How much?) She told me nope
Said this one was on her, I'm hoping I can get the chance
To put in on her she slithered on me put the booty on
My lap and got ta girating, was I waiting for the
Pushin' grabbing and vibrating
But this is really when my pupils got to dilating
What kind of magical hocus pocus was I facing
Over and over tried to explain it the best that I could
She put her mouth on the crotch of my pants and said (hddddddd)
(Repeat 2x)
3rd Verse
Said she needed 400 to tip out I whip out the grip so
Quick so we can dip out the trick house, told my homies
Not to poke their lip out I'm going to rip out the guts and
Try to throw my hip out
Now it's time to trip out got at the bitch house was 3
Fine female roommates my homies missed out, took me to
Her room and threw me right on the bed got right on the head
What a wonderful night it was said
Then along came 3, 36 double D. Sizes kissin' and lickin'
On me and they comin' to do what wake my dude up but
One of them bitches bit me on the neck and drew blood
Then the other and the others, instead of bud lovers
I'm trapped with blood suckin' mutha fuckas 4 eternity
Brought me here to straight feed on a nigga all
Because I said to a stripper I love the way you make it'

310,So Dope (They Wanna),2013,Something Else (2013),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Wanna sit beside a sick and seductive sinner, see
Something so sinister seeking Sookie somethin' like a centipede
Slitherin', she's searchin' for synergy
Suckin' my seed, chakra tease stickin sippin' Hennessy, shittin'
On the hissin' I'll spit you out of commission
Position the bitch and dip in when I mention slip in submission
All of this is the quicken the copulatin' and kissin'
My operation is rippin' to the body, shakin' and strippin'
Odd when I bust, K.O.D. put 'em in Necropolis
Givin' this rod to the good broads, and they givin' they bras to us
With the gift to break up a couple that's monogamous
Stop with the probs and take off your effin' draws, bitch and rock with us
Been gitty cause them titties, are on my chin-chinny
Chin, did he pretend he was again kiddie
Suckin' the crème de la crème and the skin pretty
Dim lit he, then hitting thee trim in Sin City
Let it in, I'm the medicine, get her wetter than ever been
Never better than a veteran, level that in the bed again
Rockin' red I been in my letterman, bright as Edison
Like I said I sin, head I win at events and I'm fetishin'
Open up, you hoes, you know what's up
Told you when I bust, her clothes they wanna just
Go right off her butt, for sure they wanna cut
Explode, drop a load, cause the flow, is

She said ""I heard that you was packin' I'mma fan of your rapping
I'm feining action where you really from, Cape Town?""
I said ""Yeah, bitch and I was born in London
So I'm thinkin' 'bout fuckin' you with the crumpets and some cake now!""
How did we get so stereotypical?
Fairly so seminal, now I'm flowin' to the pinnacle
I see you got some friends who just lookin' to get it from the medic
So I'ma 'bout to pivot on 'em and then make rounds
Want a piece of the beast from the East?
Complete, in the sheets, release beats, got her man down
Your boy just never could compete with us, please, better believe
We skeet, now wipe yourself off with a ShamWow!
Me and Nina run deeper than receivers, I beat up all on her beaver
Now she wanna feed the meter!
Speakers bumpin' tweeters from here up into Medina leave us pleasin'
Are your nieces screamin' ""Take Me to Your Leader""?
I'm trainspottin' the vein rockin' the lane off and came droppin'
Serious game all on your brain, rottin'!
Pick a million pricks and I'm pretty sure that you missed the one
That hits you on the clit, quick drip! Probably the main option
Blowin' the slut up just for good luck and I'm fuckin' the kitty up
With the angel dust in my nuts!
Trophy lovin' cup and my dopin' is such a must
That it's troublesome they give up when the lust is so dope they wanna

Loving to give it up in it in the back of the room and make 'em screamin'
Go up in it deep as she was feindin' when she saw my weiner
She told me she ready for anything, I'm talkin' anything
I stuck it up in her jaws, I'm breakin' walls, like I was Katrina
Don't even know me, but she know my flow is O.G.
She told me she like to play with the pussy when she get lonely
Homie if I was only right there instead of a Sony
You claimin' the pussy wet, but don't tell me baby, just show me
She ask if I'm comin' up with the mask in my entrance
Sinner in a second real spitter like every sentence
She was there for repentance, ever since I was an infant
I'm damagin' the vagina, remind you I'm filled with vengeance
Hit 'em whenever they ever wanna run up
And they doin' it 'cause I rap and shit
I really don't care, whatever it takes, to get 'em up on the mattress
I could have been the one that's huntin run for bustin' a gun
But this is way more fun to get up in these motherfucking actresses
In bikinis and suckin' on my zucchini
She told me she wanna be me while sippin' apple martinis
Fuck it if I'm a meanie she probably would never leave me
Shit I can play eenie meanie from sly and cuff on my weenie
And now I see 'em on every record and stage
They posted up in the audience, all of 'em filled with hope
Knowin' they only wanna be in the presence
Or get affiliated with you because you was dope
So dope they wanna (Fuck)
So dope they wanna (Suck)
So dope they wanna (Give it all up and really get raw)
So dope they wanna (Fuck)
So dope they wanna (Suck)
So dope they wanna (Give it all up and really get raw)

Hey now Tech, you know I've been the type
To not go all in on I'm hoes I've been around
But the flow I spit gets hoes all in the zone
That I won't talk shit but oh my damn they wrong
And these man calling in their wonder if I'm a get with a little dick
They got no common sense and went no college in
Their position is probably something insignificant
If you think I'm a bitch 'cause I probably mixed the game you kickin'
They be hollering hope I acknowledging
Because I have been methodically dropping the common knowledge
That I don't get down like that
Now they be houndin' a bitch, they'll probably get with a trick
Or a treat 'cause they dogs and they all gon' bark like that
I'm killing the game, killing the game, killing the game
So he feeling me, he want to bang I want to wait
So he get at me he want to say shit that make
Me think that he gone rape me If I don't stay
'Cause I got that sickening style, that built me a crowd
And men and women feelin' me now and it's freaking me out
'Cause I'm just here to figure it out and what this is about
But I'mma say it's getting so wild that it's tripping me out
'Cause I'm like here to kill the morale just kill all these sounds
But lately when I spit to a crowd, these men just reach out
And they tell me that they women is down, they gettin' aroused
And men be tryin' to give me they child, with a gin and a smile
They say they wanna (Fuck)"

So lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely
Yeah
When I came up,
I was famous
And I stayed up
Yeah
Now I'm way up
People they just
Turn to hater
(Verse 1 - Tech N9ne)
Been alone ever since I started
To be an artist
I've been disregarded
I mean the hardest they ever seen
I put them in the garbage to be a part of when I spit this
Whammy is wicked
Face covered up just like Stanley Ipkiss
But damn he is lifted were no families listed
Plan to revisit that big plan that he misses
But the land that he shifted, twisted a bit
'Cause man he resisted to jam when he script it
Calamity Insanity with it
Like amity preaches sickness hit when banisty livid
So Blow me, with a bucket of hot feces poured on me
Never loved it, now y'all just be so phoney
No Homies
Would I never let bozos with so-so flows own me
When it said it gets better it's just baloney
That's why N9nas so lonely
(Chorus - Mackenzie O'Guin and Tech N9ne)
So lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely
Yeah
When I came up,
I was famous
And I stayed up
Yeah
Now I'm way up
People they just
Turn to hater
(Verse 2 - Tech N9ne)
This my planet higher then yours, damn it
No laws and it's no raw candid inside I made them all vanish
Vandalistic with this
If man get his lips in this
Quick damage and rip the bitch
No bandages with a fit he draws panic
From clones I spit it up and then they gone
And I'm livin' it up within my zone
Nobody love to win my throne
Try calling home but everybody is so monotone
And your gettin' this while the Tech is all alone
(Verse 3 - Blind Fury)
Tech (Tech) Wait (Wait)
It's so Lonely up here (why)
Ain't none of my homies up here (oh)
'Cause they feel like I chose a career over my peers
But I try to tell them love don't pay bills
But me spittin' these frees and pre-writtens is probably what's gone make mills
Try to stay chill
When a lot of rappers lust and chase thrills
Fuck the fame and the thrills I'm maintaining the real
Straight up fury ain't no jury minus the chain and the grill
To me, you were lame if you ain't been embracing the skill
Ya see, 'cause I been in it, for a minute, and I ain't gonna go away
Y'all keep them trash rappers, but I'm the one that y'all throw away
Them songs I make will show the pain but this game ain't to friendly
I can't take it no more so sing it Mackenzie and tell em' why I'm
(Chorus - Mackenzie O'Guin and Tech N9ne)
So lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely
Yeah
When I came up,
I was famous
And I stayed up
Yeah
Now I'm way up
People they just
Turn to hater
(Verse 3 - Blind Fury)
Got everything that I wanted but it came with a price
Bought me a crib with my money, but I gave up my life
Sometimes I stay up kinda late, and I hate it at night
Every other day me and my lady we break up and fight
Thinkin' you bringing that mentality into my galaxy is a fallacy for anybody that battle me
Realizing I ain't got nothin' but friends and family
And after that ain't nobody else gonna look after me
So I'm proud to be

Premature, aww damn girl look what you made me do!
You make me wish I was fucking somebody else
So I can do you right (Do you, Do you right)
I'm working through the night (I'm working through the night)
Till the morning light
Than you want me to go inside
You make me wish I was fucking somebody else
So I can do you right (Do you, Do you right)
I'm working through the night (I'm working through the night)
Till the morning light
Than you want me to go inside
If I had a side piece
I could dump her something
Somebody else is wrong to jump in
Always think I'm up to something
Girl I'm only tryna function
You can't hear nothing when I'm talkin'
And you sayin' something
Put it in lame and same
That your brain just to explain
I can't stain when your gums is bumpin'
You keep on thinkin' I'm creepin'
Whenever I'm leavin' we beefin'
And I ain't done nothing wrong
My phone used to blow up on the reggie
Calmed it down a few you do the fool
Still actin' edgy
But I got something to calm you
When you be up at night
How's 'bout you play the plumbing?
And I come lay the pipe (Okay!)
Always talkin' 'bout something wrong
But I fix it real quick, didn't I?
Always singing that same old song
That there's another chick that I'm with
Get rid of her
Puttin' it down like I'm 'posed to do it
My phone ain't 'posed to view it
Something to say and I bet you spew it
It's like this everyday when we go through it
Than it's back to lovin' like we used to
We cool for a minute
Kali baby see right through ya
It's a fiendish plot
To make ya scream and stop
Whether I cheat or not
I wish I was loving somebody else
So you can either leave or not (Okay!)
You make me wish I was fucking somebody else
So I can do you right (Do you, Do you right)
I'm working through the night (I'm working through the night)
Till the morning light
Than you want me to go inside
You make me wish I was fucking somebody else
So I can do you right (Do you, Do you right)
I'm working through the night (I'm working through the night)
Till the morning light
Than you want me to go inside
Hey, you really make me wanna do
The things that I ain't 'posed to do
Wish I was lovin' on somebody else
Don't want nobody else, baby but you
You really make me wanna do
The things that I win't 'posed to do
Make me wish I was lovin' on somebody else
Don't want nobody else, baby but you
You really make me wanna do
The things that I ain't 'posed to do
And I wish I was lovin' on somebody else
Don't want nobody else, baby but you"

When I was young I used to wonder, why you lookin' at me?
'Cause I'm gifted I'm different, I still ask why? why you staring at me?
'Cause I'm something to see. ok, ok, now why?
Why you looking at me? 'cause I'm a weirdo, still though ill flow, and so.
Why you staring at me? 'cause I'm something to see.
(Tech)
They didn't stare much, before I fucked my hair up
In 11th grade, when I had bare nuts
And the principle told me to get a haircut
'Cause I was distractin kids, but when a nigga was rappin'
Chumps would flare up
'Cause I was dope and plus a sight to see,
Mighty twice exciting, the night sky thing, with dykes inticing
A sight, just the mic and me
I bring nice things when I write the fighting's, igniting
When a nigga wanna get up in the face of the spikes and see
'Cause I'm diff-erant diff-erant, trippin' is what this nigga want
This is when pistols get to clickin
The sick one hit the dump
On suckas I bring the chrome rukus
When I go, yeah I'm back niggas on this track making stacks, fat figures.
Even though strangers rap, we still cap pillaz
I'm miraculous, such an activist, I blast a bitch and cause disaster
If I'm deffinatly trip I'm smashing in shit.
(Kaliko)
Heart throb, never, black and ugly as ever
Black and shiny like pattent leather
However, I stay gucci down to the boots.
The booth is the only place I feel I got to tell the truth
Ok
It's like a gift and a curse
Me and people get funny looks from them first, then their women
When I'm traveling get the dip on their turf,
See what I'm working with then dip in their skirt
Ima bend em
They used to shake me off like I was dandruff
Now they want me in the middle, like the meat on their sandwich
Mr. two-tone, famous now that you grown, mr. getting to big for the city now that you blown.
Used to look at me like I was putting on a side show,
Now they know vitiligo, in every city I go
Still the funny lookin' fat kid on the inside
The difference is now a niggas world wide.
(Phenom)
Why do they stop and stare?
(???) On me
I'm still the same ole playa, that's all that I can be
'Cause when I ride through the hood these days
Niggas don't feel the same, 'cause when you turn your radio on
Your prolly gunna hear my name
Tell your bitch to pick her jaw off the floor
Shorty been gawkin and starin' and all since I walked in
Its prolly gunna be causin a problem
A nigga been watchin and jockin hard and licking her chops
And she's looking at me like a piece of meat she's fittin devour
Now I'm a sensible fella, never have I been a sucka
That's why I'm gone kick the bucket, before a hoe game I trust
Because all the same hoes who ain't ever paid me no nevermind
Is all trying to perform a horizontal grind in this bed of mine
'Cause they know I'm from another time, I'm ahead of mine
And I'm fittin to blow off all the rhyms from this head of mine
Another nigga ill as me, please you will never find,
Someone on my level I'm not yet even in my prime
Uh, they used to act like they never seen me
Now the same haters looking at me like they never seen me
Yeah and if your girlfriend ain't never seen me
Better handcuff her might dead her if you let her see me
Phenom!"

When I got at the top and they made him pretty hot
'Cause he knowin' that Tecca Ninna's a dirty chopper
He's handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hovering having hella go H.A.M. though?
I said to Seven, ""Richie Havens'll be the man""
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, 'cause he be the guest spot

So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin' so let's rock, nigga

Yes, I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling - you're gone!
Nobody can catch up meetin' Speedy Gonzales
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I've got to audibly body them
This is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em

It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em

They never heard of us, but look at 'em turnin' up
I slap the shirt off a super simpleton makin' 'em be impotent
And when I be flippin', niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast or I'll smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstacy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in Vic's
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after tonight
I'm grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
Cause that's what it's like and attackin' it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in a backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being pinned to the side
Of a semi fended beside a friend of the guy's wife Brenda
The flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina
'Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as slick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
You've been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity
That I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way to make 'em picket
I pick a day to be a prick then I'm picking the wickedest shit to say
Spit it back on a level, incredible, head full of Red Bull, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
And I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak, and coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take, like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition replenished, the Punisher
With his gun insured, hundred words
And a clip, other words motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the...

Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Wanna get down, in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down

Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit

After me it's 5, 4, 3, and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin'
So I tell them all to put that on somethin'
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Yeah, I guess I'm supposed to come with that fast flow
Woo! I guess I'm supposed to come with that gas flow
But no, I'ma just spit it, I'ma get it good
Wish you would tell me what I should do
I don't know, hit the door
Uh, yeah, feel like I been here before
Maybe I have but I can't fuck with it
Hit 'em with a semiautomatic, watch 'em duck with it
Speaking on lyrical ability
Everyone in my vicinity blowing they mind like Kennedy
I got no love for the enemy, somebody tell me the remedy
I'm like what's good, been fine
Tell me what's on your mind, rewind this shit
My message is beyond this shit
I put that on everything, I'm just being honest, shit
So what's up, hold up
Tech I'm sorry for the hold up but I been on the road
Should have had this verse to your ass a long time ago
When I put that on everything, I ain't had a minute to myself
But I been living like I ain't finna see tomorrow
I'm ain't focused on no wealth
I been living good, I been feeling fine
Pass the sriracha, I put that shit on all of mine
Busting like Columbine combined with a terrorist's mind
That's been confined in four walls for some time
They say I'm the best at what I do
After me it's 5, 4, 3, and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin'
So I tell them all to put that on somethin'
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, the flavor popper
We gotcha, even haters jock us
These choppers invade the knockers then blocker
Disintegrating every chakra eager to off ya
You can bet that we doin' it proper
When I put the bullets in a fully with a hoodie
Ain't nobody gonna stop us
Ain't nobody gonna stop us, nobody gon' top us
We leave 'em with no option, leave 'em with no conscience
Leave 'em with no oxygen, leave 'em with no problem
And even though I could see what they watchin'
TV with a DVD, I can repeat
When I see these street shockin'
Easy if it need be then I just eat beats
And I'm Easy-E, Compton
I eat meat like I'm EBT shopping
Credit Card Max, bend the bars back
Fuck your hoe, get brain and all that
Run in your house and bring your whore back
Sever your face and dead the doormat
Who got the keys to the rented Corvette
Can't catch me, I'm the man in all black
I been a nice chap since Catman on crack
Fuck that, I been nice way before that
Can't ignore that, you can try though
But you gon' end up next to God though
I'm that pen that wrote the Bible
I'm on your skin like vitiligo
Sing for the moment, I hit the high note
Someone please let Elton John know
Tell the lieutenant I'm Hect Camacho
With a Catholic priest and the Pentecostal
Why you niggas wiggidy wiggidy wack, gettidy get in the back
With a umbilical patch, jump in the middle of the track
None of y'all niggas can act so y'all niggas are packed
Come and get it again, fuckin' a bitch in the whip
Give me your moment to fall, I'm gonna fit in the car
I can do better than yours, I can be ready to brawl
I can be shattered and all, nobody want to be hard
Better be ready for war, tell me who ready for more
Joyner
They say I'm the best at what I do
After me it's 5, 4, 3, and 2
Sometime I think they all gum bumpin'
So I tell them all to put that on somethin'
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything
Sriracha, I put that on everything

(You know that there are billions of stars in the universe)
But the star had quite a difficult time shining amongst all the other stars
The year was 1994 when the star began his decent
And continued falling... and falling
Landing in an unknown place the star creates followers from underground
And the quest to shoot beyond the stars once again
(Verse 1 - Tech N9ne)
Ground zero crowned hero,
But ain't nobody ever heard the sound before I found me so competitive I
Never get the credit but get it when they was clownin lejo
Now we pro the brown people
Was on it for the moment what they frownin me for
Layin what I was sayin' didn't sound negro now people round me low down when
The beat go
Never will I ever stop or quit what I'm doin' I'm gettin' better even cleverer
I can hit then I ruin every competitor we et 'em poppin' shit I be chewin em
Up ahead of ya et cetera
Speed band is comin' for ya now he's makin' the industry sandwich come enjoy
The flow with tech and the minasee damage gunnin boy ya know we shakin the
Finicky planet we've landed
(Chorus - Krizz Kaliko)
We've landed, the stars have fallen from the heavens
Your thoughts will reign on this planet
The arts you paint on this canvas, your helpless
We've landed, the hearts of fans have been branded
The dark of sixes and sevens
Is the start of musical madness
We've landed
(Verse 2 - Tech N9ne)
Shootin for the stars lootin for the cars whos inducin pukin hootin for the
Bars
You get stupid groups of loosin juicin you for true but you recruit the
Youth ignore bizarre niggas
But ain't nobody fuckin' with any of our niggas
And if you trippin' under the Tecca there are millas
You don't wanna fuck with the murderers gorrila war till the lord hit us
Scar nigga what?
Bitch I'm at the bottom and I'm comin' to get at ya better get up in ya column
And I'm gonna diminish you when I spit I really gotta right in front of me
Timid, and I wanna present it
'Cause I fought for everything I got it was not handed and nobody fed a
Nigga nothin' when I was famished I'm bussin for life but not for nothin' but
God damnit notice somethin' beautiful just landed
(Chorus - Krizz Kaliko)
We've landed, the stars have fallen from the heavens
Your thoughts will reign on this planet
The arts you paint on this canvas, your helpless
We've landed, the hearts of fans have been branded
The dark of sixes and sevens
Is the start of musical madness
We've landed
(Verse 3 - Tech N9ne)
I land at six feet under six feet
But every other ordinary people can't sleep
The badness we had dished back in high school classes, ya dealin' with three
Faces of madness
Never been average with the image of a savage at the very bottom I'm livin'
Under the maggots
But I'm bout to shoot 'em and really wake up the masses gas it an blast it
Have the upper class breakin asses
Upper class rapper, suckers ass packers, rougher tougher mothafucker spaz
Backwards
Kcuf natas (fuck Satan) gutter mash slacker
Tecca ninas what there lads after
Everybody don't wanna say what goes up
Better quit movin I know its bout to blow up
Thinkin' when I hit the stars I'ma slow up hold up

I am doing what the sick does
Takin' anything to get buzzed
'Stead of eatin wit the family I rather get my dinner in a strip club
Not a evil that can rival me becoming even darker than a crip slug comin' to clip bloods,
Took the gentleman and put him underground like in Dig Dug
So long every day shit there's no hope for we
Repetition kept us glitchin', your folks bore me
I'm turning into what my lady provoked for she never really knew inside of my brain having ho soaked orgies, constantly
Do you really wanna see that things that's turning in me?
Turning in me? NO!

I didn't do it, got something to stir it up
I am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn
I couldn't see it, the hatred that's filling me
Migraine, I'm bane, ain't nobody feelin' my pain
Stupid women I blame so goodbye sane imma fry my brain! Drugs imma try aim to deny shame and defy thy rain
Look into my eye mane I wanna fly gettin' really high and die strange
How do I describe, you and I entropy, inside of me an entity
Turning me into to the portion of idenitity
That you'll never know there, till my anger make a slow tear
Any beef wanna grow, I swear I eat it so rare, baby oh yeah
That off your bitchness that hate oh so it's just
Turning me into the insane, playing all kind of sin games
Taking it in like a ganja hit, you're the reason why the bomb was lit
Got me thinking ""murder everything in sight"", monster shit!

All of these haters travel the world major, a lager
I been dope, a lemur, I'm battlin' makin' them non-say believers
Scribble and dabble to get up out of beneath
Smellin' me out and then give it to the people, I'm lethal
It's like my life so don't rant, spittin' the venom I know it don't stank
Can you smell that, Mr. Miyagi I make 'em run and tell that
Go inhale that

Together we are,
A powerful force,
As one, mind, body and soul.
Let no evil enter nor attempt to reduce because of the beliefs we hold,
And with this love, combined with our strength,
We ward off pain and stress.
Technician I am, wholeheartedly, in life and in death.

With a problem in a incubator

Never need the shaker the beef from table,

Now you're the beast awaiting her,
I don't think the streets are safer!
My misery seepin' through my delivery,
Bitter we givers and they keep my figures don't try to nigger me.
The grave digger is hither he is no kidder see,
Consider the dark energy, sinner be inner me!
Black diamonds all around clawin all, they're down,
Definites who saw the clown,
And now steppin' with that tall amount of big Tech and shit.

Flip the sick or plain out relate
Damned and incredible straight out the gate!

All you fraudulents feeling I'm falling offending the father
I place you in the deepest darkest part of abyss
Nobody but you without any food and no aqua

Sack in the dungeons and ditches

Because they sons and daughters wanna be martyrs

I'm appalled that y'all want me to fall callin craps
Suckers hate it now they crawlin' back
'Cause I'm tall as Shaq
And I'm always up for brawlin' bats

Where am I?
You don't know where you are?
No I don't
You're in strange land
Strangeland?
Ya, Strange Land
Woh, how did I get here?
Well that's simple Mister Yates
What do you mean?
Your the creator.
(Tech N9ne Verse I)
What I saw was amazin after raisin up and gazin at the babies that I'm creatin' nights and days pavin
The way for ragin techaholics makin' havens next to all this hate and crazin death we call it a place of consummation
Of perfection fulfillment the Tech runs the buildin respect ones resilience from threats guns and illnesses
This place is realness it feels as its lifted amid sick and twisted and real wicked villages
And I'm the main man
That made every effort to gain fans
Through all my pain I obtain grands
Millions just because of my brain now my lane stands insane (rants?) the name brand call it strangeland.
Gettin' paid was the game plan
But the lane transformed to untamed fans enhanced in the strangeland
(Killing up in the)
Bane and insane land
(Breakin up in the)
Strange land, where everyone know my name man
'Cause my blood and veins ran through the main land I am in the strangeland
(Killin' up in the)
Bane and insane land
(Breakin up in the)
Strangeland
[[[Tech N9ne]] Verse II]
A world filled with technicians lets this one stress lifting mesh kids and sets with them tech listening vets
Expression is best written less hidden flesh women sex driven that's livin' yes been impressed
By the way that tech is blessin em
It show 'cause the land it steady grows
And I'm the man with feddy flows
But understand he says he knows
That he ran a deadly road
But he woke up with a family rose
In a land of uncanny souls
And they adore him
Even if they can't afford him
Be the rich and be the poor
Then really get to be before him
To get laced on mistakes and big breaks
Quick paced lyrics they pick in this place
(??)
He played me some stuff on the ugg, in la, off the Carter 4, he has, he has a record on there with this dude named tech n9ne, I don't know if you heard of him... its crazy, its crazy.
(Tech N9ne Verse III)
Am I in the twilight zone
Cause my mic's on but I never thought the world'd buy my songs
Cause in my land I'm the highlight inside my dome
But now it's my hype they try bite cause my life long
In this hip hop everybody's lip drops when I spit the gift it quickly shifted 'cause I get props its terrific
They recognizing me on every level if you missed it
If you look you findin me and the very rebel this is listed
Tech N9ne a insane man
His own lane had to strain in pain and that became fan
When all the dames glance he's doin' the rain dance
Because the whole world is bout to be a strangeland
(???)
And the Left Field Woody go's to...

Hmm, Tech N9ne!
Smashes, the masses, but the industry's hatin' asses
Strange days, when your favorite rapper's popping
But is he on top of something you can't gauge
Especially when he's topping the charts
And you see me, K. Lamar, and Macklemore sharin' the same stage
I'm the nigga all these artists look up to
Yes, the Tech has been the hardest to bust through
But I keep my fans fiendin' like clucks do
You don't like how we live it, well...
I dominate, your conglomerate, what a beating I can accommodate
It'll be a non-debate, coming up against Aaron the Great
So many got arms, legs and necks tatted
Strange cause Music show conceptually I'm the best at it
Let's have it, for all of these Tech addicts
Any disrespect to family will get your chest gatted
Aimin' at 'em and its agony
Burner blew his brain in, back and these
Cannons came in, caved in cavity, caliber, connect, cap it
Yo, there it go
Red is in my head, it grow
Headed fo'
Let em, dead it, yeah the medic, said it so
Let it grow
Shred it and get no credit
So pathetic though
Dreading that it steppin' in heaven's crevice, wettin' edible
Give her the shivers when I deliver this
Hit her then quit her 'cause she's on Twitter shit
And when she compare me to Eminem I said
I'm different, she said how, I said I'm black and I can say nigger bitch!
To him I may just be another bro with a flow
Will probably never tour cause it'll be thousands of Juggalos at a show
And I heard fatalities happen on each side
So there's never no let it go
So I get it, I keep what I'm makin' incredible
All of them scared of a nigga tho
Strangeulation, this occupations so scand'lous
We stopped the hatin', no chances
When I rock the nation so damn sick
I'm killing all these niggas
Operation Code Kansas
Strange gang playin' triggered assassins
Got a bunch of untamed, aim, trained spitters are blastin'
My insane brain sayin' give up the rappin'
And go back to the gang bang thang, nigga what's ha'ennin', so-woo"

Prayin' that 12-12 for hell
Felon to sell and slept on a bed of nails like nothing I've ever felt
Ghost in a shell, was molded with other demons as
If I needed some help or a host to preserve the heathen
Got it, my brain is rotted
I swear to God that I'm not it
I'm set to go to the gallow as soon as the rope is knotted
I ain't high as the fire and I have unused adrenaline
Came in the cypher clean, still smelling like putrid cinnamon
Then I'm in, enemy of the state, I'm straight at an angle
Stop risking and quit your bitchin', it ain't like I'm raping an Angel
Said I was magnifique, y'all fuckin' with it, kapeesh
Stevie Stone I'm on it I'm so clever
Nobody comparing 'em better
I put shit together
America's most elaborated rap pick yo head up
Small talkin' to get you wet up
Yeah, I'm will to kill all you niggas
The feelin', adrenaline that'll spillin' a milli yeah I mill' all you niggas
Ain't even reach out they climax rather my sillin' on niggas
And backin' a back on back can't billy you niggas
Get busy on niggas
This ain't no random some leekage
Stonie in the building the bitches pull out their cleavage
The snake and the bat you see them prominent features
The spieces
Strangeland we rain on your region
Meatwagon I come I be taggin' 'em
Baggin' 'em bring 'em clusters of three
Got three magnums gaggin' 'em out
You pussies is still talkin' I'm draggin' 'em out
I'm tappin' 'em out
Aww shit, they fucked around and signed a backpacker
Smart, rich, handsome, plus he's not a bad rapper
I'm just a little local talent that fucked around and made it big
Underground bully, pickin' on all these famous kids
And the danger is, Now I'm doin' Strange a biz?
About to make the world forget about what a major is
Independent Powerhouse, running all these cowards out
My enemies are all forgotten, wishin' I would shout 'em out
And I don't want to hear a rapper harmonize unless
He thuggish, ruggish, Lazy, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish or Flesh
But maybe I'm just hatin' 'cause my black ass could never sing
Fuck that autotune I hope the Futures filled with better things
And you a fucking liar if you say you found a better team
Impossible! Like trying to fit my dick inside my wedding ring
And all the bread it brings will be distributed and properly
I represent for hip hop not some fucking aristocracy
I'm the Martin Scorsese of rap, rap predator
Better than severin' the reverend with a jackknife
Kevin and eleven of 'em revvin' up the engines we bubblin' up like 7-Up
Then when we shoot that shit we eat that shit for din--din-ner
I don't need no fuckin' ""Ok"", are you serious, I'm okay
I'mma make you bleed like it's your period, period
I eat period pussy so eating you ain't serious
What you need for me to flip that shit and rip that shit
Like a skitzo stick that shit, that shit like a automatic pistol grip
No, I created this fast rap, I'm past that
I put a gat in that asscrack and blast that
I'm light years ahead of 'em, might use the head of 'em
I lose, then you can keep the breadcrumb
My nigga I'm a carnivore, ready for any kind of war, any kind of score"

Up from my whiskers, down to my fuckin' kicks
Wreck-O was echoed in Gordon Geckos
You suckin' dick
Nobody be askin' me for secrets
I ain't chuckin' tips
I'd rather be bumpin' hips
On that ratchet with muffin tits
Tore up the limits
From Britan visions would rock their lives
Inside a prison where giddy bitches don't jock the rhyme
Born in precision
Rhythm spittin' could swat a fly
For them to just kick a single shillings from Spotify
Bye, Bye killers
On a high five business
Gonna ride by the sickest
In your high ride to the hitlist
If we ain't spoke in ages
Then miss me with broken favors
You Miley Cyrus to majors
You twerkin' on swollen razors (run now)
Don't make me come to dinnernail your tongue down
And have you plead your case to us
At Strangeland at sundown
Be careful of the biz
Cause everything has got a price attached
Wake up with a horse head in your bed
And next your life is snatched
Tank full of petro
Bank full of pesos
Pull on my tour bus
Bonus on a payroll
Feel like I be killin' it
Famous on the internet
Really I'm just wingin' it
Cookin' shit on my Kitchenett
Life so good
Right now I need to celebrate
Bout to sell a stadium out
And turn it into rake
Look at how the industry norm
Has started lookin' Strange
All my brothers riding the storm
While they just ride the waves
Caviar wishes
Bitches for my bitches
Black shades and hoodies
And spots and white linens
Feel like Sam Kinison
Preachin' to these citizens
Screamin' at the saints
You ain't ever gonna get rid of us
Guessin' that I just cleaned my plate
So now I'm gettin' cake
Speedin' down the interstate
Yellin' get out the fuckin' way
We plant flags in the ground
Because we here to stay
And bring my whole hood out
And have my own parade
(Black Gold!)
I purposely wrote this verse
Just to murder this
Member defecate
Disassemble the limbs
Of a nigga who try and separate
Artistry from nonfiction
I'm sent with a conviction
To sentence you pons
Givin' the benz on my diction
There he goes
Speakin' bout how he murk a beat
Smellin' himself
Why else would he flaunt about it so verbally
Dance around me
Like I was a paraplegic
In a doo-cee-doo competition
Lookin' pissed like I never heard of feet
Yadda Yadda
A whole lotta yappin'
About my rappin'
When I'm the captain
Of crunchin' you niggas milky dreams
I'm the comparison of Pac's face
Staring in your face
Mock razor blades cut
Leave you crispy clean
Don't ask Tech
Ask me if it's questions
Guarantee that he tell you
That I'm the best
And I'm destened
To find a snake and a bat
Helpin' Kansas City's progression
Hopin' I hurt the feelings
Of whoever second guessed it
Cause everybody talkin'
Imma make you niggas hear me
Mind control flow
Now listen to your ears bleed
Spit it sicker than these sicker fans
Keep your dick up in your pants
You were blunted on the block
Me, I had some different plans
I'm trying to get to France
Sniffing grams
Hit a branch
Independent Powerhouse
Vibin' out with the fam
Waking up in different cities
Every night hittin' grants
Stay prepared for this
I'm bearing witness to this sinner man
Stripper dance with cinnamon
Clubbin' with my gentelman
Drink away the nights events
Nothing worth remembering
Squad will run up in this bitch
Mobbin' like some immigrants
Jack you for your paper stack
Rob you of your innocence
Taping of the scene of crimes
Swabbing for my fingerprints
Thought about my life
You thought the same
And couldn't think of shit (Ha!)
This type of fire don't extinguish
Now write about some bigger shit
You're striking out
Swing and miss
Ring around the rosy homie
Pocket full of pain
I got a lock up on my lane
And triple optic in my brain, look"
335,Strangeulation IV,2014,Strangeulation (2014),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"I'm too hot to cool off
Blew Atlanta up like Eric Rudolph
Starving in pursuit of moot law
Flossing, get your coo raw
My crew'll shoot at you like ""hoorah""
I be on tour and shit, you get on stage and you get boo'd off
You throwing jabs at me but we ain't in no boxing gym
I stab 'em and have them inside of a hospital hooked up to oxygen
So who the hottest, conversation my name get brought up in
I'm Woody Harrison, this industry is Zombieland
You wanna fuck with us, you must've had no common sense
I'll kill you then your guts get eaten up by Brotha Lynch
It's Strange Music so the competition nonexistent
All them other record labels fallen off like rotten limbs
I'm making some money, it's making my stomach cringe
I'll never forget it a couple of summers ago I was cooking and scrubbing pans
Drink till I get ruckus-spinned
Puffing something with a lovely scent behind the cutless tint
Floating in the Strange stream, who jumpin' in?
My brain is full of thoughts that are darker than Samhain
That span across the Great Lakes and vast Midwest Plains
Spreading coast to coast like a virus you can't contain
Now a global pandemic, panic courtesy of (Strange!)
The biggest independent label popped a champagne
We don't need no head now, homie you can keep the change
Coming through your speakers, receive us into your blood vein
We the truth like Nostradamus' prophecy quatrains
Snake Bat, Praise that, part of rap since way back
Since the days of 8 tracks and 808's and adats
Analog cassette decks, steady grinding, what's next?
Starving artist till Trav and Tech cut me that advanced check
Strange outcast step child, call me Damien
Five Finger Death Punch straight to the cranium
Flow so sick, could be enriched with uranium
Extraterrestrial, lyrics labeled alien
Appetite destruction, never been no punk shit
My voices give me choices, just despite that I choose dumb shit
Choppers all around me, I mean lyrical and literal
Spit it through this microphone and pull up at your Mami's home
Jump out on the dumb shit, speaking through this drum clip
Tearin' flesh, rippin' hips, watch me kill shit
Cypher without the villain, that's appealin' but it's silly though
An army without it's general, an octopi no tentacles
I'm trying to be subliminal, nothing I do is minimal
Heavy hitter, heavy words
Push a nigga, pushin' verbs
Squish my button, you push my nerves
Ten toes in the turf
Not the last or the first
Gut a nigga, stump the Earth
Grippin' metal, I ain't special
On the level, smack your temple with the barrel
Not complying, I'm a rebel
And I'm fresh up out the ghetto, puppet master I'm Geppetto
Take a minute, you'll get it
Nigga Scoob did it. (Yeah)
Cali baby!
'Ight man Ima do this!
I'm kinda nervous
The purpose of having a cypher is so you can sit here wide-eyed
Listen look at me in this position
Now I coulda just left you sitting there
But Nina told me to pick 'em apart you're a victim of art
K-R-I to the double crooked, look at him he pudgy like they
Took an ugly stick and frickin' shook at him, (Okay)
And I don't stay gucci down to the linens
I'll let you trick off, she jerking my dick off and grinnin'
You can see him, but he just a figment
You wanna be better, get your pigment gone
Try to beat him with deliverin', I get belligerent
And that's the end of the song
And I get a little bit ahead of myself
Feel like I'm on L, and I feel like I'm better than everyone else
I guess I be rappin' ahead of my wealth
I'm the coldest thing since the ice cube
Only thing missing from this beat back in the day was Ice Cube (Okay)
Yeah I said I'm the best in it, Nigga what?
Only niggas that could contest it is rested, dig 'em up!
(Okay! Hahaha whatever nigga.)"

Picture me
In a casket
Blasted
Never nobody
Knew how long
The pain lasted
Keep my eyes tight
I'm frightened
But I fights like Tyson
When playin' this game of life
I'm losing
Longing to be enlightened
Absorb my mind state
Reduce the crime rate
And take me out
When running toward the Lord
I see 'em fake me
Out shook me
So from church I play hookie
Listen to the words of a brother
The sick stutters
So you better better
Get the get the bags ready
Comes a killer killer
Like Skagnetti
My brains contaminated
Hella rotten
Wasn't me that killed you
Who was it what was it
The effects of the mildew
My brain's wilted
In my eyes the world is a bit tilted
Lord take me away
Before somebody else gets killed
Blood spilled

This is the letter to my homies

But I didn't listen

Through the rain, snow and thunder
Foul ups, bleeps and blunders
But no man shall tear asunder
Is what you said
You should've put multi bullets
In my head
When you found that evil
Instinct was a song
Where the events actually went on
This is the letter

Sensation was given to me from my homegirl Shell
Told me, since I was in pain and I like 2 rebel
This Motorola I'm giving you will suit you real well
10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes feelin' funny butterflies
My eyes dilate another size overwhelming sense of love
Got this nut so sprung
Walk up to a stranger baby, can I suck your tongue
Tingling baby got me feeling like mingling baby
This is a hella higher learning than singleton baby
One minute I'm cold next one I'm heat
Get me some, big red so I don't grind my teeth
This is deep I take another one and another one
And another one, uh oh here comes the other ones,
I'm stimulated man I'm hella blown away
And all the problems that I had have all gone away.
I pop another pill and Imma take a sip of Caribou to wash it down
Ya thinkin' Imma overdose, I never had a moment that'll turn a nigga round
I really wanna give you what I got up in my dickies in the bed I wanna start
I feel I wanna fuck you but my dick is really numb and I don't see me getting hard
She told me take this cap of G.H.B. with a gulp of Mountain Dew
With glee so I can possibly end my existence
G.H.B. ain't no need 4 resistance, extacy
Yeah, X.T.C. (I love you very much) (repeat 3 times)
G.H.B., shrooms and weed
This is the Tech N9NE experience
Yeah A.C.I.D. (I love you very much) (repeat 3 times)
P.C.P., Carabou leez
This is the Tech N9NE experience
I'm on 5 pills and a cap of date rape one caraboulou
And it ain't even late, great
I feel good; let's go to the x house
That's where Heather and Margie got everybody x'ed out
Walk in the crib, my homegirl say Tech's with me
'Cause she know all the bitches wanna get next to me
Imma star and ladies wanna have sex with me
But the bitches still get jealous off of extacy.
It's like 30 people in the house
Rave bitches messaging glow sticks in the mouth
I take another cap of G. with my Mountain Dew
In higher than the top floor at the Fountain Bleu
Somebody said they got the chronic light it up man
Let's smoke it all till we fall then get up again
I wanna fuck but I'm numb 'cause I'm thizzled up
Skip to the lou I try to piss dick is shriveled up
My nigga Kutt got the blunt nigga pass it
I didn't even know you was here so
He passed it with a couple hits of acid
Like I refuse to stay alive, it's pills and mo thrills
I'm lucky if I survive; I'm high
Dipped out the x house it's right around two
Off to Westport to kick it with the Hurricane crew
Saw my niggas C & G after party at the room
My homegirl Ieasha slid me a couple grams of shrooms
Damn, it don't stop embassy suites 3 o'clock
With my niggas C & G, they got hella G. & E.
I get two mo hits of that X.T.C. shit
I don't wanna come down off that X.T.C. trip
Bitches, in the room lookin' so fresh so clean a couple
Hella high panties and bra no jeans
My nigga said that he got codeine
Mixed it with cherry Robitussin and juice I took a sip of his lean
In the bathroom to bust a shit
I couldn't do it so my bitch came to suck the dick
It was hard and soft but hard enough to penetrate the slit
Bout 20 minutes damn near fainted when it was time to spit
5 o'clock in the morning and we still zoned
7 o'clock in the morning pill is still on
This life I live I might not die if let lone
Love my experience this is my fucked up life
Don't try this at home"

343,Technicians,2011,All 6's and 7's (2011),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"EST is 1985,
In KC on a bus ride,
From the 56th side,
Not too many knew that it was alive,
But they spread it so now they tied to Technicians worldwide.
Listen!
Trying to recruit is the mission,
We offer you a position,
Where Tech will rule and condition your brain.
To know actin' a fool is the vision,
Caribou Lou is tradition,
And the way to be true to your living is strange.
We come in peace,
But if you wanna be dumb and beef,
A gun is somethin' he wanna be young and speak,
Imma numb his beak.
He's a woman, he the one and brung in meat for the cunning beast.
Hit a lung and, seep dung, and sleep long in deep tongue, full of gum and teeth.
It's when a Technician do the sets who diss the crew,
The best thing for you to do,
Is to let the clique see who the vet is, and miss the new seekers,
Wondering who the fuck is coming through these speakers.
Never forget it the medic for you tweakers,
Ahead of the medicine developed to soothe creatures,
You're pathetic if you're no believer,
'Cause we all are energetic and eager.
Come alive when you walking side by side with me.
Fly the skies and get high with me.
On this ride you won't collide,
Just confide in me,
Try denying me,
Ye dying violently.
That's the way,
You fakers got to pay,
My people quick to spray,
And buck a demon till they lay,
But if he breathing it musta been an angel by his side like Sunday,
Never would be the case 'cause my clique ready to ride when I say:
Technicians!
Owoh! Owoh! Owoh!
Others ain't got a clue,
They comin' through,
Suspicion.
We do,
The Shit,
We do,
'Cause if you not with the crew,
Converting you is our mission.
If you're a born Technician,
Put your ammunition,
And your hands up in the sky.
This is a strong addiction,
Live to this if ya a Technician till ya die.
My people all know what a Bianca is,
Most of 'em want to diss,
Don't come unless you don't want the biz.
It ain't nothin' but real women in my circle, not them phony chicks,
That don't know what I mean when I say elbow macaroni bitch.
They know what I'm drinking,
The ladies looking right,
They know what I'm thinking,
The babies even hype,
The oldies be geekin',
The red, the black, and white,
The soldiers beef seekin'.
All of my people's here,
Tech and the bidness
Are gonna equal fear.
'Cause I'm 'bout to bubble,
And get the evil peers,
Out of my life I never wanna see you,
Yeah!
Bitch.
You ain't a Technician,
You don't know the pledge,
But you said that you listen,
Guess you misunderstood the Shit huh?
Disrespect that Tech trick get done.
The moral of the story is we warriors,
Notorious for the hordes of core,
Ready to roar he is glorious.
Technician number 1,
The Mission leave 'em sprung,
With the tongue,
And if you listen it's a gun.
Technicians!
Owoh! Owoh! Owoh!
Others ain't got a clue,
They comin' through,
Suspicion.
We do,
The Shit,
We do,
'Cause if you not with the crew,
Converting you is our mission.
If you're a born Technician,
Put your ammunition,
And your hands up in the sky.
This is a strong addiction,
Live to this if ya a Technician till ya die.
We are family,
That Tech shit we on it.
We could be damaging.
To all you punks that want it.
We bring calamity,
That's thinking bad we flaunt it.
Unforgettable,
Tech's formidable,
Reppin' the minimal,
Bitch we run it.
You don't gotta know that I really meant it when I said that I was gonna make the mainstream go me.
Still rappin' like I'm poppin' a pillow,
Off of the killer,
More like I was taking Molly in '03.
We can take anybody we so deep.
I bet that you got us on yo' street.
I'm tryna find a spot that's big enough,
So that all of my people can meet!
Technicians!
Owoh! Owoh! Owoh!
Others ain't got a clue,
They comin' through,
Suspicion.
We do,
The Shit,
We do,
'Cause if you not with the crew,
Converting you is our mission.

But now I'm breaded though

I'm thankful, that all my blemishes never made you suspicious

To stop em' that a man to stand up even add a camera
They won't be James Holmes, and they won't be Adam Lanza
A John Malvo, I'll flow loud for my child though
Ain't raising no groucho evil out my house yo
Instead a me watching em' disappear in the night
Air em' at graduation saying that's my kid right there
I proudly claim my love,
The futures born from my own flesh and blood,
All that matters, this time,
So prayers that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine,
To my unborn I give my all so you could ball like I could,
Stay in school and play it smooth and do those things that I wouldn't,
Pay attention and keep your distance from ignorant instances,
Play a instrument anything that you want just invision it,
Follow your dreams, no matter what may come or what may fall,
Cause' ain't no shame in failing as long as you know you gave your all,
Staned up, man up, get a handle on yourself tighten your belt,
Do what you can to do for you and y'all just don't, do it for the wealth that they offer
It sounds awful but if me and your mama' ain't talking,
And she said that I ain't offering a call just as often as I should,
I pray that you get older and you understand that I was just, doing what I could,
If she let me, if you have a second I could explain,
Like so many transitions in life that people change,
Whether I'm on top soil, or dead in a box,
I love you dearly sincerely and that'll never stop,
For my kid...
For my kid...
I proudly claim my love,
The futures born from my own flesh and blood,
All that matters, this time,
So prayers that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine,
Paris and Darius Dariana Unique Oshay Malik,
And one on the way in a matter of weeks,
But it's a shame cause' I think that my other daughter ain't mine,
Andria baby I love you I guess your father was blind,
In due time you'll understand it, how your mama' was scandelous,
(Wait this don't seem right man, I don't think I can handle it,)
When I all I ever did was show love for you,
Sweated blood for you, any moment take a slug for you,
But it's cool, the baby mama drama is expected,
And that karma is going to be what I been blessed with
Sit back and learn your lessons as our seeds grow from kids to adolescence,
Then present you for yourself as misdirection,
The first to heed the message is Malik,
Abandonded by his mama' on thanksgiving evening,
Bout' three years ago was up to me to feed to 'em morals,
Values manhood, knowledge a week ago he graduated
You ask me, then I'm a' say.
I proudly claim my love,
The futures born from my own flesh and blood,
All that matters, this time,
So prayers that the sun will always shine
On that sweet child of my mine"

And just when they thought that everything was peachy keen
Somewhere deep within the shadows
There were other things to be seen
An untamable beast with the urge to feast
And only alone would he stand, the culprit of fear on the 67th tear
There lies, the Boogieman.
No introduction needed
N9ne times you must repeat it
Mind trying just delete it
I'm N9ne's rush to be this rough MC
Who's gluttony would rhyme grime
Trust believe it
A legend ever since the projects
An odd Tech would get respect when he wreck the set
But never get the props that was god blessed
So this is me, never let the prod rest
The object of rawness dejectin' steps to darkness
Led to the industry whispering the name
History became a mystery
Cause listeners in the game
Wish to sing the same
Riffs cerebral glitch will lead to lane
And this will be your pit
For me to split then bleed your brain
They heard the name
But can't put a face to it, oh what a shame
When he rains
In the wood he stands still, he turn to lanes
From sane to straight wicked, don't tell me you ain't heard the saying
The Boogieman's real
He's underneath your bed
Trapped inside your head
You tried to fight it
But you decided it's just that
Boogieman
We fear what we can't see
This web's a tangled weave
Of life designed to try and blind you
From that Boogieman
And in that voice your hear
'Eliminate your fears'
What do you do?
Discover the truth
That it's The Boogieman
And now you know it's real
And everything you feel
Hits you again, you will stand
Face-to-face with that Boogieman
They don't wanna have to try to do as I do
That's probably why it ain't been easy for me to slide through
I chew rappers up, on stage and mics they by-flew,
Out with the ravens, flight to hatin', haven lies you
'Cause you don't want change
And you don't want Strange,
Rearranging the main lanes to brain games from plain jane
That's when your fames Strange
And you can maintain
You think you sang such an insane rain, same thang
And I'm the shadow in the dark
That came for battlin in the park
And they skidaddled when I barked
That give a rattle to their hearts
'Cause they're afraid they will all fail
Darkness will prevail
The Boogieman is not a tall tail
What a tough act to follow
You afraid? Tell me are ya?
When this came you were nada
Tell your lane sayonara
(The Boogieman, the Boogieman)
He's underneath your bed
Trapped inside your head
You tried to fight it
But you decided it's just that
Boogieman
We fear what we can't see

With a deep and cloudy ocean, I'm in

The goad is really croakin', within
Thought I was superman the truth was
I used to be clean as a loofah and I used the
Cool devoured the booze to hand I lose the
Land if I triple booze the fans
I dream of stoppin' but greed is knockin'

Proceed with caution, heat exhaustion
If I keep it goin' I'm gonna need a coffin
Forever takes me away
And I've fallen from grace
Tell them I've tried to wait
But they're too late
I can see when this pain will fade
Oh god heaven is callin' my name
I feel that pain comin' from inside
My people had the same drinkin' and then died
Devil in my brain I'm sinkin' within pride
Drinkin' for lunch and I'm drinkin' for dinner
I'm nothin' but lush when I'm pushin' up in her
I seldom remember the 8th of November
'Cause I be goin' so hard I'm always on a bender
I got money, I got cash
So picture unlimited amounts I got stash
When it got bad I went out and got trashed
When I hit glad what'chyo think's in my glass
I gotta catch me, I'm fallin'
Not a limit to a young brother ballin'
Gotta let go of the weight I'm haulin'
When I look in the mirror within my eyes I'm headed for that callin'

And I've fallen from grace
Tell them I've tried to wait
But they're too late
I can see when this pain will fade
Oh god heaven is callin' my name
Go hard or go home
That's the motto I hit the lotto
Mister sorrow can miss tomorrow
So grip the bottle of this Moscato
My eye whites are not white
They hot fire and not nice but in my ice
I need a shot twice

(Falling, down... Gonna, drown)
Make way for the idiot
Interior is hideous
Need help like immediate
He actin' like he don't know alcohol is insidious
While I celebrate life
I'mma elevate heights
Not known to man 'cause I chose to ban
My clock on the land on a hella great night
I'm knowin' this my callin' so I gotta try to miss that call and
Alcohol and you twist that big sack and hit that
Think I better quit that stallin' and stop
Feelin' real gotti I'm mixin' my liquors
You gotta get me at the party
Naturally naughty
Please help I'm still trapped inside of this psycho's body!
Forever takes me away
And I've fallen from grace
Tell them I've tried to wait
But they're too late
I can see when this pain will fade

Don't nobody wanna deal with a nigga that got it together
For real and even think his own thoughts
Everybody wanna do what everybody else doing the copy cat is what
They been taught, Imma get in the brain of the lame
I contain pain and Imma give it to the rap game
The way you're doing it the way you're pursuing it you're
Gonna ruin it villain it's a god damn shame.
Are you ready for the real here we go now,
Most on the radio can't flow now,
Everyday I gotta cut the radio down
Sound like another Pac or an 
You can't have a contest or a show down
When two cats got the same kind of flow sound
Tecca Nina I'm coming to put the mo down
Run up in the record label with a four pound
Am I too versatile cursed to drown in the bowels
Of the earth man I'll be first to growl and burst out the vowels
Of the original murderist verse out the mouth
Big Tech N9ne's gonna be the one running the race
That's real I'm speaking to everyone in the place
I can deal with you don't like the drum
And the bass if you can deal with a mother fucking gun in your face
I can't get with it, record labels and the industry is sick with it
P.D.'s some really don't know a hit for shit
Kick the bitch if you diss my hit, you might get pistol whipped
Catch'em in the hall, hitt'em in the jaw
Give it to the fans they can get it all
Cause the industry is punks, Tech I'm ready to get krunk
I'm comin' to straight dump with a pump

's and 
's and 
's can they conceive?
Don't they know a few gloc's 380's and master keys will make'em bleed
How you gonna say black people won't listen to this or don't listen to that
Like saying a fool can slang cane a fool can gang bang but never will get hit with a gat
You better get your story straight 'cause I ain't no devil for real
I'm a rebel for real that Tech N9ne is on some other level for real
You're a pebble to real niggas songs like Psycho Bitch and Real Killer
Einstein nigga that's a mill stealer the idiots say black folk won't feel us
What you think we dumb? Do we all gotta run when the heat come?
Showing original tongue it'll be fun but the mother fuckers want the bums
And the weak ones Suge Knight punked
The industry quick that's because most the industry's bitch nigga
I'm a man I don't be running from nobody we deal with niggas who trippin' and giving us shit
Radio won't play the unkfay thought they wanted rap
To advance but they ontday when I die imma aunthay
Every industry faggot who giving money to an unkpay
Tech and Tekneko get people involved from KC to Mexico
Strapped with that fat desert eagle run up on the industry
And let the heat go
(Repeat 4x)
You can look into my E.Y.E.'s and you can see why these
Motherfuckers don't wanna see my steeze
Cause Imma killa when lyricals come undone I do miracles
And I come from the kingdom of rumble drums
And hums become bumbles, I'm the one that begun the gun tongue get sprung
Got everyone comin' in bundles
Act like a bitch treated like a bitch, act like a chump
Treated like a chump when the funk jumps what you gonna want?
Ain't gon want nothin' industry punks you can run but ya can't hide from the ride
You can say that it's dope but I won't buy it, you can think Tech N9ne
Really won't fly but I got a killer ear and a killer eye
Def Jam take chances in my opinion, they give advances to the niggas
That's really on universal loud laface, that's some of my favorites
But the ones who call the shots most of 'em on some hater shit.
That other shit, for ya mother sis or your brother bitch
Not no lover lick, packing blackened fat and blubber shit
Yeah, the radio dead cause the industry is punks put the
Double barrel to its foe head

In movie terms, directors use this phrase to describe the last shot of the day while on set.
The stories you are about to hear are true.
The names have been kept the same to reflect the Strange.
This is the Martini...
This is Sam.
He was so in love with her, but she was young,
So that put her off in a jam,
Though, she was sweet as a yam,
She wanted to explore other options with her man,
Straight sending Sam into a rampage,
And no matter what his fam says,
He's lost without this woman,
And don't wanna live any damn ways,
Now he's thinkin', that he ain't gon' live,
She ain't gon' live,
And the other man's mercy, he ain't gon' give,
This what love do, it cops a .38 snub to,
Knock on ya door, and take somebody that used to love you,
Rub you the wrong way, then it's blood true,
Love through, she's slug one and he's slug two,
Then on a rainy evening, with a panicked feelin',
Went to her home and looked through the window and Sammy sees them,
The door's between her and the Necromancer,
And what you think is gon' happen if she answers?

Yo, This is Isaiah,
I guess he was aight, say a,
Lady's man, all the women used to call him the KCI Playa,
Flying multiple chicks in, give the stick then dismiss them,
But somethin's gonna happen that'll twist him,
He fell in love with a beautiful black woman,
But he ended up having a couple problems with that woman,
Talkin' to other men, did it behind his back on 'em,
Facebook, Computer love, crept on the Mac on 'em,
Now he's salty, 'cause he found the woman he loves is faulty,
He told her at the very beginning 'Don't You Ever Cross Me.'
Now that she did it, he plans to do something unlawfully,
Get a gun off the street, because he was treated so awfully,
One bullet for her, one bullet for him,
Crimes of passion, ain't no more pullin' for them,
And the worst way, we broke apart, it really hurts lady,
I've gotta go, but yo, you gotta go first baby.

He loved Kim a lot, above them was not,
But a jealous ex-husband would love them to rot,
I guess he loved kim still,
His only thoughts him, them, kill,
'Cause he a coward motha fucka,
On Christmas Eve he broke in and waited in they house for hours,
Crazy mother fucker!
Brian pulled up with Kim and little Alissa in the car,
Saw a shadow in the house from afar and said 'Wait!""
Got out the car, opened the gate, walked in the house,
And her fucking ex sealed my nigga's fate.
That was my best friend, Bitch Ass Nigga!
Walked out the house and shot Kim right in front of Alissa,
Then he saved the last shot for him, blast!
Now you better hope I don't go to hell, because I'ma be on your ass!
(Chorus - Krizz Kaliko)
Take a drink,
It's more than what you think,
I gotta let you know,
Don't plan on letting you go,
But if you have to leave,
That's where we'll end the scene,
This is the Martini.
Last shot's for you or me..."
354,The Melancholy Maze & My World Intro,2006,Everready (The Religion) (2006),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"What up sit up get up wit us killas
Enough niggas to crush ya luck and bust ya guts and liver
Hit with the rigor now ya livin' off in the river
Watchin this arsinist while I spark a bit of my heart
And embark imma start the shit
Welcome to the bottomless pit
Animalistic I know its hella dark in there
My world is not like a regular life
We tote big guns instead of a knife
Hella grim night the devil is in flight
He said a buretta would get whatever's in sight
You got a job, I ain't got one
You got a wad, I gotta shotgun
You got a guard, I got squad
You here to work I'm here to rob!"
355,The Need,2006,Everready (The Religion) (2006),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Tell me you love me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you need me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you want me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you need me
My son wuz born on six, six, O six
Maybe a sign to get my mind back on the crucifix
Or get back in the church but it hurts in the mean time
So I'm drinking daily for skirts make a b-line
You'll find yourself searchin for ""me time""
An extra-sexual home alone and she's right next you
When you in trouble it's a double edged sword
That'll get ya split ya
Crack open the bottle and let it hit ya
Tell me you love me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you need me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you want me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you need me
Now I'm only lonely as I wanna be
A million miles on the road a million women in front of me
(And you can have us all)
Wifeys at home what she don't know want hurt her
(Wrong)
It'll kill her and I'll be the infedility dealer
You'll find that earth girls are easy
And eager to please easy to ease on her knees to freak me
And damn I messed up 'cause now she's in her 3rd trimester
And I gotta fess up
Tell me you love me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you need me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you want me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you need me
For the root of I'm tryna shoot up to the top and its true love that I got for the loot up
If this music pop I'm tryna give my son the best of it all yes I'm blest with a check yet no extra to ball
You find that ur ends don't meet if you don't move ur feet and get back in the street life
Money is the way to survive the way to feed the need for greed in this life
Tell me you love me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you need me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.
Tell me you want me
Yes, I do. yes I do. yes I do.

356,The Needle,2016,The Storm (2016),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"I once said in a cypher of famous friends back in 2011
""Who do I catch?""
Outside of technicians' tunneled Tech vision
At a point in time when dope is the new whack
So it's safe to say we're in Bonnie says Cheadle
On the outskirts of our army, we scare people
But it's not for evil, up with hawks and eagles
But I'm lost and feeble wondering if this restarts the needle
Look around, do you spot Tech
In front of seventy thousand at RockFest
By the way he won the crowd does he got next
To infect the mainstream or sell a lot less
God bless my core fans still around
We're here 'cause you held us down
Love the way that you love my sounds
But I'm still try'na break new ground
Feels like I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing a new song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move
Yes doing this for, yes doing this for, yes doing this for profit
And my pocket's one dimension
I wanna reach so many hearts and souls is my intention
Since 2001 is when I started my ascension
But in 2015 I went up just to get honorable mention
Makes me wanna end it, I get so offended
When they speak of genre breaking but no N9ne is ended
Or friended I'm winded, my music's intrinsic
But it's kinda looking like the needle ain't moving even when I did a killer with Kendrick
Jimmy Kimmel was splendid, formally an attendant
But when we were done it's like not one of them were mended
Maybe it's my image and large amount of grimness
My pen spits on them scripts
Thinking I'm on a sin trip and then skit
Rock on the range we had 'em flocking for Strange
But it was a shocker when no rockers remained
When it came to the game where they claimed
Fame could get you big as the Beatles
Yeah we got it this far but I really wanna push that needle
I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing a new song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move
Pardon me Lucas
I was blessed to do a song with Marshall Mathers
I was thinking when the emcees hear this they hearts'll shatter
'Cause the art's so radder than babblers with partial chatter
But the garble swagger actors win it all, but this?
Not a chart no latter, dark so daggered
Why do nigga artists do this with me?
Man it make me feel so good when they all really do skip the fee
Slipknot, System Of A Down, Deftones, Doors got a few hits with T
But the one thing that makes me wanna say screw this and flee
Man I did it all this when music is free
I could blow out a fire with one breath
Look at the sky in the sun set
Sing a new song to change the mood
And move mountains with my hands
But just don't understand
Why this needle just won't move
Now they gonna say ""poor N9ne, please you're fine
'Cause you made it to the Forbes List 'bout at least four times""
But since I wrote my first rhyme it's been war time
To get the masses to see this talent deserves more shine
So this year I sat at my very first Grammys
Me and my partner Travis watching my peers go hammy
I thought about all the awards these folks should hand me
Man I swear I'd disappear if it wasn't for fans and family"
357,The Noose,2011,Welcome to Strangeland (2011),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"I've tried writing this letter now
Several times before
When the party's over and the liquor is no more
I tell you now that living has become somewhat a chore
And following their rules is such a God forsaken bore
Now I say god because I'm program but I believe in none
I see no interventions and I see no holy sons
And if I'm wrong then strike me down and break these breathing lungs
Just take the words reverse them back upon my evil tongue
I've seen children harm each other like it's second nature
Some just want to watch the world burn
Bang upon the drums
And that is why the music and the rhythm will live on
'Cause chaos has a melody and death is like a song
I sing, sing out to the rafters I sing
Close this little chapter and I think
This life is a disaster and it stings
I'm trying to find a way to just sing
Sing out to the rafters I sing
Close this little chapter and I think
This life is a disaster and it stings
You seem him trying to find a way out
What a world x2
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
What a world x2
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
I went to visit wounded soldiers out on Camp Pendelton
And the cause of the missing limbs it meaned that it's no love like Wimbledon
When they sat before me young as hell
Look at me accolades like gentlemen
I'm thinking that the enemy took away their ability
To walk and to touch
No way of rekindlin'
What is now gone
Unless they got money like Forest and Lieutenant Dan
The war
If you in a dam
They have no remorse and that any minute bam
That's fucked off
While we chillin' on tour on the bus getting sucked off
Know a families greaving
Because war is receding
Their peeps and they crying their butts off
That's why I get so much
When I flow bust
While we got it so good
'Cause it's so rough
But the young soldiers who do exactly what they are told to do
Damn
Do exactly what they told to do
Defend their country and uphold the crew
But give my one and only soul for you
That's a hell of a job description
I don't know if my gods with this one
But I guess it's the laws of sickman
Sending out youngins and they fall the victims
Of an evil klans plan
That's why I be saying ""Dwam""
'Cause on 9/11 I realized our fate is in another man's hands
What a world x2
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
What a world x2
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
When I see how my love ones had left
I wonder how long I would fight
I wonder if I would give in
And let the reaper lead me into night
See I got to much pride left
Like my grandma that died to early
Reaching for moments
More but instead the cancer in her lungs took her from me
We drift
Naturally like two ships in the roughest of seas
That's why this moments precious yet I'm to distant to feel it complete
See these days I feel so disconnected
It gets harder to drop to my knees
I guess that's a side effect of living in generation x-y-z
Obsessed with pain and greave
Man I wished we were both kids again
Things were simpler than 90's incident got me losing friends to the hands
Of violent men
Fast
Faster then speeding bullets
Whizzing down alley ways
So bubbly I'm waking up from this haze
But only to realize the world hasn't changed
Suddenly I'm not even fazed
Y'all think it's the way we been raised
Fuck it
I'm sick and right back in this haze
Cause this can turn out to be my last of days
With a hope and a prayer
Put a rope in the air
But I'm just too scared
Choking from the pressure
While I rock this chair
Swing back and forth and tempt death with a blank stare
What a world x2
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
What a world x2
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end"

If I ever go... if I ever go... if I ever go...
If I ever go away...
I want everybody that loves me to be...
Ridin' Paseo, not in the day though,
Cherish the day, but then roll out when the day go,
Ridin' away yo pain and sorrow,
Live for today cause you might not see tomorrow
Ridin' Paseo, not in the day though,
Cherish the day, but then roll out when the day go,
Ridin' away yo pain and sorrow,
Live for today cause you might not see tomorrow
Roses are red and violets are blue,
And we all get purple rain when you put together the 2
True, lets talk about this street I know
Meta meta yo is needed when its time for me to go
I spent my whole life on this KC street
The PASEO where the real stay and the fake sees heat
Gangstas lay low, get the queso and everyday breathe deep
But when the day goes all the broads out cause the baby's sleep
On Paseo I reminisce if they love me then give 'em this
Never know when to go cause this life is so hit and miss
Cry for me? never just have a ball wit each other
Cause that's what I had thanks goes out to my father and mother
And I love you so mama
If I ever happen to go mama
I think there's something you should know mama
I stayed away 'cause I was tryin' to become somethin'
Give a house to that one woman
The reason everyone's bumpin...
Lets take a journey startin at 85th, wrote some of my latest hits
Off 85th came back from Cali then I stayed with Chris
Off 76th my first baby was conceived
Off 75th was with slow mo in conditions you wouldn't believe
74th and Paseo on the corner
Slept with the AK for my homie Scoob
Any body came through that door was a gonner
64th I ate balogna and kicked it with mac and sonya
In French Village I sold dope for my folks in a place with a crack aroma
63rd street is the land (and in Bishop Hogan)?
Demandin y'all just keep rollin'
(Expandin on bishop strollin)?
Mastered music on 61st
If I didn't use it I would spit the verse
This is how how you find me if demons happen to hit me first
Right on 58th I lived from 12 to 17 with basima kechramin, marty, hassan and hakim
57th and 56th I had a ball I learned some tricks I learned some schemes
From my homeboys y'all know who I mean
RDVs 55th paul's liquor try and talk slick if you crazy
Results in getting stomped by doc and stu-baby
Keep ridin' paseo for me
If you ridin' solo tonight
Just keep on thinkin' marco polo for life when you're...
What's the paseo hah
49th street
On 47th is gates and sons where Tech N9ne eats
39th at the bootleg I used to find peace
But at the scottish right on lynnwood masons at times meet
I used to kick it on 27th and 28th (true's lake)
Careful... you might find yourself off in that piece if you hate
19th was my family's church they tried to save me too late
Cause doin' shows on 18th and vine that was my true fate
Mary Lou Williams was my aunt
9th where I was raised
Way minor way back in the day they used to fight no one was framed
But now on independence ave I hear my son donnie
Sayin' that he hear gunshots every night on 5th and it scares his momma ronnie
End of the road 29 north to the bridge
If I go I'm leavin' everything to my wife and my kids
Travis if I go whatever my half is you give her
And no funeral just throw my ashes in the Missouri River... Love."

A stallion

Chest like... (ooh areola!)

Always on the road, Doing hella shows
Day to day high and lows, but that's just how it goes
When you grinding, homie ain't no rewinding
Time but the family behind in this business that I'm in
I don't feel anything and it's hard remembering
Places and faces they think I'm what December brings
The day is just like moments turned to hours,
All the graphs, sound check, radio spots and quick showers
Hit the stage and get so much love from the fans,
Keep it rough with the fellas, but I make the ladies want to dance
And still I don't think you understand what's real,
While I'm with you with my wife another chance is killed,
And my kids all three of 'em suffer in the worst ways,
Cause last year I missed all three of they birthdays,
So when you see me with me eyes full of pain,
Give me love cause these are three of the reason why I call the road 'the rain'

I heard you won't be home for Halloween, is this true?
(Right after Halloween baby)
Yeah I'm used to it,
Why don't you teach me and Reign how to produce music,
So we can travel everywhere that you're traveling,
And be in the family, me and sissy fighting and tattling
I know you miss that, I know you dig that
Do your fans every wonder about where your kids at?
Is Donny really coming to move with us in L.A.?
Will mommy still love you and be with you everyday?
I gotta go now, I love you daddy but slow down

When it shakes then they chose it, fakes who hate lose it
They love my pain because it makes for great music
But in the interim this family matter is a tend to one of mine
Leave in January and come back when the winter come like:
Calling my wife when I'm in the rain and then end up getting into a dumb fight
'Cause she lonely, you try to console her but you ain't come right
So it's about what and what?
You give them everything they need,
But what they need is your presence indeed,
Life yes has been a strainer
It's like if been a stranger
To my kids and wife
That's the life of an entertainer
More money to gain,
More people to change
Swords deep in the game,
The world's peeping my pain
Out on the road cussing for sure, reaching for fame

Believe me I'd die!
Believe me I'd die!
Hey!
I'm the real thing they can check my stats
All over USA, Overseas, and back
I didn't get out of this shit through crack
Education and motivation and just do rap
Built all my fans, one by one
They lovin' the bullets coming from my gun
They do cry for me, digging the alpha me
I'm giving the spirited heart from my tongue
How can you say my life is make believe?
When everybody call me for rent, I paid the G's
I create the ""C"" notes, we dope
So why the hate, 'cause he broke, we growth
When I look around I see jokes
With a whole lot of boss and boast
A marti taught me to not be flossy
Cause these copies will doubt me, close

Just give it up cause our cut is due
Tech lit up and it's better than you
Never in blue, better than runes
Made my money off of summerin fools

Put on my mask, spittins fast, get the cash quick
How does it feel to be real?

366,The Waitress,2008,Killer (2008),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(Hi, may I take your order?)
Dwamn!
Hey, that's all I'ma say right now
I'm at a loss for words, girl, you, girl, gon' take that bow
You lookin'... boy, my lady would hate this
If she knew that I was out with her but I'm trippin' off the waitress
Woo shit! Who's this? Baby, why you do this?
I'm sittin' here with another female and it's 'posed to be exclusive
Beauty, fully loaded booty hips and thighs
I want a raspberry lemonade, baby, and whatever yo name is on the side
You speak unique, beautiful teeth I just peeped
It's makin' me weak to the point I can't even eat
Cause you give me butterflies, them butter thighs need to be publicized
A wonderful face and waist that's great and there's no mistake that I love the eyes
Never like them other guys, 'cause when I want it I'm on it
The way I'm watchin you feel uncomfortable, don't it?
But I'm thinkin' you should be in movies and this you need to quit
Then suddenly under my table I got a kick
(Hoook)
I'm with my girlie but I'm lookin' at the waitress
I'm at a business meeting trippin' off the waitress
Can't think of eatin, man, my girl will really hate this
I'm sittin' here with her but starin' at the waitress
And I like the way the waitress (work that, work that)
Come get your money, girl, and (work that, work that)
I really like the way you (work that, work that)
Can I get you on the floor? (Work that, work that)
The waitress got it goin' on
Take my order anytime, I come here many times
A week so she can give me mine, baby girl is plenty fine
Business meeting, capital grin, was sippin when she caught my eye
When she came over to us I said, ""Can I get yo number on the fly?""
Smell like no other, look like she strip undercover
Wish I could follow her home and just say thank you to her mother
Another interested brother who'd love to become your lover
Burn rubber to the spot to tell my dogs how much I dug ya
Outta here but I'm not gonna leave this place without gettin' in yo face
I'm not a disgrace so I gotta see how you taste
And I move at a puma's pace
So baby please if you find the time to get up out the weeds
I wanna make you my squeeze cause these other chicks you supercede
I call her waitress and homie, I call him server
The waiter's a bloody murder, I never wanna hear no murmur no further
'Cause she's bliss, I'm tryin' to get in yo knicks
I want you so my order you can 86
(Hoook)
And don't be tippin her below 20 percent
She need plenty for rent, leave her with pennies, then see her vent
To get money's her purpose, you don't tip, go get burgers
Believe her's is for TIPS meaning Tuition Ensuring Prompt Service
I'm nervous 'cause I'm gawkin mom's curvage
I'm beyond flirtish, us hookin up we both concert it
Where you get that smell from? She would never tell one
But she told me this, she say me she liked me 'cause I'm well done
Now your girl lookin' real, real stanky, ain't she?
'Cause she know you lookin' at the waitress thinkin' hanky-panky
Her attitude is wonderful, even got the strength to thank me
Even though she a single parent breakin her back but ain't so cranky
I had to make her my girl, now she gon' eat with me
Southern booty, mane, I truly never need to flee
I'm stayin focused, the waitress got me posted
But dwamn, look at that booty on the hostess...

367,The Warning (Skit),2009,K.O.D. (2009),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"The warning of the one who's coming
Sending divine authority
The prophecy says
That people will flock to him
He will give them false hope
And when he's in power
He will destroy everything
He will change everything with one voice
If that one voice can change one person
It can change many
Many can change a city
A city can change a state
A state can change the nation
The nation can change the world
What if he is the King Of Darkness?"
368,The Worst,2000,The Worst (2000),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(1st verse)
As I blaze the PM
I inhale with the scent of a million men
I exhale wit dumpin 17 up in the what the fuck I am?
In the midst of a crisis God knows all the sacrifces I made
Might have to hiest to get paid
In spite
But can't jiest the price
Instead a nigga played bitch made
Niggas think they know me
The don't know me
They, phoney funny
But they don't know
That I'm that ill type niggas that'll open that gut
Not much luck
I'm feelin' skunk wit a capitol S
Hit the cess
Killed the stress
Rottin away in the Midwest
I guess
They was right
When they said that was such a psycho sight
Sick inside a slight
Deliver that makes me want to go Master P at night right
No more pain I complain and pray to God, AND STUFFS
It was unbearable until I tried COCOA PUFFS
That chocolate tie got me willin' to fly up in the sky
But when I lose altitude that high
Just makes me wanna come down and die
Whos responcible for this madness, me?
Whos responcible for this sudden strike of sadness, me?
I can see
I can look into your eyes
Smile and then to your surprise
I'll be yellin' ""Die, nigga die""
When all the bullets fly
Don't know how much longer I'll be on this Earth
'Cause I'm the worst type of, nigga on this here turf
So disperse
The worst, the worst yeah
They keep tryin' to pull me under
But I been to long tryin' to make it over
The worst, the worst yeah
After all that I been through
I just don't know what the hell to do
(2nd verse)
What it is
What it was
And what it shall be
You tell me
Cause this nigga ain't livin' healthy
Bitches think I got money from here to Shri Lanka
So I'm thinkin' of killin' you when I'm makin' love to you bianca
Can't you see I ain't you seein what I mean
I got plenty and mean streets my team tweaks
So my future seems BLEAK
Take a peak at me I ain't happy she got me
Under child social serviceses and shit for bein a slacky pappy
My khakis are low saggin from illio type little bags
Pushin ten of them on top of the world like James Cagney
Feel that agony
People naggin me
My ragedy life ain't worth livin' sick of my aunt and uncle draggin me
See me drink my life away
Smokin' tokin my life away
Tryin' to put this trife away
In the deepest darkest hide away
If I could fly today to the Golden Gates
I could get away from this place of hell and fakes
But it might be too late
What it gonna be
D-E-A-D
Another S-T-A-T-I-S-T-I-C that's me
Puffin that stronger W double E-D that hunger
Don't know how much longer I'll be on this Earth
'Cause I'm the worst type of nigga on this here turf
So disperse
(3rd verse)
That's why I say
F-A-H-Q
If you ain't crew
Some busters on my hit list betta hope it ain't you
My pockets thin
About to sin
I got to spend
About like 10
To get that Henn
To make that blend
To make that fool come up out his ins
Devilish thoughts
Hell is feelin' kinda of crellish
God tell us what we got to do to make the muthafuckin rellish
Spell it, out to me cause broke is imbarrasin
I'm psycho like Woody Harrleson
I can make a comparrison
Like Aaron Yates
Norman Bates
Perfect mates
Dippin up in Wally Gates
Bitches yellin' head is swellin
Thinkin' of goin' in hell and bakin with the beans
Got me fiend
Murder for my green
Seems, I'm cursed not first
The last verse
I burst, into a blood thirst
But what is it worth
No hearst
Nobodies turf
Fuck planet Earth
Disperse
Because you're dealin' wit the worst (the worst)
The worst
I know that it can't get no worst
The worst, the worst yeah
After all that I been through
I just don't know what the hell to do"

What is havin' roaches in trouble finding more dividends
Dying a poor citizen
What is pausing the door to seal us in war kill us men trying for your kid again

What is weight in your safe
So we can stay in your race
Lay 'em on tape invading your state with this pain in your face
When it aims the door slams to aim with the program the bitters give a damn you go ham you giving them more stamina What is having a manager to book so many shows to go jam
What is at the bottom
That I really gotta
What is in a column without another who stopped him, dropped him, popped on top of him
What is summer, spring and autumn
What is to the top and shot him with his poverty
What is acknowledging the prodigy

Never been a harder rhymer in my region or globally that's holdin' me I'm totaly hard and bossed up
Why you think the majority of the rap musical authority sword me, I balled and crossed 'em
'Cause they don't wanna let the crazy kid in then
Spit his hiems speakin' a grim religion
Of rhyme, forbiddin my hisems are hidden
My mind, to written then spittin' the kid in
The N9ne, is playin' you, slayin' you, sprayin' you, permanently delayin' you, swayin' through
It's the gay in you that's hatin' who somethin' that hella beyond that does

That I won't be lettin' ya

Why they spittin' and dissin' me

Preppy like Hilfiger
Pretty vill nigga
But wanted to make my dollar bill bigger
Turned into a field nigga
Not pickin' cotton
But pickin' up mics and rockin'
Recoppin' so I can feel richer
So I started drinkin' real liquor
Send me a groupie
And I will stick her real quick
The dilsnick it will hit her ex pills
I can feel nigga best deals
You can get the steal
If you ill I'm concealed with a
Technina millameter by my side
God used to guide me Lucifer beside me
Evil was lively trippin' with wifey
Never was treatin' her nicely
What this music got me into
This is the message Imma send to

Lettin' me really know what sin do
Listen 'cause the hurt cut me deep like a ginsu

Full of money bitches weed and riches
Kansas City niggas grind it
Cook it up in the kitchen
Pay attention to the corner nigga

Laugh at the storm
And mastered the pawn
Bringin' war at the crack of the dawn
Tottin' the bomb

Like a malachi blowin' smoke in the sky
See the world through the eyes of a real nigga
Look into my eyes
You can tell I'm a rider
More shows more clothes
More hoes more dough
And no foes yo

Some times I wonder
How did I survive
With all this drama in front of me
Poppa went out like a bitch
For runnin' from me
Though momma never lied
She cried
Seen me sittin' in prison
Servin' a sentence
With bad intentions
Still no repentance
I'm heart broken while chokin'
On a joint dipped in water
And high hopin' the future's wide open
For my daughter my eyes are open
To all animosity constantly
Falling quickly the devil calls it
A blessing to cross Nitty
Lessons are taught quickly
Hell my pride will die with me
Then to repeat back
To the penitentiary visit me
Hell bound coffin dwellin'
Before a life in the cell yelllin'
Now free me
I'm in desperate need immediately
Truthfully speakin'
My life from night to day
24 hours I fight
Despite this hell to pay
Can't wait to see the day
When my adventures begin
With this here life of sin
I'm all in

Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever
Burn in the flame
This life
I live in the rain
I'm an angel but the devil's
Possessing my brain

Is it heaven or hell
I really can't tell
It half cupid half relic
My life is anghellic
So I dance with the devils
And I fly with the angel
And I stand on a level
Where mind is so tangled

I know and you know
That hell will be
Hot for a nigga's infidelity
But until then
God forgive me
For any promises that I broke

Can I be
Forgiven
For all the liquor and weed
That I smoke
When I succeed will I cope
Will I still breathe
Without both

I don't know
But when I go
I'm leaving out dope

Brings demeaning demons
In G-strings

Make 'em fiend semen

This ring got me a top notch straight hot fox
We sought rocks and the Ewok Slot was caught got
Dropped two playing hopscotch on the block
Ought not twat plot yo for hops knot I brought dots
This ring help me remain sane, no dame games
Came from bane to a changed man
No cane thang refrain from gang bang
Slang a praying brain reigns family fame, then came pain
Say hello to Tech N9ne
Everybody wanna be down with a nigga women get a whiff of the money
Thinking of taking it from me they get up in the club
Giving the love throwing the pussy full of liquor and bud
Booty hopping around up in the MO
Get to looking around
Every ho wanna lick a nigga low
Infatuated with niggas with dough
Get 'em in the sack and try to make 'em let it go, Tech N9NE
Be autographing bitches, in front of rapping niggas
Who think of having figures, they get to grabbing triggas
They can't imagine villains
When they come back and get us
We get to whacking niggas
I ain't never wanted no parts of this
I don't never want to break another heart for this
Why the devil gotta make it
Why the Lord wanna make something that'll kill something so marvelous
This ring
Brings demeaning demons

This ring
Was supposed to protect a nigga
Best for niggas
Who couldn't stop having sex
With bitches
Bless the Mrs.
Who stressed the kisses
Even though we spend our
Checks with strippers
Obsessed with clitorises
This ring
Made a nigga feel macho
Cry for
Lie for
Die for
My ho
Nigga I go face Diablo
With a hostile gospel
If I can't have tres or cuatro
Little vatos
Imma let a lot flow
What they sell
Up in Osco
Up a nostril
That sound like
Tech N9NE
Nigga where the weed
Where the mutha fuckin'
Blow
And the hoes
Next to me
Is ecstacy
Asking me if I wanna roll
Bitches never gave a fuck
About a fling
Makes it exciting
When a married nigga
Wanna fuck around
And bitch know he's down
For the fling
I've been tested
And a lot of times
Been invested
Didn't know this Tech shit
Would constantly get a nigga
Molested
Been approached
By some of the best tricks
In the game
And they came strong
But I hanged on
To this ring
And I hope my son
Don't sing the same song
This ring
Brings demeaning demons
In G-strings
Songs we sing

Quincy J. told me
Superstars are good providers
But
Two times out of ten
When we're on tour
Family's not beside us
What
Can a nigga do
When he makes ends
Add more to the time they spend
While he make ends
Everything else breaking
And the bond at the house
May end
And your wifey steady yelling
'Bout quality time
And you think
With all the fame and fortune
Shit ought to be fine
But what happens
When the divorce papers
Just gotta be signed
And you lose half
And your children
Cause you gotta be N9NE
I wanna relax with them
And spend time
To the maximum
But if silence is golden
Then me making noise
Is Platinum
I gotta be Tech
And Daddy
And Hubby
But music
Women mixed with family's ugly
I know and you know
That hell will be
Hot for a nigga's infidelity

Like I'm there boyfriend for the night so I treat them a little meana
It's been too many years and surely been way too many girls

(In backwards:)
Some might call me uh paranoid
But I think I would just say that I was very aware of my surroundings!""
Retrogression
Lets go back to an earlier state
Back when a bunch of cats was jumping to this world via hate
Gangbang shit, yeah I'm guilty of it
When I'm looking at the TV, man seem like everybody really love it
Wave they flags high, for the world to see
Even though we know we don't want our son and little girls to be
Nothing like we were, some of these youngsters got no thumpers
Bet they want no funk, but they could get shook up like a seizure
If bangin' retrogresses, now the color's no longer measures
Stresses of rival sets get wet, go get the Tec, and press it
To make sure they get the message, alot of these motherfuckers
Reppin sets know they faking just like they know the phrase don't f with Texas
But still oblivious and fans see free
But real life is mo' serious than a damn TV
Like '85 they might be gunnin'
Why you living like a drummin'
When you sippin' wit' your woman
I can feel the trippin' comin'
When they all talking loud
Feelin' proud cause no one is gunnin'
Ey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
When I'm down for the town
In the club beefing with the woman
Ey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
They was family, used to love you
Swear to God that they would never put nothing above you
It's just to, see your successes, then 'bout plug you
Put slugs to, 'cause they ain't with you so now it's fuck you
I get so much love, I get to searching
For the evil 'cause is coming, I can see right through the curtain
But the haters fill with anger, I can feel it's about to worsen
The bigger that I get, I can feel these tricks is sick for certain
When I'm partying without my bodyguardians, I'm hardly and chill mode
'Cause I'm feelin' they wanna scar me and fill those
Clips with lead and headed to kill foes
They real hoes plus they fake fuckers like dildos
Envy can equal murder, show love but they preferred ta
Hurt her servers, picks alert us, quick with the squirter
Like '85 they might be gunnin'
Why you living like a drummin'
So you sippin' with your woman
I can feel the trippin' comin'
When they all talking loud
Feelin' proud cause no one is gunnin'
Ey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
When I'm down for the town
At the club beefing with the woman
Ey, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yeah, I can feel the trippin' comin'
Yo, I can feel it comin'
Why do I see mayhem?
'Cause when I watch the news I say damn
Everybody living in they last days
Are in hate and waste and
Innocent children, evil it feels the nation
Facin, life sentences are the case man
It's just too good to be true
Or maybe not huh?
Buried in the hood could be you
'Cause you got some
Extra, but next bra, ain't lookin' for no kinda lecture
When you sittin' on something better, gotta be alert
Or you off in a stretcha
When I'm 'sposed to be here in fun
I'm standing near a gun
'Cause I ain't gotta have no demons
Scheming on me, tryin' to tear a lung
I'm just a real one
I keep my eyes open for the bullshit
Never am I clueless
I'm looking every direction
Everywhere it comes
From

No matter how big I get, or how much money I make
The seepage will always find a way
When they all talking loud
Feelin' proud cause no one is gunnin'

Picture me in a syringe
Inserted
In an over exerted
Felon
Antidote having 'em running
Eternally
Across the helland
Dwamn
Losing my sanity
Living up in
Les miserables
Fuck bitter broads
This shit is gonna have us stacking
If there is a God
Imma take the
X away from generation
Place it at
The end of S.E.
For the duration
Upon the level
Tell the devil to what
Skip a human
Imma tell him
Behold pale horses
Like us
Shame on a nigga
When he's feeling
Hella down
For a ninety-nine killing
Ain't giving a
Fuck I'm putting Nair
In your leave in hair conditioner
Now you Hari Khrishna
To my listeners
In this ryhme
You will find
Psychotic scriptures
Saying it's something
Disrupting my mind
Tech n9ne
Your mind is fine
There's just not anyone
Like you
The whole wide world
Don't matter
No
They can't flow
Like you
Understand
My thoughts are twisted
So mixed up
My thoughts are twisted
So mixed up
My thoughts are twisted
So mixed up
My thoughts are twisted
So mixed up
(2nd Verse)
I'm lifted
B
I'm twisted
C
I'm sick and sadistic
A, B and C
Something's I do
I just can't stand
Up in my bathroom
I sex
Six women
Mentally
Just me and me
Me and my faithful
Right hand man
Tie up a Muslim
And shoot him with liquid pork
On Ramadan
With force
I'll make a Christian
Read their kids
The necronomicon
On Christmas
Don't trip on this lyrical syphilis
I flip this
So the yonks will catch the vapors
Like menthalyptus
I'll feed a dominatrix patient
Pain pills
Give Wu haters permanent
Fang grills
Trick the artist formerly known
And give him
The same slave deal
I'll lift a couple of
Dr. Dre's reels
Sell 'em to Snoop
And No Limit Soliders
Just so I can see
How paid feels
Hazy shade
Of decade
Hookers with grave shields
Where AIDS fills
The carcass
Bet a milli on it
Techa N9na be the darkest
Heartless
I spark from the gut
So what the fuck
I'm trying to contain
The insane
But what
But I get mixed up
So mixed up
My thoughts are twisted
So mixed up
My thoughts are twisted
So mixed up
I try to maintain
But I get mixed up
So mixed up
(3rd Verse)
Welcome to my
Asylum
It's hectic
They call me dyslexic
Rogue infested
More vicious than Cujo
Fraudulent tested
The punks arrested
Got the neck slit
Exit
I'm twisted
I know Hollywood backwards
Says doowylloh
Force feed me a
Sumo
For about nine weeks
Playing Club
Nuevo
Till he's blue
Though
Then stuff him in the front seat of a
Yugo
Body filled with beef and toaster
Strudel
Let up the break
And watch him race
To the intersection
Now he's through
Though
Yastuvo
I slide with a gang
Of twisted individuals
Somebody better be
Looking for the criminal tendencies
Never will they get us
In the penitentiaries
Killa
Millimeter N9ne rips vinyl
I know
Mix flow like Korean albino
Wino
Once breeded an elephant
With a rhino
Called it the hell if I know
Throw Chucky Mason
Off in a pit
Of militant Jews
Banging hella opera
The real meaning
Of helter skelter
Is when they skin that
Forehead swastika
Am I twisted
Am I twisted
I'm twisted
Better keep your distance
Mama gotta call the psychiatrics
For mental assistance
Tech n9ne
Your mind is fine
There's just not anyone
Like you
The whole wide world
Don't matter
No
They can't flow
Like you
I must make you

Before you get bust the fuck up!
And you wonder why we all deny ya
'Cause you're a motherfuckin' liar!
(You suffer from)
I don't give a damn about what come out your mouth, fuck no
You ain't comin' real with us, don't chill with us, just go
The biggest I've ever seen, I mean everything I say
But you got U-R-A-L-Y-A!

Kill the shit, faking like you got a feel for this
You're not built for this
You're coming really foul and it smell like dead gefilte fish
Liar liar, you created
Why ya why ya get true negated
Just mutilated, through the latest
Silly sucka what you fuck up because you the sadist
Don't do ya job like ya oughtta
I'm gonna beat ya like a pinata
Better yet I'm givin' the devil a stigmata
Hit you with the hell of an Afrika Bambaataa (BOOM!)
Lay 'em on the ground
That's what you get for playin' on a clown
Sayin' that my sound, they don't wanna hear it, missed em
But I gave you money, to get the shit done!
I don't wanna hear it from ya, spirit's under
Attack the jack, you're the nearest one
To get fed up from raps racks and steal his numbers
'Cause they DJ's that truly hit
But they already gave in to a newbee bitch
And that's booey ish, booey ish!
8-1 say, ""That's booty ish!"" (Yeah)

You just told me that the DJs didn't feel us
Instead of telling me that I should have paid more skrilla
For the amount that we gave in to the loss, I should have killed ya
But I was busy rocking 20,000 in Roskilde (Roskilde)
Aw shit, off of me you made profit
Brand new Benz, you done copped it, bought your bitch a new locket
Came in talking that boss shit, now my bizz, you done lost it
But look how much it all costed, the music industry's a hog bitch
Man, I really wanna kill them and in this business it's hard to get you though
When you kill a motherfucker the consequences they are predictable
Would you starve and quit to flow? And it be hard to get the dough
But you're barking chicks to blow, off the ship you go, far more shit to show!
I don't give a damn about what come out your mouth, fuck no
You ain't comin' real with us, don't chill with us, just go

I am this way 'cause I got up
And got it when I was the oddest
To demolish the hottest scholars
With all of these goddish products
Call it way polished
I jot it, dot it
Then they got it
Stay modest
But brought it
Psychotic thought is raw and sick
But everybody didn't want to give a nigga time of the day
Or will I ever reach another when I'm in the grave
I got to be different to keep up with the pay
Say, say, say
What you wonder about Nina?
The one who is wishing me
Coming up missing
That one is a dreamer
Calling me ugly I laugh
Because I'm rough as rugby and fast
Industry's chubby and flab
You look sick, pudgy and crap
Now your chick want to hug me and smash
I look lovely with cash instead of muggy and clash
You act like we were buddies in class
Got my painted face
Ain't it great?
Really illuminated
But then it tainted space
Better to bring it straight then gain it late and aim it fake
Famous for my brain its fate
That I strained in fate
Then I became the great...
Yates

No love or nothing
Just blood and suffering
For the ugly duckling

Trust me
Trust me
Nothing
Trust me
Trust me

(Repeat all 1x)
(Verse 2: Acie)
Ever since I came out the womb
And I was birthed to the planet
It's like the Earth couldn't stand it
I was just worthless abandoned
So I write verses and curses
To try and cope with the damage
Citizens gave me you cholos are going to feel my curses in Spanish
I've been in verses then vanished
I'm not the first to be banished
But ostracized because I prophesied the churches are scandalous
See my words are just managed
Perfectly perched on the canvas
Painting a picture with scriptures
With my fellow dirty from Kansas
So I'm going to spit on the wax
Drip on the tracks
And spill out my pain
Rather than give me a gat
Empty the mac
Shatter then spill out my brain
People are strange
Verses be spinning
A dime on the top
Trying to get all the change
I have to devise me a plot
Then gamble the lot
So I'm stocked to get me some change
See all the hate that they gave me
Fueled my passionate speech
Made me react on the track and start
Whooping ass on the beat
So since I'm rude
I fire noses up like a flu off the grease
Head in the sky hella flying high
Like I'm blew off the sweet
(Verse 3: Priceless)
It's my goddamn time
Go ahead shine a light over here on the darkness
What's you thought?
What, we gon' play dead
Roll over and add up losses?
Damn fools
Cause no pro band cool
Politicking with the rules
Eat fools for the carcass
Because we back
Well seems like we leave
And another leave
A vegan
No sausage
But don't ride dick now
And act like you like bums lit now
Keep signing to killers and fat drug dealers
Is you really the big shit now?
I gotta spit
These niggas be weak runnin' 'round like their nuts cut loose
Can't even shake a nigga hand, gotta dap a nigga up
Fuck around and touch butt-fuck juice
Mayday to the payday, they say we stay
Don't cut the noose
Yes, off with the heads
Niggas off to the bed, getting head like Duck, Duck, Goose (Oh)
Technicians form a petition to never ever let it up
On a rapper that sucks, and these industry fucks
With the bucks that will make you turn small from a duck
Crystal Meth, Cocaine, E-Pills with a little weed fill and a lot of free will
And a couple refills to whenever we steal
Won't see thrills like these steals on a steap hill
That's some hot shit
That's our shit
One more time, don't ride dick
Shit, I got us creeping on your level
Aqualeo, now that's speaking of the devil"

I'm on a pilgrimage to the rhyme mecca
Because I am Tecca
And this mind left ya
Down at the bottom because n9ne's betta
And if swines ever find the quest to try and test the cleverness
They in a mess- bind and yes I sever decay 'em and define pressure
I'mma spit it for
Big wars and not a critic whore
Hit ignore
I got acidic core
In this war, you're not a winner- PAUSE
Wanna pla-ay every da-ay
Sta-ay for the way that I spra-ay sa-ay
You gotta pa-ay that's ya-ay and ay-ay

Don't be smelling like it if your under me rumors
Will begin about you from hungry pumas
Hoping wishing prayin' when your gonna be sooner
When I'm dead 'em I get up in the head of the nigga that said it
I'm pickin' the lead up then I wet 'em look like a predator, I'mma get 'em 'n' let 'em pass
Skip the peace it ain't no humble we luna
Moon stricken
Rednecks sayin' who them coones rippin
BOOM
Pick 'em up
Take 'em off to my land in my van a lotta room
Get in and in
When I catch my flow tryin' ta wake up your style
But you fucked up like, uh oh
I'mma make up for it now
It's unfair to be
Such a mother fuckin' rarity
Beware that we tear many squares
If he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bear that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nair any spared caring is barely there
It's unfair
(Verse 2 - Krizz Kaliko)
Who are these dudes we never let any of these fools cheat on the rules
Kristopher egotistical narcistic whicha
If they say no then we tellem to get up 'n' move we makin' some rules
I heard of these guys, murderous when it comes to scripture
Ubiquitous, and Godemis, they Gods to us
We Gods to them, so we meet right in the middle
Too fat to fry it up-belittle
When its unfair, we got their hands in the air
And you can't even get a show
No one cares that your freestyle so rare
But no body could anybody know
It's easy for them physical favors
Why y'all just spend all your paper
Breezes bend over the table
Tattoos embezzle my label
Drivin' 'n' traffic 'n' rhymes them choppers Africanized
We work
What's happenen to your wives
While your at 9 to 5's
Might as well stop rappin'
It's gonna happen if I stop laughin'
'Cause it's too hard too much press- just play and disregard
The four horsemen of course with force to the coarsewin
You talkin' tall when y'all gettin' the short end
It's unfair to be
Such a mother fuckin' rarity
Beware that we tear many squares
If he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bear that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nair any spared caring is barely there
It's unfair
(Verse 3 - Godemis (Ces Cru))
It's unfair to me
Nothing is what it appears to be
Killin' off anything and everything
Comin' to threaten somethin' that dear to me
If you feelin' the fear then flee
FI-FO-FEE-FO what the fuck up
I'm retarded with a clover
I guess you can call it dumb luck
When I'm rappin'
Out of habit I'm adamant gettin' Adam
But I would rather
Hit a madam with a Magnum and split her atoms
Tryna fathom the famine that will diminish the anger
Got a place it at the table, we eatin spinnach with strangers
Sippin Carabou lou
Spillin the sickest shit ever
Tell 'em 'bout who the Lou
I'm one of two in the crew, with knife in my pocket an' one in my shoe
Surrounded by haters so what am I do
Thinkin' I gotta devise a gameplan
Get a ticket to kickit with krizz 'n' nina
So I guess I'm headed to STRANGELAND!
And my main man, woulda told me to merkem
Doin' the sin indeed
I'mma catch a couple more, then I'm formin a human centipede
Pause ""Pause""
I'm aware to vacate it, look it they god at this
Who the fuck is fuckin' with
Tech, Kali, Ubi and Godemis
It's unfair to be
Such a mother fuckin' rarity
Beware that we tear many squares
If he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bear that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nair any spared caring is barely there
It's unfair
(Verse 4 - Ubiquitous (Ces Cru))
It's unfair to be, doin' mother fuckin' charity
You can pay a fuckin' fair for me
You really there? Ain't nothin' there for me
Move carefully
I swear to be, High as a cherokee
Light as a parakeet
In my rhyme I spoke like jeremy
Feel my fire, my smoke, my kerosene
We we don't want no drama
We we don't want no trouble
We we can keep it peaceful
If y'all y'all can keep it humble
I, I really don't know what he come fo
But his name is the same as a gun yo
Strangeland is a place that I seen in a dream
Since I was runnin' around in my undbro
And you heard it direct from my mouth piece
Techs got it me out, an found me
Turn out we the perfect strangers
Larry Appleton and Balky
I was out east
When texts came in, when tech sayin' what is about to be
Before you fuck me, on the go know that everyone around lookin' out fo me
Now that we got that in the air
I can feel the change in the atmosphere
A crew been livin' in limbo
Apprently all this rappin' has trapped us here
And after years they hearin we lost inside the dream
Not necessarily
I won't let this rap thing bury me
I'mma let these bat wings carry me"

It's all delicious, like this
Till you walk these shoes
You couldn't understand my views
While you on your Caribbean cruise
I'm payin' my dues
On the corner tryin' to hit licks for slips
Trouble making them flips
So I'm bout to smoke a dipped
Now I'm ripped
How could you make a hypothesis on me and my partnas
With you college degree trying to psycho-analyze me
You can't see what I see
You can't be what I be
When I'm deep in this pit of violence
Without parental guidance, nigga
Spot, translation cops watching me every day when I'm
Just holding down my block
Fuck a ?addha?
My brother, My fathers' in jail
Momma fell
So I'm bout to make a sell
What the hell
Gotta get that rel
Then I bail
I smell like sherman
You can tell
The chemically it got me wanted to use my genitaly
Up on this bitch, that bitch
The kind that don't want to bust a gang
Ain't got no love, so I'ma Just hit it and hope she
Don't give me what his name
Packs
Need one in case of emergencies
Urgencies
Bills I'm trying to hug
Still you trying to judge
Yelling out the federal prison
Boozy nigga you can cruise
Till you walk these shoes, I'm Living
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take the neiro
(Tech N9ne)
Your on the outside looking in my friend
I mean my foe
Come close and I'll be forced to let you know (what)
I'm living the life of a hustla
'Cause the schools done cut my visits down to zero just
For beating down a busta (it's a musta)
Keep lookin' at me like I'ma steal you wit an hour
And all you think I do is eat shit and shower
I'm a survivor
Present day McGyver
Two sider
You depriver
When you look at me you think I'm a conniver
Whasappening
Breakin you and your boy in a game of tennis
I'm a menace
You one of them people step into our sneakers a
Minute (nigga)
You hopped out the boots
Yelling when you see its hard finding work
Being a class A felon
Drug selling
Scrapping niggas from every side
Fighting family drunk and high
Ain't no punk in I
Domistic so I'm off to the penal again
So momma tell me how am I to reconcile again
Tell you walk these
Catch me in the smokers LeSabre
Running spock off on the block
Can't understand my behavior
I'm coocoo for cocoa
Selling but driven
So muther fucker you can cruise
Till you walk these shoes, I'm living
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take the neiro
Till you walk these
Only speak about what you know
Till you walk these
Our record use these views to the floor
Till you walk these
Pick a punk to verbally abuse
If you walk these
You couldn't walk a block in my shoes
Till you walk these
Don't preach to every nigga you choose
Till you walk these shoes
You couldn't understand my views
Wouldn't kiss me on your shoes if they were given
Motherfucker
You can cruise till you walk these shoes, I'm living
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take the neiro"

Introduce 1st my hav-a-hoe game, I have a hoe in different area codes
Few in the East, couple down south, but mostly lay west of the coast
I wouldn't hav-a-hoe wit flaws in her mix, gotta be down right down
Pretty, blade in tha bra with her tits, and if me wit a bitch meant
The kid didn't git no doe, well then I wouldn't have-a-hoe, (that's it)
2nd and foremost, I walk wit a limp, Bishop Don Magic Juan, Pimpin' Ken,
(Yeah) I talked wit a Pimp, Good Game, White Folks, metallic kanes and
Thangs, U-M-E, Miami, Flo., they chopped game wit strange
Beware cause the Industry go get messy, and I walk wit a limp cause
My dicks, well know, I got a fetish for suaving these Dolly Pardon's
These women, vibe off a nigga, that's real, ask Mr. Marcus
I'm here to put the cuffs on tha game, (And palm yo faces)
Whip ya ass till you holla my name, (like domin-atrix)
Ain't nobody gonna take this crown, (why) 'Cause we stay on point
Like Stacey Adams
Bitches on my Bows
Everywhere I go
Pimpin' holla church
Remy extra po'
Get a lot of love haters
Hit the doe. Get up
Out the whip, Gators
Hit the flo. And we
Bubblin, money be dubblin,
Niggazs ain't struggling.
Hat cocked to the side
And we walk wit up limp
Cause my dick heavy... Hey!
I'm a barbarian, not a Good Samaritan; I ain't a hoes keeper by far
Leave it to married men, I gotta (stick and move, pick and choose, chick-n-crews
Who like to suck dicks 4 loot
Snatch'em then a hoe gits offered, snake and the bat tatts, (strange)
Flashing threw the sky like gotham, Nick-name sta-flo, 'cause I'm known
To put a crease, in ya lame day-old, newly grown dubious thesis
A-atrocious behavior, ferocious demeanor, karoded ya name up, you owe
It to Jesus,..to wait in line now, and yearn for the buck flow,...
It don't matter if ya win or lose, learn for the Gusto...
Trust no (B-I-T-C-H), especially when you live in the, (f-I-f-t-y)

Plummet we don't want it son it's the dumbest
We done and wanna get from it
Havin' visions of eden, while this evil is breathin' inside a demon
Deceivin' with light I'm even this season
Companies kill my culture, sucka said on the sofa
See the soul of a soldier, I'mma go to Zack De la Rocha
And awaken rebel sound that'll break that fake label down
Gotta vacate this able now, everyday fate from a halo crown
If they oppose it, give 'em hell is the key
Well is the free, we ain't practicin' celibacy
A relic you think we anghellic, tell it to me
We'll mail and sell it to fellowships and telekinesis
When occur the people movin' develop diseases
Sick on your symphony some get hella facetious
When searin' your shows I'm somberin' the shell it decreases
Light for the lord of love a lot leveled is leaf lit

Cowardly critters not with the strong better run along
We are free, we are
We are free, we are
We are, we are free
We are, we are free
No time for killin' time, because it's killin' time
I'm an American hustler sedated in my prime
Pray for the 99, ride with the 88
Spinal 1 percent it's just a numbers game
Fame for us psychos, Jackson's to Michael
Missiles for silos, no stones for the high road
Army of 5-Os, for half foes I hydro
Drones over my home, no phone tap to spy on
And though they say there's nothin' to fear but fear itself
I keep a bottle of spirits near my bookshelf
Because a runaway slave will never sleep well
I self medicate the frame in my brain cell
Married to the matrix, that bitch got two faces
She gave me all I got and took away all my acquaintance
Travellin' the planet walkin' on so many stages
Made me realize dimensions gettin' jumped through one a daily
He's an alien, Eddie Arkadian
In love with money and fame there ain't no savin' him
But I'm the fuckin' last dragon spittin' radiance
Walkin' a planet I created in my cranium
We are free, we are
We are free, we are
We are, we are free
We are, we are free
I rewrote this verse mad times
One for every single instance somebody denied me my damn shine
One for the brick layers, one for the winning team with injured players
One for the ""He's gon' be the shit"" sayers, keep me on my toes
My fanbase rattlin', the speakers on my bows and my sneakers on the stones
You give me props and I'mma keep 'em in my soul
'Cause I'm MVP'n on these cretins down below
All this world's gone catnip, rattlesnake bat shit
Critics eat a fat dick, vinegar and cracked lips
Citizens get it in, gimme ten seconds in Atlas
And I'mma show you even on this bitch front to backwards
Breakin' down codes, bro True Detective
Ridin' to some Wrek shit, could change up your perspective
Don't just take my word for it, check up on the guest list
Jesus and the Devil rollin' dice up in the flesh pit
Free speech, free souls, free press
So we preach to seek goals and leave stress
Beneath streets, we reach hold and breach depths
To the mothafuckers we bringin' ruckus with each breath
As if the sales stop, been stay
See Ten K was just the entry, my pen slays
My next album's gonna be bent shades of dense graves
Death to the shackles around my ankles, I been free
We are free, we are
We are free, we are
We are, we are free

401,What If It Was Me,2016,The Storm (2016),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Free your mind, and remember
Winners are not people who never fail
But people who never quit
All I ever wanted was to sell
Records to the people make a lot of mil', yessir
Rap to me, it was the holy grail
I'm gonna go and do it, I'm never gonna fail
Yeah, but first I gotta make it out of Hell
Wake up and I see crime
All of us we on it's eat time
My homies love me yelling ""Peace N9ne""
At the same time, throwing B signs
Throwing 'em back and repping the street, I'm
Doing music and I'm writing beast rhymes
But my V-Slimes, had no weak minds
Got with the music, started a group and we shine
Music gave us hella hope
Made it up out of the bangin' and sellin' dope
We were stronger than a bottle of Yoke
Till one of our members found a kid to grope
Then your honor gave the peddy the rope
Losing a man, the band began to slope
Never did think a plan was damned to croak
So doing it solo-dolo stands the G.O.A.T
Started making hella LP's
2000, all the way to five, felt free
Because of the hand the label dealt me
But in '06 Fontana helped us melt cheese
Number one independent gonna be spending a ton of funds, in a minute
That's when the government want the sums, then I send it
In a couple of months I'm done and replenished
Everywhere I go, I'm selling out the show
Around the world I kill 'em and everybody know
Whenever we hit the studio and Tecca Nina drop, hot
Even though I will go toe to toe if somebody bang on me
But I'm rolling in the dough and I'm really respected and protected
Chances of me getting shot, not
Everyone loving the Tech
Publishin', I get a check
Loving the cities that with me, the people that call me the best
I don't have any regret, but it's a bit of neglect
Missing my babies I love 'em and none of 'em leaving me yet
Feeling good like a villain should
In a mansion, but I'm still in hoods
Not like Trayvon, J's on
Khaki shorts with a red tee like I will and could
I can conceal it my permits say
If evil happens to swerve this way
Hope nobody deserves quick spray
I feel an angelic surge this day
They feeling my songs
Been doing it long
They want me to sell 'em my CD right outta my home
'Cause I'm in the zone
I'm putting 'em on in front of the store when a couple of police won't leave me alone
Why they tripping?
I fit the description
It's two of them rushing me I'm on a solo mission
To get people to listen, but they pushing and kicking me
I'm on the ground when they telling me, ""Cause of a gun suspicion""
It was in my pocket, ain't trying pop it
When they scared of a brother with a gun no one can stop it
Then one of 'em lost it, and then I was shot quick
Officers took me to heaven, I'm dead and with multiple rockets
Didn't matter I was good and living inside a mansion next to ball players
'Cause of the move he made was drastic now I lay in a casket carried by my pallbearers
Fears what I see, making 'em kill a G
Rotten apple in the batch; don't tell the rest to flee
This happened in Baton, R-O-U-G-E, even I fit the description
What if it was me?
What if it was me
What if I never got the one chance to be
Everything and everywhere I go, I wouldn't see
If by your hand you took that from me
But what if it were me?
Laying right there
I'll never get up again, it's so unfair
My babies cry out
You never cared
Things that we do make each other so scared
So what if it was you there?
(Should I just) Take your life
(Should I bust) Make your wife widowed, withered, hugging the pillow
The scent of you still on her
Spirit she feels on her
The whole world weeps
Blood we all spill on her
And I know, it's ill will; the pill's hard to swallow
How should I feel when I'm being followed (followed)
By the words that you say to me? (Crazy)
And you saved my life, take my life
I gotta fight, all of the night with cops, crips, bloods with sore fists
I gotta fight, all of the night with cops, crips, bloods with sore fists
I gotta fight, all of the night with cops, crips, bloods with sore fists

(Tech N9ne)
My energy's pumping, it's finna be something to see
'Cause when I be drunk then it's sin to be humping with me
If women be crunk and authentic, we jump in the B
In a minute, we bump into the finish, T punching the V
Like a prize fighter, eyes light up
When I glide by the thighs
Try the size, why the cries?
'Cause I be the pied piper
Wide or tighter
I'm like a pie-diver, prize swiper
Rider all night to the hide hiker
I been away for a long while
Sick of just being your phone-pal
You might be needing your long towels
When I get to you, it's on now, wow!
Better gas up when you with the king kong, gal
Get it, pivot, women digg it, lick it, then I hit it
Girl, that's my grown style
I'm really gonna be living in what you're giving
I'ma lower you like I'm Peppy Le Peau
Give me the goodies, I wanna know if you wanna get on top of me
No, I gotta be when I'm stepping to you
Give it away to Nina, repeat it, I feel it up when I beat it
You never want me to leave, but you gotta please me thorough
If you wanna piece of a gorilla, you want it with Tecca Nina
Better eat your Wheaties, girl!
(Krizz Kaliko)
Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me
It won't be easy, yeah
Hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me
Better eat your wheaties, girl
(Shawnna)
I know you want me baby
Do I make you horny baby?
I can tell by your eyes, you want me to ride you like a horsey, baby
Better back up off me, baby
Oh, you're not the type to be scurred
If you feel this, we can do it real big
Maybe you can meet me in the back of the G4
We can do it in the 'Lac on the D-low
We can do it on the track for the people
Seen you looking at the ass, we do it for the cash
I throw it like craps at (??)
Never had one like me, shorty
When I'm done when the wife is shouting
Maybe thinking that she's like me
But you see, it's just unlikely, shorty
When I get him, I'ma get in the rhythmn
And have him feeling like he never ever felt before
Get up in him and I fill him with venom
And have him chillin' and drilling me from the night to the morn'
Baby, you gotta be taking over me, part of me, pardon me
After he got me in the zone
Love it when he call me on the phone
He never been in love so much, but see the body in a thong
He like to put the nookie in his face
And every time I get out of line, he like to put me in my place
He put me in the A, or should I say the 745
Gotta .45 chillin' in the safe
So whatcha wanna say? your boy wanna see me
Trying to meet me 'cause I'm on TV
Better believe I want you, and I finna come through 'cause I ate my Wheaties
(Krizz Kaliko)
Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me
It won't be easy, yeah
Hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me
Better eat your wheaties, girl
(Tech N9ne)
Since I gotta super label, and
I got a big amount to pay the hand
So can a nigga get a table dance?
You looking hotter than Zatarains and I'm thinking of getting laid again
I don't give a damn about who that belong to
Don't keep the Nina waiting any longer
Want to be the lucky one to get up on you
C'mon, shake your booty, baby, do that conga!
You don't wanna miss it, 'cause I'ma hit it, terriffic and I be so
Rugged, ya love it I'm, cock diesel,
Me so, horny but don't be thinking I'm evil
Please your body, cause baby it's squisito
Don't get it twisted when you get with a nice cat
Give me what you want, 'cause they know when you like that
But get up in the sack, you won't be able to fight that
Brace on your neck and in your panties, an ice pack
Eat them Wheaties and really you can get power
Come in and get at you every motherfucking hour
Give you alot of it then we get up in the shower
Then hit Roscoe's on Sunset and (Gower)?
Imma leave for a minute but imma be back
You can videotape it, can't nobody see that
Eat your Wheaties, cause everyday ya need that
So if'n you looking to see me, you better eat that
(Krizz Kaliko)
(??) Did it, just so you know
Ain't no prison in the system that can hold a bro, no
And I'm gon' hit, like I told you so
Don't be actin' like you forgot it, you're sposed to know, yo
Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me
It won't be easy, yeah
Hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me
Better eat your wheaties, girl"
405,Which One,2014,Strangeulation (2014),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Yeah, which one of ya idiots claims that ya know me
Ya don't have a clue so back up lil homie
My headpiece is heated I hang with heretics
We load up and lock and aim where the red is
And bang where your head is, I bet y'all will beat it
Oh Dean, that's my dog, them words y'all will eat 'em
My power circlin' small, I think outta the box
And try different angles to wreck tables or not
My shot's wet as a whistle, I'm on fire fam
Y'all don't even know that's my column in y'all's diagram
Who they want, Godi or Donnie, ya better choose wisely
Greet 'em with ketamine and then that Adderall IV, try me
Checkin' to see if the guy's fearin' ya
They wishin' I would go stick my dick in the criteria
It's all good, doin' the type of shit y'all wish y'all could
Dippin' out with skaters through fuckin' acres in y'all hood

Which (One)
You fuckin' with pick (one)
You label this fic (tion)
You lookin' there is (none) is (none)
The story of my twin and I, Pisces not a Gemini
One of us is underwater, other floatin' in the sky
Highs and the lows of me, violence in the poetry
My evil twin we goin' in, I told him to let go of me (Nigga let go!)
Don't let nobody close to me, drunk when I'm not s'posed to be
I take a sip, start to trip and won't nobody know it's me
One bottle Jameson, take it to the face and then
Now I'm talkin' 'bout the bodies buried in my basement
Spirits talkin' to me, I can hear 'em, I can see 'em too
Lookin' in the mirror and I tell 'em it's just me and you
One of us is goin' out, the one that's always showin' out
I put my fist right through the glass and told that bitch to close his mouth
Hand bleedin' needin' medical attention
I'm feelin' no pain, I'm in a whole 'nother dimension
Next mornin' wake up, don't remember shit
Bandage on my hand and dirty condom on my dick (Ugh)

You label this fic (tion)
You lookin' there is (none) is (none)
Which (One)
You fuckin' with pick (one)
You label this fic (tion)
You lookin' there is (none) is (none)
Pick three and guess what you get, me
I'm messed up and sickly
The head is a mystery, quickly twist T
With a idiotic mix-ly, hit exotic chicks gee
Killin' got it history
I've become a scumbag fuckbuddy needed to wipe after
She got me and my lady's cum rag, that's just one of the things I done bad
Like when I put Dulcolax liquid mixed it within my brother's rum flask
I can make a love potion, give you the ocean
Then you wake up in a pit gettin' instructions on how to rub ya lotion
You think I'm jokin' while listenin' to Drake's ""The Motion""
I put syphilis dick down her throat and that's without her havin' a notion
I'm playin' I don't dare summon them other suckers
That tell me to do bad, there done and them under covers
She think the demon's unfair, Hung wants to love her lover
After this verse she's not pickin' nare, one of them motherfuckers
Which (One)
You fuckin' with pick (one)

You lookin' there is (none) is (none)

408,Who Do I Catch,2011,Welcome to Strangeland (2011),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"Now I'm known by the masses
'Cause I've grown to make them smashes
On this journey, did many back flips
To get your attention, now that I caught it
Who do I catch bitch?
Real rock, rap and not a Xerox, weird not?
Enough to make ya fear a lot, from here watch
I ran scrimmage, and I fought to the damn finish
And I popped eyes open without eating me canned spinach
My fans in it, constantly tellin' me I can win it
If I stand grimace damaging man every damn minute
I've landed then, expands quick, it slams wicked rhymes
Grand spittage, H.A.M. with it, fam dig it's, N9ne
Chea! Hard to see me like the background
Your rap styles coming softer than a cats meow
Red laces, but booted like I'm Iraq bound
That frown will get you ate by my cannibal from Sac Town
So relax pal, pack thou gat down back I'll black out!
With a fat smile, I might react foul, so don't make this cat growl
I caught everybody when I spazzed wow, who do I catch now?
Who do I catch now?
Maybe those who can't get with the rap sound
I caught the industry, who do I catch now
Who do I catch now?
Maybe those who don't rip with the rap down
I caught the whole world, who do I catch now
I caught wrecks, AND THEN
I caught checks, AND THEN
I caught press, AND THEN
I caught sex, YES
And no permanent diseases were caught when I caught that
Now the games been offset, 'cause I'm strange in a lost mess
I caught a lot of shit by being different, they tried to hinder Tech
By calling him devil worshipper, surfaced up on the internet
My temper gets grimmer just as winter sets I'mma venter, yes
And I can't forget when the finger pressed triggers, I can't remember that
I caught stars attention, Nina had a large ascension
So high the lord is squintin', (NO), I mean y'all are squintin', (OKAY)
'Cause I'm tall as Pippen, (NO), Got a flawless vision, (OKAY)
On a lawless mission, (NO), 'Cause I'm ballish pimpin', (Yeah!)
Best believe I caught fades, never homie soft made
I'm active, no off days and I got boss paid with music, I caught babes
And I even caught gays before they all caught AIDS
Who do I catch now?
Maybe those who can't get with the rap sound
I caught the industry, who do I catch now
Who do I catch now?
Maybe those who don't rip with the rap down
I caught the whole world, who do I catch now
I hit a pot of gold, with the harder flow
You hataz oughta know, that we are the MO
This is my land, you in my hand and you'sa particle
And I see you marvel with the fact I caught the carter 4
So that means I caught Martians already
And you talk shit about that, because often y'all petty
And because you jelly sicklin' its costing y'all bettys
To get tossed in our headache 'cause we lost in tall fetty
Ay, you catch the vapours 'cause Nina, he catch hoes
And you non believers are funny people, like Seth Rogen
Better pay attention 'cause if ya simpin' ya get froze
And I'mma leave you with a wet nose, when I'm rippin they catch colds
Hm, when I'm rippin they catch colds?
Hey that makes sense, don't it Ben?
Lyrically I'm cold blooded!
They be like: Ah-Ah-CHOO!
Who do I catch now?
Maybe those who can't get with the rap sound
I caught the industry, who do I catch now
Who do I catch now?
Maybe those who don't rip with the rap down
I caught the whole world, who do I catch now"

411,Why You Ain't Call Me,2008,Killer (2008),Hip Hop|Underground Hip Hop,Tech N9ne,"(Tech N9ne)
To whom it may concern...
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
I'm not broken-hearted, but I couldv'e been old when I started
Why you ain't call me?
You know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded
Why you ain't call me?
You sleep on my music and that's a damn shame 'cause I slam my bang
I've been inside every hip-hop circle you could imagine
Gangster or Pop, even backpackers know that I'm real good at rappin'
I was strugglin' back in the day when my hood was lackin'
Yo so I'm 'bout to talk about what shoulda, woulda and coulda happened
If music was about inovatin' and penetratin' generations by generatin' musical integration
It wouldn't be about limitation and demonstration
Imitation within a blatant looks just disentigratin'
It ain't about the music, it's just about the fame
If you ain't popular homie, then you just out the game
If video and radio don't frequently announce your name
They don't know your music even though you blow most out the frame
But a closed mouth don't get fed when it stays shut
Lay cuts with Tecca Nina 'cause he can straight bust
Say what? You ain't heard of me gettin' paid bucks?
Torrent y'all see me rippin' the stage up
I've been on tour with Hov, 'bout 27 shows
Why he ain't have me on a record only heaven knows
Maybe he missed us, missin' the big picture
That this is a fixture, aw yeah, he got Twista!
Well Twista's my homie and we both from the Midwest
And I guess Hov ain't lookin' for another speedy rapper kid yet
Me collaboratin' with them was all in me dreams
Matter fact the only one of 'em called me was Beens
He told me he played you The Industry Is Punks
And you loved it so you know Tech is what the industry would want
I started down at the bottom, got with TOG and then it paid
But I wouldv'e loved to been on the third verse of Renegade
They must think I'm a stick of dynamite with no stem
That's probably why I got D12 but no Em!
But I burst flame and I bet that y'all know my first name
'Cause I'm the hardest this side of Earth mane
This ain't no hate-mail, this a love letter
I love you niggas' music and I hope is does better
I just wish you woulda hit a brother that love cheddar
But I'm ballin' now and I'm better than I was EVER
Space age flows like Jesse and Primrose
Tin-fold, I used to open-up, now I end shows
Grim road, when you one of the best with slim dough
And you ain't got Dre, Storch, Pharrell and no Timbo
I've met almost half of the DTP
But the couple times I spoke to Luda, don't think he see me
Had never met I-20 but he spoke at BET
Shawnna love me, Field Mob and Chingy decently speak me
So I'ma re-inaurate the game, it's all fame
And you don't get no play if you an emcee with a small name
If I wanna get on TV I guess I gotta call Pain
And Nelly, my great-grandmother's name is Maud Haynes
Maybe I'm trippin', full of delusion
Maybe it come from all the drugs I was usin'
Maybe I am the best thing that you ever saw
Maybe I'm wrong and you don't know me at all
I guess I'm blinded, I got reminded
That none of you just will ever know who the N9ne is
And you never heard of the homie from the Show-me
PUNK THAT! I know you niggas know me"

Go right up
Connect, ain't nobody but Tech
I been dope since I put raps on BASF cassette
Since then my pen been at war like Montagues and Capulets
A menacing strap you get, been winning in rap who's next
To get permanent power polluted, paper protruded
Punani praise on its pubics and they're prepared to pursue it
Get us then we drills em
Having plenty thrills um wellington New Zealand banging her with a chest like Wendy Williams
Everybody know with the kinda money I bring to the table I can put 'em off
Take 'em all around the world, get the dough and get the girl touching other people and I brought the hood along
Teams where I wings (?) people I never seen cry
If you wanna see the mean side just go stream what I seen on steam, put your hand in my (bean pie)
Salam (?)
I'm something fierce, I bring player haters to tears with my schemes
Come reach me, I got the species locked and no one can beat me
The feces, what I released on this beat he's gonna wanna seek me because I'm the WeeFee
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
I can put you on
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
With my push alone
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
Now you said in stone, I'm the
WeeFee
People need me, I'm the WeeFee
I get them on movies and TV
Connecting Scooby and Stevie
Straight from Missouri to Fiji
Trying to intrigue me ain't easy
Unless you bringing them bad beasies in three-bies
We be having them louder than one (?)
Organ, grinding, so they pour us in their mouth, and they're loving it like Thorazine
When they freaking out I'm Jim Morrison
But I go without hair Billy Corgan
Releasing a lot more of them endorphins
WeeFee wins the war again the gores been like a horror film
'Cause we kill, everything so be still
When we move in, not a cheap thrill
When the beat feels like E pills
Steadily repping B till, my B-L-double O-D spills
Then again Tech Nina keep mills
So I know I'mma get me a refill
Tech is highly respected
Been with a few major labels and left it
I rated my records intrepid
Since they didn't rep it then F it
Now I'm elected to get the check and invest it
I'm such a vet that you can bet I can get you connected
'Cause I'm the WeeFee
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
I can put you on
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
With my push alone
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
Now you said in stone, I'm the
WeeFee
If you with me but hating me
Disconnect from me, get away from me
Get a bit of fake (?) they're big as your paper be
When they try to shake a G they normally have to take a fee that's lower than what they pay for he that works in Eminem's bakery
You doubt a N9ne, you out of sight you out of mind
Nigga shout a crime from me they sniffing them powder lines
I'm the righteous
But I'm killing 'em like I'm Cypress
Play me like I'm not the nicest
No WeeFee leave you lifeless
Taking a knife to fight with ISIS, I like it
When they spite they get vices
When they hit that pipe think they're psychic
Wanna get in my mic and try to slice it
But they do fizzle when they hear SuWu whistles
Disrespect me true this will happen and they lose signal
This was long awaited
Strange is how all the fakes were created
They think they made it, forgot about me and skated
They music, everybody played it 'cause I was right there to save it
They downgraded they hate it cause their signal is faded
'Cause I'm the WeeFee, nigga
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
I can put you on
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee

Dumped that bitch in the gutter, they can't get on my level
I ain't give a fuck about nothing with the way I'm strapped up with this metal
I was tripping in the back of a truck that I done packed with these shovels
I don't want no problems, just want you to leave me the fuck alone
Before I end up inside of a cell and have a neighborhood inside of your home
My money be funny just laughin' at niggas
And the hoes they got keep asking them niggas

Thug life, got that 2Pac up in my boombox

Scarce thoughts being bought from these wars fought
Real talk, I'm a validated warhawk
History, this ain't shit to me, let's get it, V
Click the heat, no defeat, I need victory
It's meant to be what these villain niggas bent to be
Tendecies, stick this story, fuck the enemy
Snapping and losing it fast - Ruger, extended the mag
Fuck it, they wearing no mask - jump out and dumping the brass
Crushing, concussion these fast - a movie where Scoobie get mad

They say my angel glow is subsiding
I'm sliding outside of these high beams
And I won't dare try to mend this tear
I love, I'm fading
The good once there is just dying
So I'm withering away and I'ma trigger when I spray
And I'm attacking everybody till the feeling's gone
All my life I loved with people
So passive back then
I thought I'd be above this evil
My tolerance level then was up with doves and eagles
Currently I've hit ground zero under bugs and beetles
I'm tilted
Inside my head's a lettuce but wilted
Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine
I spilt it
Could it be how many times I've been ran over and jilted
That makes me wanna totally detach from light and just kill shit?
I know when the pain is gone
It's just a matter of time before my impulses win
And I can feel the wrong
Coming up through the cracks of my heart again
I'm holding on
I'm going straight into the mouths of makers
Everything that keeps me calm was taken
I'm letting go, I'm burning through
Reserves are low
Just pushing on these old restraints
My time is up 'cause it's too late
I'm about to blow up on anyone in my way

Drooling and blood I can taste

Find another one to get bent

I gotta say, when my mother died, I really did inside
And that's the other thing that did it
Turning my crazy on a hundred babies
Gonna plummet
Maybe I should be committed
Oh, what am I supposed to do?
Do I just keep faking?
Fucking forsaking everything I am
Another pissed motherfucker with a fist and a plan
Oh, but you're making me do this
I can scream while you stand there clueless
If you're listening, I've made up my mind
Take another step and I'll snap this time
Something please save me, I'm losing myself
I don't think I wanna stop it, but the feeling inside is nauseous
I get really exhausted off it
Gotta find a way to wash it, lock it
Profit matter so I got to drop it
Ain't nobody in the cockpit
Toss this lostness, people from the office, boxes
If you cross this, boss, live cautious
Don't make me, don't make me repeat myself
For your safety, because a pilly is beneath my belt
But I don't wanna do anything bad to anybody
But I'll never be perfect

I think they deserve it

We are the arsenal
Chemically imbalanced, completely disposable
So butter my knuckles and taste it
Another sick delinquent is wasted
I don't forgive, I don't forget
I haven't got time to regret
Everybody else in the world can hate me
Nobody but me can save me
Shit, Yates hates this place
If you're close enough for me to hit the switch
You better never turn it on

Angels chose to toss woes when the night air's cold
But it got to me when she looked up and said (I'll soon be gone)
Then I was right there, froze
Cause that meant, I'd be alone
The second, that she was gone

I'ma tell y'all a lil' story man, yaknahm'sayin'?
Yo this is a song about, somebody who did me wrong dawg
I thought you was my homie man... I guess not
Fuck it...
You was supposed to be my, dawg
Homie when I first met you what was told to me was, fraud
What a shocker, and imposter, I've been crossed, I lost ya
My best friend turned out to be an enemy, that's endin me
Hidden, no sympathy, no empathy either, homie I never denied ya
Nuttin that you wanted - women? I never playa-hated
I hooked you up, booked you up from the beginning
This enemy had love for you, shared blood for ya
When ya wanted to dig I dug for ya nigga
But you a double-crosser, nasty hand-tosser
I shoulda known you was evil, when ya told me you was cool
For we could be sex fools when we under the steeple, the retrieval
I'm tryna get my life back
No more stoppin' women from puttin' a knife at ya cap
Remember when we was kickin it, bitches was givin' it everyday
We did it in everyway, but the respect went away
You got a mind of your own now
You're grown now, can I ask you a question?
Did you forget we kinfolks nigga, we the same complexion?
I'm stressin, you was always in front of me so I listened
Everyday you wanted me on a mission
I even let you have sex with my lady like a G
Infatuated with you and not me
I sucked it up, I got back wit her, you fucked it up
By lettin her know I was creepin' around, with every chick in the town,
Buster!
I shoulda known not to trust ya
Listen I'm losin my life because of you!
I lost my life because of you! I'm losin my wife because of you!
I even had sex and a baby with the crazy bitch you introduced me to!
Now I'm straight depressed, I hate your flesh
But fate was just, belate to Tech, laid to rest
Everytime you got drawers, you made my poor little life fall
Nigga ya got balls - you ain't never had a partner like me
REAL, I never ever sold ya pipe dreams
Personal yes it might seem, nigga when you was burnin
I went to get the doctor's side cleaned
Looked out for ya health, and this is the respect I get?
Hater, ya neck I'll slit, but I cain't 'cause I'm attached to ya
And I don't know why, sometimes I wish you would just die
That would eliminate all this hurt
Maybe I could get up outta all this dirt, ya caused me
So strong, nothing could stop you, not even cerebral palsey
I can't believe it; my best homie turned on me
You musta forgot we grew up together
I'm through, life is over now, there's nothin' else to do
Point the finger and blame it on you...
(Tech + (sung)
(It's all because of you, you, you)
I lost my girl, my world, is upside down because I found you wasn't shit
(It's all because of you, you, you)
Broke us in two, you untrue, don't know what to do, I'm talkin' to you (who?)
My dick...

Niggas think, because a nigga bust, I got grips and grips of pay.
The pain grows in fame and kangols with change
And strange hos who bang in range roves for thangs,
Same shows with lames the rain woes will stain insane
Foes who drain and hang bros with brains
If you caught it that means you got it, and if you brought it,
That means you should've shot it 'cause I'm about ta, drop
The real ya need a lot to kill a leader, prop the
Nina nigga or pop the milli meter

But parts gon make you heart blow, blood
And don't be wassin' me cuzzin' me buggin me bout dubs
I'll be mud till these clubs really lovin' me
It hurts my nigga to hurt my nigga but hurt
My nigga is what's inspiring these spurts my nigga
At first my nigga, used to be my homey, used to
Be my ace, yellin' you gon slap the taste out my mouth
Nigga I never scare sebwafares everywhere,
If you need me believe me its easy, to put holes in
Shakra teasy watch the wezzy he's lots of talk

The industry cost me industry brought me (pain)
The industry taught me industry caught me (strange)
And you niggas know that the industries awfully (bane)
I ain't a snake nigga all I did is make niggas
Money was sunny now it's funny you playa hate
Niggas, over some cake the fate of a show me state
Nigga in my face will be Don Juan the great 2 late nigga.
I don't speak a lot I peep a lot I creep a lot
And people who speak are usually weak and out 4
Peace and no beef a lot remember we used
2 kick it like bros now you niggas act
Like bitches and hos
Wit your licorice souls,
Tecca9 I got the wickedest flows
No kid in his mold on misery
Never will get wit this rogue, I'm pissed
At his whole little fisad of crip that is sold
Instead of a rap I should've twisted his nose
Who kept short nitty from killin' you me, who
Kept Dyamund from drillin' you me
Who kept villain niggas from vill dealin' you me,
So now you can take away me and keep on talking
Crazy and Imma let 'em know where you
Keep yo baby and where you stay D.

You can't turn enough mutha fuckers against me
You can't find a harder rapper that'll convince me
I'm wit the Canty's the Ashby's the Whitebears
LeJeunes the Harrises and the mutha fuchkin Timley's
The Theorys the Byers the canadys you know the
Familys that are known to be bad 4 humanity
Can he be bad, can he be tough can he be
Rough no cream puffs are considered to be rough enough
Nobody likes you not even yo bitches imma
Witness they sick of yo disrespectful way of speaking
Explicit always talking about how big yo dick is,
Better hope Anghellic, go multi platinum to get your riches
Blood, this is the end of men who were once friends
And then, one asshole thought he was somithin when
Punks bend over they get fucked (get fucked) hand over
Them Tech tapes or get stuck (get stuck)
You must think I'm soft 4 talkin' to Icy Roc
Bout knockin' the nina out I'm trippin' without
A doubt, Imma tell you who really is ya friends,
Vell Barkardi and maybe you and him can get
Together and tell it like it is again
It's over man, I hope you brought ya navacane
I know the pain, is slowly taking over brain.
So calm that mutha fuckin' wombat I don't
Need no Don Juan tracks to come bomb on raps.

I was blessed with the gift to disable hate
With fatal takes on the mic is makin' my halo break
And smash every lady workin' at Strange, call them my label-mates
I throw the squad up, them I'ma pour ya broad up
Genital, so plentiful, ya chemical's low but shot up
Wishin' they'd slow the god up
But I ain't trippin' when I rip I'm twitchin'
They think that I be sniffing on Snow Tha Product
Bitch I might be, this a nice key, to get ya hyphy
Dick ya wifey, this for Ike
Slice of sin or source if ya see somethin' slither slightly
Step inside the surface of Strange, sir, simply sight-see
Spit the flow, get the dough, then I hit the ho
Mister irresistible twisted is this kiss the toes
I'ma kick ya nose if one of ya pricks oppose
I'm all he hates, 'cause I became a landmark like Ollie Gates
Maudie's great, tall estate, y'all debate, nigga, call me Yates
It's no challenge, It's no challenge at all
When you up the ball against the low average
The low average, killin' 'em, toetag 'em
I'ma let you be great though, I'ma let you be great though, I'ma let you be great though,
But it ain't no stoppin' a Yates
Lately I've been like fuck rap
What? Did he say ""fuck rap""?
Oh no no, I'mma write in bold and plus caps
Fuck rap
'Cause all these tough cats really don't have no nut sack
Trust that 'nuff scratch does back much wackness
Flush that shit
Down with the gowns with the sounds for the clowns
And not in a good way
You can drown underground with the pounds
When they gust that shit
Oh so, low we stojo, hoes and dough negro we flow though
Let the soul glow, mojo, nigga
Pillowcase, over the head of the industry
Illustrate, with my mouth and murders my ministry
Seal the fate of my enemy, feel the weight of my energy
I heal the hate. Facilitate. Disc jockey's will scrilla make
Then play your records until you break radio
Ain't nothing but real estate
It's still a fake deal of mates who ain't real awake
But the mill is great, ain't no iller ape that can kill a Yates
It's no challenge, It's no challenge at all

I'ma let you be great though, I'ma let you be great though, I'ma let you be great though,
But it ain't no stoppin' a Yates
I can keep my head, while everybody losin' theirs
No Marcus, I told you, don't start this debate
I'm all arsenal friend, we the median like, you feedin' me in
Tired of bein' with the intermediate
Faded on bullshit, control the whole medium
I done ran inside my meniscus
I done out-rapped everybody Christmas
So why in the hell would I fail?
If I do, I'm just being Ezale
Front line level, untamed, unchained
After all this shit, I remain on lane, loser
And that's what yo ass get for hittin' that snoozer
My brain is worth the future, and yes, I don't get worked
So my verses hurts when they send me to kill 'em
I'm like Biblin' niggas, keepin' it blacker than Power Rangers
But why the name Zachary? No leashes, I'm free sucker

I'm thinking death and destruction, images of blood and pus, and I ain't looking for nothing but trouble
Thinking I'm murderin you when I'm just lounging

Block it out and keep it moving, I'm evil and it's pussy that I'm pursuing
Gimme the bible yes I need it 'cause tech-a-ninna's in ruin
Mentally I'm fuckin' up when really I don't know what I'm doin'
My tolerance for physical pain has gained rapidy
I'm gobbleing more thizzles then thangs but it came back at me
The holy father must have flipped and became mad at me
Because I'm pondering the wicked insane strategy
How to end it all (yeah) many men will fall (yeah)
Any sin I saw (yeah) ninna been involved (yeah)
You don't really want it with me punk you don't have the gall

Send you something so insane I'm so not for simple shit
So teeter tired of motha fucka if you want but just keep it to the left of me, crazy till the death of me

I'm havin' feelings of wanting to be the cause of you bleeding causin your family to be grieving now your soul is leaving
Entered in my mind the raw holy words and religious battles keep 'em mutilated like cannibal over serpent rattles
I'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin' from gallows as I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles
My eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums, it's time to hit the streets with guns
I'm bustin' seventy shots laughin' as the people run, I plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done
Until the pain coincides with my violence and agony, oh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me
But it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds, the hitch-cock of hip-hop and it's comin' soon.

And I was always taught by mom and them respect a woma (gyah)

First tee I go to jail then Wayne too
Notice a traumatic drop in sales when the lame dudes
Come to try the same, dude remains in the game fools
Wantin to be starts everybody ain't spangled
So how can I be confident and say these rappers ain't be prominent
Today they grabbin put a comical stain on (music, music)

With all the money lost to booty suckers (you owe a lot of people)

And if you come with that you talkin' you gon' need a dentist

Fuck a Smith and Wesson I'ma order you that chopper special
They say you shuckin and jivin from me you duckin and hidin
Let's see you duck and hide from these bullets when I fly 'em
It's been a weak nigga takin' my kindness for weakness
Till I cock back and squeeze this and I leave yo' ass bleedin
Period! Now niggaz wanna act so delirious
When I ask for my paper till I do somethin' so serious
