0,'Nuff Respect (Remix),1993,Looks Like a Job For... (1993),,Big Daddy Kane,"Enter the dragon, as I start, to braggin and taggin
And sayin' I'm baggin all rappers on the bandwagon
Feel the fury of a renegade, well men I slayed
So send the aid, 'cause I penetrate
Bein the best up, with lyrics I dress up, so don't even mess up
Or try to press up, it's better to fess up
'Cause if a rapper ever goes too far man
I start to screamin on MC's like Tarzan
So witness the glare when I appear
None'll compare, so take a seat in the rear
Child, you gotta understand, you just the man
Sittin' next to the man, sittin' next to the man, sittin' next to the man
And no one friar comes higher than the messiah
Sparkin the mic like a live wire till I retire
Whatever the comp is I burn 'em like fire
With all the blow, I hit 'em hard like... PI-YAH
So take your hand and fold cause this is total control
And no one grabs a hold, huh
You got somethin' to say, before it's told
If you speakin' on me, you better hablo espanol
'Cause I ain't tryin' to have none of the penty-ante
Mumble jumble kick yak, you better get back
Clear the way when you see me comin' through
Back up and bow, nuff respect due...
Uh, I come down and put my weight on it
Drop somethin' straight on it, and sound great on it
Parties erupt, and stages corrupt
I pour like a quart in a cup, worrrrrrrd up
I G-E-T the J-O-B done
Makin' the young boys say, ""Daddy I don't want none""
You puttin' the man to a boy, before I can even destroy
I played him like a toy -- Heavens to Merkatroid!
Check my Modus Operandi
Those who know my name know I ain't about games
I go beyond knockin' 'em out the box
You wanna be a comedian? Aight, where's Redd Foxx?
So if I want you, believe I'm gonna get you
I wouldn't give a damn if Tony Terry was witchu
So when I come in the same place as my enemy
They all start runin like their name was Sheer Energy
I won't say what you are but I'll hit you
You're found on a woman and a penis goes in you
Another clue, your first letters are P-U
Act like you know boy, nuff respect due...
UHH, put in rotation, better than creation, with acceleration
My vocabulary is very
Clever like a trick hand, sinkin 'em like quicksand
Makin' the competition feel like they need a kickstand
To support what they thought would've brought them
Some type of victory, but none of them could get with me
You better never act new
Huh, nuff respect due..."
1,2 Da Good Tymz,1998,Veteranz' Day (1998),,Big Daddy Kane,"Times was simply plain I knew they'd eventually change
Let's take a trip down memory lane
With the game talker, native new yorker
Gators on my feet, formerly british walker
Yes love, that's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Parlay with your crew at the corner store
Carrying a boom box till your arms were sore
We be wildin' on the corner free stylin'
Or politickin' 'bout doe we see piling
Or either girls we be getting with, how we be hitting it
Lying bout skins that we didn't get
Slow moving at paces through the rat races
The jordache look and fat laces
Making moves any type of way
I remember it like yesterday, hey
Here's to you
That's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Way back in the days how we used to do
Thank you for the good times y'all
DÃ©j? vu, things ain't nothing new
Shorties make me think how we used to do
When you couldn't be sleeping, if you plan on keeping
Hold of your sheepskin, heads do be peeping
Think it can't happen to you, now could it?
Came to school wearing puma's went home barefooted
And on the weekends when everybody click
To slide to the deuce to check karate flicks
Come back around the way after dark
So the crew could embark on the jam in the park
What would happen that night, was to scrap in a fight
Only way to break it up was playing rappers delight
And as I sit back watching you
Shorties out there doing what you got to do
I feel for you being sincere
'Cause where you trying to go I already been there, yeah
Ain't nothing but love I got to give
I don't playa hate 'cause we all got to live
That negative lifestyle I prohibit
Good life I got to live it, bubbly I got to sip it
Now I'll admit that I sort of be flashing
But yet and still I do it in an orderly fashion
Bring on the honeys and watch me mack these, stack cheese
Go on with your bad self, black caes
Just when the game got the stakes set high
Straight from bed stuy, the return of the jedi
With a jewel 'cause I'm tired of seeing
Charges being brought up, on brothers getting caught up
Now it's about time we connect, organize and collect
A new wold order's in effect
I send this out to the shorties in the hood
I wanna see you all live good"
2,3 Forties And A Bottle Of Moet,1994,Daddy's Home (1994),,Big Daddy Kane,"Funkdafied one time for your mind
This is how we gonna get it off baby
Now dig the flavor, oh yeah
I got the Mister Cee in the place to be
Of course, I be the Big Daddy Kane, here to entertain
I got Ax-el, ready to max well
Yessir, we gon' get busy one time for ya dig it right?
We gonna call this 3 Forties and a Bottle of Moet
Why? 'Cause I drunk 3 Forties and a Bottle of Moet
Plain and simple, but this is how it's gonna go for ya
Mister Cee, yo
It goes a-one, two, three...
Some people call me Kane some people call me Big Daddy
My momma's name is Ruth and my pops is Clay Bradley
I got a little brother, some of y'all may just know him
I would say his name, but we ain't speakin' at the moment
I walk through the streets of New York everyday
I hang with rappers like Doug E. Fresh and Cool J
I hang with Tone Loc and Don Cheadle in L.A., plus
+I Got a Man+ you know the Positive K
I get blasted with the Ol' Dirty Bastard
So peace to the RZA, the GZA
And to the rest of the Wu-Tang niggaz
My man Shyhiem with the gangsta lean, da cream
To rise to the top, and you don't stop
And Mister Cee, is in the place to be
And Mister Cee, is in the place to be
Oh Mister Cee is in the place to be
And missjones in the house most definitely
Ax-el, ready to max well
Ax-el, ready to max well
The B to the I to the like to the G
Rockin' on to the break of D
As I keep it strong I won't steer you wrong
I'm tired of this, let's go on to the next song"
3,Ain't No Half-Steppin',1988,Long Live the Kane (1988),,Big Daddy Kane,"I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics
'Cause it's ? 8
Time to set it straight, know what I'm saying
And ain't no half stepping
Word
I'm ready
Rappers stepping to me they want to get some
But I'm the kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory
They can't get with me
So pick a bc date 'cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And, stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
So what you on, hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition I just devour
Like a pitbull against a chihuahua
'Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The b-i-g d-a-double d-y k-a-n-e
Dramatic, asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
'Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by ginzu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basing
Friday the 13th, I'mma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is big daddy, yes big not little
So define it
Here's your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk
As the kane start to talk, cause...
Ain't no half-steppin? I'm the big daddy kane
My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of MCing, for those who want to be in
My field in court
Then again on second thought
To have MCs coming out sounding so similar
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it's the
Climax, and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ah shit
I stop and stand strong over MCs
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know that...
Ain't no half-steppin? I'm the big daddy kane
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be want to be competition
Trying to step to me--must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'mma get you at
You think I'm losing?
Psst, picture that...
Ain't no half-steppin?
Mister Cee, step to me...
The name is big daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make MCs evaporate
The party people say, damn... that rapper's great
The creator conductor of poetry
Etcetera, etcetera, it ain't easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like letter, man
Now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MCs, who are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'mma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slooow doown
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
Your title, namely me, 'cause I'm homicidal
That means murder, 'cause I'm about to hurt a
'Nother MC, that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him
And take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign...

5,Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now,1989,It's a Big Daddy Thing (1989),,Big Daddy Kane,"Here we go, here we go on the smooth side
Let's take a ride in stride and I'm the guide
With the source, and of course - I don't wanna be the king or boss
I just wanna get my point across
'Cause it's time to organize and open your eyes
Realize, we on the rise
To the climax, time to take charge
Whoever said we can't live large?
To seek out fortune without distortion
And stop livin' for just a small portion
There is a move to make, we gotta take a chance to break
All chains become awake
Cause this is the new way, to be proud and brave
And I ain't goin' out like a slave
In eighty-nine, I'm livin' like a champ
Step out my face, talkin' 'bout a food stamp
Child please, put it at ease
Freeze, it's time to get paid in times like these
We can't take shorts or take a loss
So take it from the kane and go for yours, because
Uh-huh
There, comes a time, where we can't be in the rear
We gotta step up front, to get our share
Make the change, 'cause we're not inferior
For example, there was a black ms. America
Let's start to do for ourself
We can't depend on no one else or the board of health
So hold your own or else you're gonna find
That if you play off of crime you go out like aunt jemimah
We gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive
To stay alive, that's the reason I've
Came to, motivate us to the length
Effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch
Takin' no mediums or small at all
We gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall
What used to be just hopes and thoughts
Are now in effect, and we can't take shorts, because
Swing on that right there, pump it up, here we go
Uh-huh, uh-huh, pump it up, here we go
One more thing
Let's unite together, we can't sever never
No matter what or what-ever
Because we need unity to find justice
Just I see equality so bust this
Take a stand and command to demand what's grand
I know we can if we just understand
The true way of livin' that was really meant for us
So one more time, kick the chorus!
Ah keep it goin' y'all
A prince paul, rulin 'em all y'all
A prince paul, schoolin 'em all y'all
And tony, tony, tony, tony
And tony tone never leavin' the girls alone
Tony tone never leavin' the girls alone
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stop..."

Daddy Kane
(Big Daddy Kane)
You know B.W. I've heard it said
That a woman is a man's greatest gift
(Barry White)
Sure you're right
(Big Daddy Kane)
And success ain't nothin' unless you have someone to share it with
(Barry White)
Mmmmm, so true, so true
I've always felt that... it's great to achieve in life
Not having someone other than yourself to share it with it is, uh...
(Big Daddy Kane)
Sho' YOU'RE right
(Barry White)
... Quite sad
(Big Daddy Kane)
In my case, I may have found someone (mmm)
I want, all, of that someone
(Barry White)
Yeah, I know what you mean
Well I'll tell you my friend
Just, communicate with her
And always say what you mean and mean what you say
Because, it's her that you want... all of me
Aoww
...
(Big Daddy Kane)
Come here baby
Come bring ALL of you to me
When I say I want all of you
I mean I want all of you from your head to your feet (mmm)
I wanna taste everything from your lipstick to your toenail polish
(Barry White)
C'mere Kane brother
(Big Daddy Kane)
I want you... I want you...
I want to hold you, I want to massage you
I want to comfort you, I want to sooth... you (mm!)
You know the way you're standin still there
I just wanna lay on the floor and make love to your shadow
(A-heh) Sounds silly don't it?
(Barry White)
Not really
(Big Daddy Kane)
But for real, let me come on over there
Run my fingers through your hair
Hold your Nair, and undo that brassiere

Violators pick up the pieces (uh)
That are left behind as you're left to find
The fury of the five fingers of death are mine,
Rippin' on the microphone, receitin' poem,
Givin' competition a Big Daddy syndrome.
Some step up, (mmm) none kept up (mmm).
They rap a brief moment and then shut up.
Lips are sealed because all of this is real.
I'm not about frontin', I tell the real deal of society (what);
So how we livin',
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving or like Robin Gibbons?
Not to offend,
I just want you to comprehend every message I send (tell 'em),

How could this lifestyle be fun to man,
To see a brother gettin' paid undercover,
Sellin' drugs to one another,
'Cause all the glamour you get is miscillaneous
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
Like um, um, let's say, un, poison,
Destruction to all your own boys and girls who like to buy and give it a try,
Admire and can't deny the high, that's why they soon die.
These are the games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay.
No sign of brotherly love,
Just scavengers in search of...
Another victory (cut and scratched)
When I'm ridin' in my Volvo, cops harass me.
They never ride past me, they hound me like Lassie,
Wantin' to give me a summons or a ticket.
Huh, I got a place for them to stick it (kick it).
They can't understand to see a black man
Drivin' a car that costs 25 grand.
The first thing they say is ""Where'd you steal her?""
And then they assume that I'm a drug dealer.
Huh, that just makes me wanna laugh,
'Cause now I'm a star and your son got my autograph,
So all the cops on the highway gettin' me,
My name ain't Kieth, so could you please stop Sweatin' me
So I can flow and go on, so on and so on
To all the jams Cee throw on.
Reachin' a summit as you learn from it,
A lesson taught from yours truly, so here cometh
The royal majesty, others have to be
Fully prepared, though they still won't last with me,
So when you hope to hang or even handle,
I'll show the meaning of power and just cancel (period).
Out of order, conquer and slaughter,
You're comin' up shorter, boy, you'll need more to
Compete 'cause the heat is deep in concrete,
Defeat, bring up the fleet, flee 'fore we meet
Or stay away, puttin' new rhymes on layaway.
Then come get this when you're ready for business
'Cause ah yeah, I'm with this (I'm ready).
Yo, Mister Cee, what is this?
MC's and enemies I freeze at 32 degrees
Because they can't drop rhymes like these.
Competition never saw none done,
So pay attention as I mention the 411.
Just the other day, I heard a brother say,
""Taxi cabs don't even come my way.
They all be afraid they won't get paid
So they zoom right past and pick up a lighter shade,
And if they stop, the first thing they want,
No more than two people and the money up-front,
Treatin' me like I'm some type of thug.
It might sound bugged but they don't wanna get mugged.""
Who's in the right or wrong? It's time to unite along
The righteous with a walk in success and be strong.
Instead of lookin' for someone to beef with,
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
Rappers of today like (Kid'N'Play),
Hey, even my man L.L. Cool J,
(Stetsasonic) and EPMD,
Public Enemy and (BDP),
Salt 'N' Pepa 'cause we can't sever never,
Wheihter, whatever, we better stand together.
That means unite, not fightin' or fussin' or cussin'.
Save all the base for the pipe and start lovin'
One another 'cause separation is a flaw,
So endure for more and stop lookin'; for...

9,Big Daddy Vs. Dolemite,1990,Taste of Chocolate (1990),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Big Daddy Kane)
Mmm... oh yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, oh yeah
Allow me to introduce myself
As the Big Daddy Kane
A smooth lover from around the way
That's bound to drive any bitch insane
(Dolemite (Rudy Raw Moore))
Well Dolemite is my name
And rappin' and tappin is my game
(Kane)
Oh yeah? Well me tell you somethin' Mr. Dolemite
The shit you talkin' years ago, I could see
But it's the 90's now and rap is all about me
(Dolemite)
Listen... when it comes down to rappin'
I was THROUGH with it before you learned what to do with it
I'm the KING so I'm stakin my claim
In the rappin' game
Y'know? For all players, I am the speaker
I'm also known as the hot pussy seeker
When it comes down to ridin' up and down in some pussy
I make it weaker
Also it gets a little deeper
I was walkin' down Broadway the other day
An old old lady came my way
She said, ""I'll be glad when you 'come 18
I'm gonna give you a funkin like you ain't never seen!""
I said, ""LADY! Why wait for so much time to pass?
I've been WANTIN to tear up yo' old gray ass""
So I pulled out my dick
It was so shiny it looked like it was painted
The hoe took one look and damn near fainted
I stuck it in the bitch and the bitch began to shout
That, ""Oh Mr. Dolemite, take that motherfucker OUT!""
(Kane)
Well you ain't sayin' nothin' slick to a can of oil
I walked barefoot from New York to Dallas
Won for Pimp of the Year at the Caesar's Palace
Made a big snowstorm on the 4th of July
And drunk the waters in the Atlantic Ocean till that shit was dry
I was makin' money before Washington was put on a bill
And I kicked Jack's ass and took his hoe Jill
I'm the one who broke the bull's back
And made people say FUCK McDonald's and call ME the Big Mac
(Dolemite)
Why you long lanky motherfucker
You ain't nothin' but a sucker!
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives
Shot in the ass with two Colt .45's
I've been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel
I chew up railroad iron, and shit out steel!
I jumped in the ocean and swallowed a whale
Handcuff lightning and throw THUNDER's ass in jail
(Kane)
Why you ignorant decrepit motherfucker
Let me tell you somethin'
I'm the one that put the M in mackin
Because when you did it you was only actin'
I made pimpin' a full time job
So bitches wouldn't have to go out and rob
I made the streets of New York hot as a SAUNA
And hung a Home Sweet Hoe sign on every corner
Yes I'm the player of all players and the mack of all macks
Give a headache to Excedrin and knock the SHIT out of Ex-Lax
(Dolemite)
Why you insecure no business barn junkyard
Rat soup eatin motherfucker!
It was in the early 1960's when I originated my pimpin' game
I was callin whores jives ass bitches
And pimps - sucker ass lame
KANE, before you can take my reign
You gotta cook me a chicken and a half a day
Walk from New York to Los Angeles and throw the bones away
You gotta be BORN BLIND and cannot see
Yo' bitches have the POCKS in the ass so bad they can't even pee
Ride a bald eagle a million feet in the AIR
And get out and do the runnin' man while you up there
Have the Mumps and the Asiastic Flu
And the Crabs around yo' ass start singin' the Yankee Doodle Doo!
(Kane)
Aww fuckit I give up"
10,Big Daddy's Theme,1989,It's a Big Daddy Thing (1989),,Big Daddy Kane,"Yo, Tone... Play me some more pimp shit...
When I was living my house this morning, the young lady I was wed, she said to me: Big Daddy, don't go, big daddy, please pleasee, don't go
I said: Baby, I got to go take care of businnes... And you know... The ROMANCE without FINANCE is a damn NUISANCE... They don't recognize..."
11,Brooklyn Style...Laid Out,1994,Daddy's Home (1994),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Chorus: Big Daddy Kane)
Come on y'all and feel the groove
Get on down and make your move
Welcome to the funkiest
Brooklyn style, laid out like this
(Big Daddy Kane)
I kicks the flavor good, to represent the neighborhood
Where I come from, and that's the place of Brooklyn
Where the grimies are born and bred
And bullets are like eyeballs, two to the head
(Scoob)
Well is it Brownsville? Time to represent for the map
Where the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps
The party addict about to explode
From the 1-1-2, the double-3 ill zip code
(Big Daddy Kane)
Parlayin on the corner, drinkin' 40's shootin cee-lo
It's a Brooklyn thing, aight? You know our steelo
And for those who just don't know how it go
Play like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know
(Scoob)
So yo, who wanna set it? You better kick your best G
You and your whole entourage couldn't test me
I represent for the fo' main
And if you're not a booty bandit, then niggaz can't hang
(Big Daddy Kane)
Now, let's get straight down to the point
I represent for this Brooklyn joint, baby pah, where we're takin' it to
Makin' a few dollars don't mean you gotta forget
Where you come from and try to be someone, that you're really not
And front with what you got
You're gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real
What type of mission can I say you on?
Because you musta done changed to some Grey Poupon, heh
I'm really happy to see you blew up
But always remember my man you grew up
In the PJ's all your life, in a broken home
(Scoob: Well all right now)
Up in the PJ's all your life, keepin' it strong, WHAT!
I be the Louis Ave livin', live long lastin lover
Bonafied black brother, word to the mother
Skilled at trades at hand with those who made
The man with support and always stayed a fan
My dialectic style is perfected
In ways you can't imagine rap bein accepted
Funk'll slam like a doper jam, pops
I'm takin' mine like taxes with Uncle Sam
So check out the asiatic type of flow
Like water in the Nile, but it's Brooklyn style
(Scoob)
Yo, this is Big Scoob, no practice
I'm flippin on niggaz like little kids on that mattress
You know my style, Baby Pah from the PJ's
My lyrics so dope, they too fat for local DJ's
So hear me out, no doubt, no need for screamin
My boys in the back, clockin your jewels, and they scheamin
Why did they step to me, I hit em, bow, bu-dow
Knocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile
No need for beef chief I'm rollin' mad deep
So pick up your teeth, I got him shakin like a leaf
Not tryin' to scare you, I just wanna aware you
I bet you won't even look at my face (WHAT WHAT WHAT) I dare you
Yo nigga please, yo I'm nice with these
While you're guardin your grill, I'll be beatin' up your kidneys
Me and my boys with the fat tec 9's
With my joint cocked back, in case a punk tried to take mines
Where I'm from there's no need for hesitation
We cock and squeeze, now where's the doctor for this patient?
He's drippin blood and now he's down to his last breath
But he won't make it, 'cause he knows that my joint is def
The ill, type of Brooklyn artist
Who rocks the har-dest, regard-less
Who you know and where you're from I pull your file
(How?) Brooklyn style"

Aiyyo, I got you covered like an umbrella

Well, I got a little rap thing I wanna breeze through
(Kane)
So may I release you?
(Shane)
Oh oh, please do
(Kane)
So lil' daddy, my ace, my brother
Get on the mic and let's rock with one another
(Shane)
And, here comes the six foot four, the rough and raw
To blow up the mic with rhymes you like
I strike the stage in a rage and burn just like a twelve gauge
Shotgun, cause son, the shane is not the one
The noise bringer, humdinger, funky rhyme stinger
Bring your girl to my show and I'ma swing her
The lil' daddy got it down pat, yeah
I'm like the name heavy d, I sound fat
Word for word, line for line, uh
I gets mine and show I'm poetically in-clined
If rap was made by ? then redeemed because
You ain't got no ahhhhhice creeeeeeeeam
So take a seat in the rear
Don't dare to compare, 'cause I swear, you gets nothin' here
The way you see me knock out the next brother
You'd think my moms had a talk with ll's mother, huh
Aiy-yi-yi-yah, momma mia
Man I burn the next MC like gonorrhea
Knock the boots on a girl named althea
Then pull her friend by the name of maria

Oh oh, please do

So big daddy, my ace, my brother
Get on the mic, and let's rap with one another
(Kane)
When I grab the microphone and shout
You gotta spread out, spread out, spread out, spread out
I'm ready to rip it apart, I hit 'em with one of the rhymes
I'm rough in a flash, trash, bash, crash, smash slash mash
Run for shelter, no one can help ya
You pushed up on a heavyweight, when your rhymes are welter-
-Weight that's right, wait, because you're not fitted
*Singing* you're never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Uh, I'm what you call a rap legend
And definitely the last MC to be present
Don't even try to take mines
You fuckin' new jack, you still got price tags on your rhymes
Yo what's that sayin' that hammer says uh
U can't touch this, just like a pimple yo I'ma bust this
I'm like steven segall, _out for justice_
As for competition, pssssssh, what's this?
You're not prepared too, rappers are scared too
Confront this, cause you know damn well you don't want this
Some good advice is just break out
Before I treat you like a fast food restaurant and take-out
As soon as I see the microphone yo I'ma, seize that
Squeeze that, a battle, you better, freeze that
'Cause if you go through the wrath of kane, uh
Not even lisa fisher can ease the pain, so

'Cause I cried on Cooley High when Cochise died
But then again at times I may be a mean fellow
'Cause I didn't give a damn about the dog Old Yeller

I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done
So, let me lick you from head to toe
Realllllllll slowwwwwwwww
Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung
Just by the movement of my tongue
I remember it all started way back
In ummm... Kindergarten!
Some played with Lego's, some played with Play-Doh
But I was feelin' girls like a ripe tomato
And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk
Lockin up girls like I want
Yes I got a harem, but I don't share em
I collect 'em like padium and MMM, you gotta see em
Because the ladies is all I dream of
And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love
You know why?"

I put it down till you girls catch a cramp,
Take a little trip with the smoothest guy walkin'
Usually my fault in, girls wreckless eyeballin
Attraction is magnetic, they come and get it
Game is all natural, yours is synthetic
So while you sittin' there tryin' to get your words straight
I bag more dimes than workers at the herb gate
Use tight D, on top of tight G
Want it done rightly, girlfriend invite me
I foresee what you hoping,
And say the right thangs to get you open, then I get you open
Lay it down from nighttime until the A.M.
Watch how I play 'em, lay 'em and then fillet 'em
In the kingdom I hit it like lottery
Baby you gotta see, the Brooklyn prodigy
It's plain to see, your game is tight enough for me
I jus can't keep my cool, I just gotta let it be
And now you're in the zone
And I'm sure when you play on
That the way you put it down
Is gonna change this game around
Sharp P-I till I return to the essence
Making my presence, glow like florescence
I come around and get it like hot peas and butter
Drop these and got her, that Kane he's a mother
The God don't minimize, I enterprise, when I rise
In the thighs, make 'em see doubles like geminis
So, bring it on me no sweat it
But you talk that Lil' Kim talk to me and end up bowlegged
Give it to you good upon the mattress
6 million ways to get yo' back twist
No theatrics when the Kane approach
Put you in more positions than a football coach
Pimpin' ain't easy but we don't knock it do we
Instead we spend chips, get fly, rockin' jewelry
Walk through the club with the girls lockin to me
It's all love in here baby now sock it to me.
I don't discriminate they come upon ease
Asians, Haitians, even the mommies
Please lowdown stankin', plus Jamaican girl bangin'
Them call me yard boy cause them seen something hangin'
Never do I waste that, I put my face at, a place that
In case I wanna taste that
Comfort specialist, is as easy as this
Ah miss, yeah duke you better hold your on to her wrist
I start roamin like car phones, and
Just can't control my hormones and
I make a move on a ten, and go and get a friend
So I can put my man in
While you sittin' there drinkin', that glass of Cris
I be sittin' there thinkin', what's after this
Us two, me and you is what's happenin'
Bodily in heat like an African (O.K.)"

And give the child room, to blossom and bloom
Livin' large, it's your destiny to consume
To take flight and ignite to a brand new height
Cause that's your goal in life - am I right? (Yeah!)

Yo, I break punks up like a fight. give me the mic, I'm hype.
(Damn kid, you're starvin' for life)
'Cause people be tellin' me, brothers be gellin' me,
Tryin' to get fame from my name but they chumps and they butt-soft.
They know I'm wilder than a dog with hot sauce.
A mic, a stage, a crowd, and I won't stop:
I set it off and get live like an alarm clock.
People thought scoob and scrap was just a nickname;
Now that we rap, we sell more records than cocaine.
Awww, shucks, now I'm back from the down-low,
Here comes scoob with the currrr-ly afro.
No chemical reaction, no need for askin', pure satisfaction,
My last name's jackson.
You slip up, I get ill -- my boot to your grill,
My nine kills, I'm big scoob from brownsville.
The world's greatest lover, the chaaaaa-clate brother...
Who's the committee? (chocolate city!) 3x
Scrap lover are ya with me?
{Scrap lover:}
Yo, I drop science kinda like a pigeon;
Over rough tracks I tax any midget with a small digit.
Smooth and mild but complicated,
I put the crowd to to smashed like a driver that's intoxicated.
Rappers write rhymes, and talk about guns and jail,
But wouldn't squeeze a lemon in a cocktail.
Don't say ""huh? "" or ""what? "", and don't ask who,
'Cause if you hear me, I must be talkin' to you.
You probably thought I couldn't steal it, 'cause I was a dancer,
I didn't have a chance, but y'all can kill it.
You gotta be off your rocker,
I'm lettin' suckers know that scrap got more soul than foot locker.
And if you heard I got skills, believe it's true;
Suggest for pete rock, for reminiscin' over you.
It's not a threat, it's a bet, 'cause hey,
The last sucker who tried woulda been 25 today.
Big daddy are ya with me?

Yo-yo-yo-yo, look out, get out the way!
Here comes the k the a the 'n' the e -- huh, ya better flee.
'Cause I don't need no hoodie to be hard, shoot:
I'll kill a nigga in a three-piece suit.
I don't be havin' it so the rear I'll attack,
A size-15 to the buttocks, a-matter-fact.
A hard-core blow to the face I'll provide,
To give you a crooked eye, just like st. ides.
Leave you home and you must be screamin' and yellin';
Not een kool moe dee shades can hide your swellin'.
I bring it rough, tough;
I said that I was browner than bobby, so you know that it's good enough.
I'm untouchable to rappers my size.
You dreamed of beatin' me, you better wake up an apologize.
Some claim to be a daddy or poppa,
But with me, you'd have no ranks if your name was shabba.
Now you know you'd too like to be with it...
{Li'l daddy shane:}
Shane, I cause pain, I make it rain.
I'm wearin' and tearin' down to the last grain.
Ha, I'm not a chocolate brother, but I don't mourn,
'Cause I swear this vanilla kid got it goin' on.
So don't even step to me if you're worth nothin',
Because I just might hurt somethin'.
My competition thinks twice, 'cause yo, for a young nigga, I'm kinda nice...

19,Come On Down,1991,Prince of Darkness (1991),,Big Daddy Kane,"Verse One: Big Daddy Kane
When I'm in motion it's just like the flow of the ocean
The weight of the words swerve and curve
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas
Quick as a Lambourghini, smooth as a Lexus
I guess that makes me the top of the line
Oh yes I'm the most prime of all time
Cause as soon as I pick up the mic and begin and the lyrics just start
To flowing, ahem ahem, coughing couldn't stop me from going
On with the rapture, so that I can capture
Your mind with state of the art music made to adap to
To knowledge the God on the groove
Because when my tongue moves I just loooove that I'm smooth
Do it with these and in times I leave reas
To give 'em a little of thje flavor that please
As I, school in the who in pursuin and doin' and reignin again and the
Gutter and stutter and killin' and chillin' collectin the rent and
Jammin and slammin' and damn it's
Too much for one mind to comprehend
A pure blend, the way that I make words mend
And, the way that I be doin' rappers in
Michael Bivins couldn't make these Boyz II Men
I play, somethin' verbally, capable to murder the
Average MC, the tough ones I'll burn third degree
And if you're thinkin' that I'm takin' a beatin'
You're sure to see the Pink Panther speakin'
Verse Two: Q-Tip
I'm a native New Yorker, I pitch a lot of porker
When I get my ride, I be the grill squawker
Tip's a smooth talker, I love Alice Walker
So get off the dillz and step back you little hawker
Better yet you hooker, you wanna show I book ya
The highest way I took ya, is youse a good looker
Queens is residential, I make the presidentials
Over instrumentals, I utilize the mentals
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square
If you wnet in by yourself it was a terror
See, I could do that cause my crew is kinda phat
Outside we had the toolies, out West you call 'em gats
It's that, oh thanks chat, well let me drop some more shit
Bring your bats and balls and please don't forfeit
Cause you won't get away, your status will be stank
You can ride with me G I'm goin' to the bank
To meet up with Kane, up on Dollar Lane
You get the idea, cause page times is near
So rappers see they bug 'cause they really can't handle
Position from the rappin', cause some of them be slackin'
Not in this sport of thought we block out the devil
The three different flavors, you know we on the level
Verse Three: Busta Rhymes
Check it out, uh! As I come down and get dumb
Yes roughneck, swingin' along with the drum
Swimmin in the, track, retaliatin thorough is how
I react, Busta Rhymes will attack
As you feel the pain, bass kick impacts to the brain
Gotta make a mega migraine
Whattup? To the Big Daddy and Tip
My trip, flip the rhyme, then I dip
Hey, hip-hop, cool, bust the interlude
Wack do ya on the stage gettin' booed
This structure it takes, bust the angle of three different flavors
On a young raider choc well that's my vocal fader
Keep my volume on extra boom!
All the braids in my neck symbolizes that I want room
Word up, huh! Here I am, damn
Dragon slayer stackin layer after layer
This jam will be ran while the record flim flam
WIggle your front pram, to the runnin' man
Sam, Busta, Rhymes, comin' on time
L.O.N.S. did, rip a new design
Flavor one, taste the unborn baby
Flip before you move or catch a bad one baby
CHiggy change chump, the oversized puff
Busta pump you and the love, and then I rump
Emotional stter point, for the wild
Busta buckwild musically direct from Strong Isle
Unload, catch you like smell later

Like 8 bars, then I want you to come in with a scratch -

What? nah man, we ain't havin' that!
Just trip, I'm tired of every record we do
I got to be jiggin-jiggin this, jiggin-jiggin that
You know what I'm saying?
Yo, it's time for me to get busy on the mic by myself
On the solo tip, you know what I'm sayin'?
So yo, step back and let me show you how a real DJ rocks
As I kick it like this:
{DJ Mister Cee:}
A DJ gets no damn credit
Don't look at me funny, Kane cause, yeah, I said it
I'm always in the background
Supplyin the sound, but my props is yet to be found
Besides, when you're kickin a rap
The only other people you can see is Scoob and Scrap
So y'all get the girls, okay
But I bet you wasn't gettin' skins scratchin for Shante
And the first time a record skips
You catch an attitude and always tryin' to flip
Now ain't that a bitch
I swear one of these days I'm gonna pull the power switch
'Cause I'm always breakin my neck
10 in the mornin you were sleepin' on my sound check
And when it's time for the show
I'm supposed to go (Big Daddy) (hell no)
Am I a man or a machine?
Or just a fat kid who don't supposed to be seen?
Don't you know you wouldn't be so amazin
If I wasn't helpin you out, you black raisin
And you got the nerve and try to complain
Makin' a record sayin' 'it's hard bein the Kane'
Hmm, but all you gotta do is rap
Try carryin some console cases on your back
Well, I'm through with breakin my neck
Until you learn to show your DJ some respect
Because without me you'd be butt-naked
So from now on, spin your own damn records
Now put your weight on that shit here
Yeah (yeah) (x5)
I'm outta here"
21,Dance With The Devil,1990,Taste of Chocolate (1990),,Big Daddy Kane,"C'mon... * echoes *
Swing your partner, I'm about to start the
Dance across the land, the Kane will scar the
People of our community, 'cause we're soon to see
The future of the world to be without unity
So brothers and sisters, let's check our history
To reveal what's been hidden a mystery
Because we're headed for self-destruction
And you know that the government, doesn't give a (fuck) when
One black brother sells another one dope
And he can't cope, so he dies without hope
Many of us live on this level
Mislead victims who dance with the devil"
22,Death Sentence,1991,Prince of Darkness (1991),,Big Daddy Kane,"I break out in a cold sweat, rip up the whole set
I'm about as bad as you can get
Comin' from Bed-Stuy, that's where they do or die
Forget about the lions and tigers and bears, oh my
It's not a fairy tale, a myth, it's a musical uplift
And I'm the wrong one to mess with
I roll on rappers like a Cherokee, bake 'em up merrily
Just like the cooks at Sara Lee
Erase, replace, disgrace, and chase, unlace your face
And place a neck brace, about-face
And get to steppin', because my lethal weapon
Is blowin' too fast, while you're slow as Catherine Hepburn
What you need is a little more speed, style and flavor
But it still wouldn't save ya
So to the rear, step off and let the man flex
'Cause I can hang tighter to the groove than spandex
I snatch the mic with grace, always with a plan
And Cee'll cut the recored up like Edward Scissorhands
Rock the soul shack, I can't hold back
Four years standin' and I still got the knack
'Cause I remember when I first did it
The comments that were goin' around from the next critic
Like ""Yeah, he sound all right, but still will he hold?""
And now my black ass is still here like Billy Joel
One hip-hopper that don't have to sound proper
My broken English you can still distinguish
And I don't have no image or no gimmicks
And I don't have no bounds or no limits
The Kane'll keep goin', and growin', and flowin'
And showin' any MC, I got the best finesse to manifest
'Cause I pull cards like some type of retard
Hittin' MCs hard, and any other Rass Claaad
I'm the predator to any competitor
Scorchin' and damagin' and stompin' et cetera
And any MC that tries to test me
I'm swellin' up his jaws mor than Dizzy Gillespie
Crushin' all dreams you thought were possible
I turn into nightmares you have in the hospital
I couldn't count the rappes I be servin'
If defeat was sex, huh, I'd be a virgin
My match ain't been found, movin' around, breakin' 'em down
Where the ground, never the clown, how that sound?
Don't get gassed, 'cause boy you won't last
So take your crippled rhymes and put 'em in a cast
You're too pathetic, bring in a paramedic
To heal your sick rhymes, 'cause man, you ain't poetic
You're just a cheap little hooker and I gotta overlook a
MC that's wack, ya little bogger
And stand clear of the mic that I'm rippin'
As I'm...???
And get your jury and a good defendant
'Cause I'm servin' a death sentence..."
23,Definitely,1998,Veteranz' Day (1998),,Big Daddy Kane,"In this corner, representin' BK, NY
Who, come again, I
That you can't deny
For the while I stayed, laid back in the shade
Just like a silhouette, however still a threat
Once again, I return just to get my groove on
Bag somethin' that's a size 7/8 and move on
It be nothin' but dime girls I sport
Only time I hit a 3 be on the basketball court
What you thought, the wrath was about to end
Nah baby, never that because I'm out to win
So what if he came back, he ain't even hittin' though
So why you standin' there with yo' nails bitten low?
MC's tremblin', I plead innocent
But then again, things can get menacin'
Ladies and Gentlemen it's the world renown
Come on y'all let's get down, Dark Gable's in town
Put your hands up high if you testify
Are you wit' me? (Definitely)
'Cause I give it all I got when I rock the spot
Are you wit' me? (Definitely)
Ain't gon' be no looking tight, we gon' party tonight
Are you wit' me? (Definitely)
One hundred percent proof, help me raise the roof
Are you wit' me? (Definitely)
It's somethin' æ´out that Kane that I just ain't buying
How can his rap be solid when his flow is liquefying?
He keep it on beat, plus he keep it street
Plus he keep it sweet, I mean his shit be complete
Thank you love that's right keep it real for me
As I run it down to you all skillfully
Because it ain't hard to tell who's the liver one
Got 'em all shooken like Allen Iverson
See, you talking now but you ain't sayin' nothin'
I keep you listeners hittin' the rewind button
You thinkin', maybe I'm the one to bring it to
But, I don't think that's the wise thing to do
Another casualty with the audacity, thinkin' that he can last with me
Fast to see how I massively, drop skills gradually
Hold it down like gravity, naturally
I come wit' the flows that go down like water
Some of y'all just ain't got your game in order
Hmn, looks to me as though you're simpin'
Playa hata's that's attemptin', to be the grinch that stole pimpin'
I cram to, understand you, what's your angle?
You don't want to tangle
Actin' all brand new
Nothin' that them can do, when I roll up like bamboo
And dismantle, handle, everyone I ran through
Baby, you can count on me, a sure thing
I be all inside your hood, just like a drawstring
The wack, I restrict 'em, rhymes I kick 'em
Girls I just stick 'em, whose my next victim?
Thinkin' you was ballin', now I'm callin
Yo' bluff (Uh huh), sho nuff (Well all right)
Who you came out to see in the place to be
The ebony black ice, who that be?
(Yours truly)"
24,Do U Really Know?,1998,Veteranz' Day (1998),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Kane talking)
Here's a little food for thought,
As I tell it, 'cause if it happened to this cat,
Then it can happen to you,
Do the knowledge
(Song starts)
I was sittin' outside double parked after dark,
I think it was the corner of Nostrand and St. Mark,
That's when this stray cat walked up to me,
Now I was sure he would be,
But you woulda thought he'd know me,
Tellin' his life story to me,
He said 'Yo Kane', since way back in his life,
Days of Rappers Delight, yo he was after the hype,
He rocked the Kangols, Adidas when Run and them had that spot,
When I came out, he had a flat-top,
And when Naughty came out, a couple years ago,
He even tried the braids up in his hair, but they ain't hear him tho,
Vexed and down, you know next he found,
Heavy D was blowing up, so then he tried to gain extra pounds,
No thanks to that, they ranked him wack,
Only thing that's left to do, was to go gangsta rap,
So now he rhyme about the keys being sold,
The G's being fold, the trees being rolled,
Now sure he should, he started acting like he from the hood,
Talking thug game and had his record sales doing good,
And so now, you on the road to riches,
Referring to the womankind as hoes and bitches,
Yeah, you the man now because you rap is for ?????,
But you got your 7 year old daughter listenin',
The twist begin,
When that the image you projecting,
It starts to reflecting on your shorty 'cause she checking,
Do you really know,
What's the path that you really need to go,
And what example you really need to show,
The good rep or the hood rep,
While she's walking in her father's footsteps
It be that excess drama, wonder rhymer,
That could make one rapper, convert to, gun clapper,
That acting buckwild, boy you know that ain't your style,
Plus your thug profile is now reflecting on your child,
You thinking that it couldn't happen,
But then it happen,
And now you're rappin', came back to haunt you,
Because you want to,
Be in her face puffin' li with your crew,
You even let her take a sip or two upon your brew,
Instead of tryin' to shed light, to keep her head right,
So that she wouldn't do the things that the next kid might,
Oh now you never did consider tho,
Your kid could go,
Trying to do the things she saw you do up in your video,
You went upstairs thinking that she wasn't able,
Slipping, left your glock sittin' pon the coffee table,
So as you hang, with your gang, doin' your thang,
BLOWE! unexpectedly to your ears the shot rang,
Came down, never thinking that you'd see what you saw,
Right there, layin in blood across your livin' room floor,
So now, as you sit in grief, total disbelief,
Cause everything that ever mattered,
To you is all shattered,
Instead of concentratin' heavily on what your rep be,
You should have been thankful for your child like Cheryl Pepsi,
'Cause if you would have stayed aware,
To whose in your care,
She wouldn't be no casualty to your career""
Where did they find you?,
You came into this game and let this new trend blind ya,
A&R's was wrong to sign ya,
You gotta be true to this game to stay in the art,
But guys like you get bent apart,
Because you ain't got it in the heart,
Representing who? you better not be getting new,
How you gonna be guerilla when you never been up in the zoo,
Your whole persona's theatrical,
Ain't nothing 'bout you natural,
Here, show me now, how many gats you pull,
'Cause when you talk that talk,
You gotta walk that walk,
Or leave it up to the real OG's up North,
Cause those who dramatize, realize, and be advised,
You couldn't handle 3 to 5,
Cause many seeking fortune and fame,
Got caught in the game,
Thinking the thug status was supporting the claim,
All you gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks,
But relax, cause this is just wax,
Tell 'em again,
You gangsta acts be guerillas on tracks,
But relax, cause this is just wax,
One more time,
Y'all gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks,
But relax, this just wax, nigga, damn"

Hey yo, drop it like it's hot, kane, drop it like it's hot
Yo, pick up the microphone and gimme what you got
{Big daddy kane:}
Hey yo, drop it like it's hot, scoob, drop it like it's hot
Pick up your microphone, it's time to rock the spot
(x2)
(Oh my god, tell me, is it really him?
The legendary lyricist makin' matters grim?)
Because when I start to flow the results are so deadly
Rappers start shakin like the legs on elvis presley
Sayin' (it's him, the great) that's how I intimidate
But I just came to get my shit off, so I give them a break
And pickin' up the microphone after I left
Is like givin' mouth-to-mouth to a corpse, a waste of breath
In other words, I don't leave no remains for you
(Forget the men, that's the evil that kane'll do)
I bring it raw, gee, too hardcore, gee
The only way you could fuck with me is in a orgy
The magnificent, none can come swifter than
Cool as ? ? ?, but my skin color is different
We got the milk and honey
My rhymes are just like abraham lincoln's face (on the money)
Makin' me freshest on the land, but let's not forget
That if I rapped under water they'd be aquafresh
The best, oh yes, I guess... (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
- You said that shit in '88)
Oh, I originate and create the great to dictate
And regulate chumps and set 'em straight
I get my point across because the boss is truly yours
The source to the force, so put it on pause
The one that assures applause, never took a loss
Stronger than some olde e quarts to a can of coors
In other words it's hazardous to your health
So don't do it to yourself
Don't do it to yourself, don't do it
Yo, you better not do it, you better not
(x2)
(Stop right there, you better freeze, cease
Don't make me put my timberland boot to your grill piece
Big scoob from brooklyn comin' through, don't start me
Don't make me turn your jam into a tec-9 party)
Hey yo, what in the world would ever possess you
To think that you could touch me
Or even try to come above me
Or even think that you could flow this lovely?
Nobody, and I mean nobody on this whole planet can stand it
I rip it apart, and flip up the art 'cause I'm the best, damn it
I crush rappers for the hell of it, defeat, I never tell of it
So anything else you heard is irrelevant
(You're not on the level) man, you're not even close to me
(Step to the kane) and get bagged just like grocery
So spare yourself the misfortune and proceed with caution
'Cause I don't just burn rappers, I torch em
With a skilled-out style that's mad diesel
And I got hemorrhoids from shittin on so many people
I crush those who oppose with blows to your nose
When it comes to my crew (that's the way love goes)
The chocolate city for black cesar incorporated
(And all of the soft get faded)
So before you step to me use your head
And you better think about it more than special ed
Cause trust me, kid, it ain't like goin' against anyone else
I'm tellin' you, don't do it to yourself"
26,Down The Line,1990,Taste of Chocolate (1990),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Kane)
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Attention to the whole crew
Scoob Lover, Scrap Lover, I don't need your dancin
Mister Cee I don't need you on the turntables
Ant Live I don't need you collectin the dough
And Little Daddy since you my brother
Get yo' ass on in here
'Cause we gettin' ready to take things down the line
Here we go one time
Prepare yourself for MC terror
And don't make the error of tryin' to come near a
Rapper so smooth and swift with the gift of gab
To grab the mic, 'cause I'm sorta like
Vincent Price, but you never been so nice
So back up off me, I'm seperatin men from mice
Kickin ass in every committee, city to city
Until both shoes are city
The regulator innovator dominator creator of data
Plus an imitator assassinator
Lyrics don't display a too don sweet
Hard as concrete, and always on beat
Steppin to this, you're not allowed
You keep frontin on the stage like you're rockin' the crowd
Snatchin the microphone real proud
But your rhymes are so booty you should write 'em on White Cloud
So next up down the line, Scrap Lover
(Scrap Lover)
Aiy-aiy-yo, the microphone's mine
But I prefer peace, so the road'll get rough when
A toy MC, gets the heart to pull a bluff and
There's no laughter, cause the one that I'm after
Is smashed, for that reason you have to
Make sure each and every lyric is harmless
'Cause if not, you won't be able to calm this
Brother from Brooklyn, made to fit a groove
And prepared for the unexpected, to make a move
So put up your girl, and let's see who's in trouble troop
And if you got a sister, then make it a double scoop
The capital S the C, the R-A-P
Stands for me, 'cause I'm the
Only MC with an original rap style
You disagree, you get put on the Scrap pile
So stay off the set, with George and Jet-son
You never seen a dancer who rapped well you met one
Now spin the Wheel of Fortunes or be wise and stay back
Co-host my show, like Pat and don't Sa-jak shit
Or get ate like oats and barley
Save your Sweat for Keith, and the Beef for Charlie
So next up, goin' down the line, Scoob Lover
(Scoob Lover)
Yo, the microphone's mine
It's the S y'all, to the C y'all, double-O B y'all
Well god damn it's me y'all
Jump back, kiss myself, I'm so fly
Sip a brew or two, cause yo, I don't get high
I might wave hi...
... At a pretty young girl that walk by
But yo, you all that, you can't stop?
A-with the weave in your head like a mop?
You must know karate, cause your face look chopped
Now back to the subject of the matter
I eat a lot of food, but I won't get fatter
Let me see I'm slim, my hair is well trimmed
And when I'm low-key I throw on a brim
But I'm not conceited, when hangin' out I need it
For when trouble comes then I never have to meet it
I'm intellectually spoken, I'm not jokin
What are you, smokin'?
You be hopin wishin and prayin'
To be like Scoob but what are you sayin'?
Well it takes style, charisma, class
Fuck up on the Lover, and I bust your ass
So next up, movin down the line
Mister Cee
(Mister Cee)
Yo, the microphone's mine
Mission, to make DJ's feel the wrath
So here's a paragraph, written on behalf
Of the ruler, dictator, DJ ambassador
Makin' a massacre, you couldn't last through a
Round of combat, where my left arm's at
My mouth with the mic in my hand, when I attack
I shake and bake or fake a snake
Take 'em and make 'em ache and flake, I break like an earthquake
When I erupt, MC's I corrupt, to be blunt
I'ma tear shit up
So next up goin' down the line
The Little Daddy Shane
(Little Daddy Shane)
The mic is all mine
MC's crawl by when they see this tall guy
Six foot three huh, nobody's small fry
The Little D-A double-D Y
The S-H-A-N-E, yes it's me
You better believe there's no comp and I'm certain
So if you try to battle me, then it's cur-tains
I'm no joke, the wrong one to provoke
One false move and KERRRRRR-ROAK!
So take it easy and slide on greasy
'Cause I'm more rougher than hair when it's peasy
I'm more rougher than steak when it's raw
So keep that in mind, mon cherie amore
'Cause I'm a lover you find quite young
And Brooklyn New York, is where I'm from
So keep it on and you don't quit
That supercalafragilisticexpalidopeshit
So next up down the line, Ant Live
(Ant Live)
Yo, the microphone's mine
Yeah I took it, I ain't gonna give it back
And it's a fact that I can swing, I'm not a new jack
Got the mic in a chokehold, you won't hear a peep
Then I put it to sleep
I see a lot of brothers got raisins in the place
Not Al Pacino, I don't need a Scarface
But I know, if some shit goes down
I'll turn the whole New York into Bucktown
A 'Face ain't real Scar'red, 'cause I real hard
And I ain't no bullshit bodyguard
Walk the streets to New York and stay alive
All I need is my loaded four-five
And sweet and deadly like a killer beehive
And I can stalk in Fort Greene park and survive...
And my name is Ant Live
(Big Daddy Kane)
Now that's what I'm talkin' bout
That's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' bout
Put your weight on it fellas
Anyway you can get back to work now
Get back to your god damn jobs
And we outta here, love peace and hairgrease"
27,"Earth, Wind & Fire",1998,Veteranz' Day (1998),,Big Daddy Kane,"I'm from Brooklyn, New York City
I be the Earth motherin', smotherin' MC's
Sha Queen covering 360 degrees
See I blow like the wind when I flow to this song
Cause a riot like Kaiser like that then I'm gone
I bring the fire burn it down to the ground
Think of dissin' me, Kane will leave that ass rotisserie (What)
Earth, wind, fire we be those elements
It's evident, as we come to represent
(Sha-Queen)
I feel the need to get iller than
All these fuckin' wack MC's, realest Bitch that ever been
Dropped the hit single that was flying through the roof
I'm lyrical living proof, you can't handle the truth
After you heard me spit, still convinced that you ill
Who you tryin' to fool me or yourself, bitch for real
Everybody know the deal, you ever get a hunch
To fuck around with Sha-Queen, then I know you out to lunch
Break that meaning down, that means disturbed in your mental
And that's absurd, I kick the illest shit you ever heard
Every rhyme to the last line and pronouns and verbs
Too hard to see with your two eyes, then check with your third
My frequency's not tainted with thoughts of whores
That can only get raw on all fours, with sore back doors
Precisely, far from your average girl
So, sit back and shut the fuck up, cause Sha rules the world, word
(A.B. Money)
Listen there was a man in Brooklyn, New York City
Where the guys are fly and the ladies looking pretty
I'm a let you know, that stuff you pop is junk
'Cause when I flow, it's the flava of the month
Hold up don't worry about nothin', tot shit in a smash like crash dummies
This fast money, make me wanna fuck around and blast money
I heard your spot makes a lot and give you props
This deal is hot, runnin' from the cops'll get you shot
But don't sweat it, dry them niggas up like prunes
The war's on like Platoon
Shot through a crowd like a cartoon
Rappin' is fundamental, that's right, re-arranger
Hit you like Mortal Kombat, you in danger
I got the chronic, six million bionic
This rap shit make me wanna scream like Onyx
I'm comin' through, that's right I'm gonna split ya
Soul survivors on this track, we comin' to get ya
Woop, woop, five-o's comin' in the exit
Keys jinglin', nine danglin' to wreck shit
Step into my cypher, haven't you ever heard a
Throwin' four five six, ceelo, to one twenty third a
Earth, wind and fire you bout to learn
We can make the world turn, or make the world burn
The three deadly elements for your concern
Cause anything you want up out of life you got to earn
See now bring it brother well, well
(Big Daddy Kane)
Since hip-hop genesis, I been at this in the mix
In Bed Stuy tenements, rippin' rappers endless
But I won't sit and dwell upon the things I been had
Instead I appear, and take your fuckin' spot like Sinbad
Now, tell me who shall be first to suffer crucial
If you don't know defeat then allow me to introduce you
So how you want it, coming through beatin' ya down
Watching disaster strike when Busta Rhymes ain't even around
The Prince of Darkness be that one man
That made them Al B Sure lookin' niggas get a sun tan
What I drop should not be followed by anyone else
At times I'm scared to kick a second verse after myself
As I proceed, followers take heed
I made many men bleed, I made hairlines recede
This rap skill here, I destined for a mill-aire
And this is one ass whippin' you will wear, you still here?"

Trigger too, even Nas I be digging too
Let's see whose left Mobb Deep, oh yeah Meth
That brother's hot like curry, one love to Keith Murray
Rappers like Craig Mack quench my thirst for comedy
I'd love to hang with Red Man but I ain't messing with that bam bazee
The Brat, Lil' Kim, Foxy get that loochee
Especially that cutie representing for the Fugees, go girls
Even the NBA make rap dollars
Shaquille, Chris Webber, Cedric Ceballos
Talent's around the world Phoenix to Providence
No need to educate Chicago they already got Common Sense
Houston and Atlanta we love you
Peace to the West Coast they really set the Doggs loose
We always say the future's in today's children
If so, make sure Shyheim and A + sell a million
Peace to Eazy E, Stretch, and Mercury
Tupac, and Buffy, Notorious BIG
We gots to strive to make hip-hop survive
Brothers need to unify to keep the game alive
Rappers be coming out with one album then they gone
So with cats like Raekwon, support 'em so they stay on
Then brothers like Smooth wouldn't have to hustle
It's an every day struggle, but hip-hop I still love you
We Entaprizin, got the hip-hop heads realizin'
East Coast, West Coast organizin'
Steady risin', money sizin'
What we specialize in
The fame in the rap game we all want it
In fact by now I hope the Luniz got a hundred on it
And if you're in it for the millions E-40
I hope you see 40, before you be 40
What it look like, the great paper chase for ends
Lost Boyz being found in Lex coups, Bimas and Benz
East Coast, West Coast unite, let's keep it tight
And everything's gonna be all right
But hold up, it seems we got some hip-hop cheats
Depending on just having catchy hooks and beats
Rappers using their skills recently I haven't heard of none
Me, I represent myself better than Collin Ferguson
And yes that I do, I'll shatter you
It don't even matter who, I'll make them all show gratitude
Fools, acting like they don't know the rules
Need to learn to listen when grown folks is droppin' jewels
Now they say, is Mr. Kane coming back to dominate
I used to listen to his music back in 1988
Damn he still pumpin', just when you think he ain't nothing
That kid just keep coming back, what is he the Terminator or something
Lord I skill it in a way to make you feel it
Finally I reveal it, party people they can't wait until-
Starts to boom out, so every rap consumer
Can bring that old schooler back just like alumni
I sting it, booyah, to stop the half steppers tryin' to wing it through ya
Don't make me have to bring it to ya'
Who gonna be the next clown to come step into my bounds
Right now get down for the crown, mess around get pound to the ground by the sound
And let the more experienced entertain
Kane, meet the microphone, microphone meet Kane
The legendaire, rap extraordinaire
Commutin' to your ear, yeah, looka here"
29,Float,1991,Prince of Darkness (1991),,Big Daddy Kane,"Manslaughter, walkin' on water
I stay afloat with a note, the way a boat oughta
I'm too poetically inclined, one of a kind
True and divine the genuine, breakin a bond and gettin' mine
So freeze, I'm makin' it flow with ease
And droppin' the funkiest lyrics that ever been known to MC's
'Cause I can recite it fast, or even rap slow
Huh, man I can just talk and my shit'll flow
Because I mastered the rhythms of winnin' lyric
Hit em, just the flow itself'll tell you that I did em
So let the K-to-the-A-to-the-N-to-the-E
Show you the meaning of real harmony, as I float"
30,Get Down,1991,Prince of Darkness (1991),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Kane)
It ain't hard to tell
The flow of the Kane is movin 'em real well
I build and excel and plus I rap like hell
Lyrics generate, break through and penetrate
Connect like an interstate, now let me demonstrate
I grab the microphone and put the dap in quick
You start to tappin and snappin and clappin
Then rappin'll happen
And then I display, poetry, the right way
And rock the Gladys Knight to the next Morris Day
I get sexy like Marvin Gaye
And other times, I might wanna hit 'em hard and say
Somethin' exquisite and clever like a wizard
Hit 'em like a blizzard if you missed it
Turn to your friend and say, ""What is it?""
Or what was it, because it, was too fast for you to bust it
So pay attention to how the Smooth Operator does it
Just acknowledge the sound
Get on the good foot... UHH, and get down
(Kane)
Look
The thought of competition, I don't have the faintest
'Cause if I'm correct, I kicked them all in the anus
So I don't care if you step to me in three flocks
The men that's all pumped up like Reeboks
'Cause I bring down the swelling, just like alcohol
Makin' 'em all fall like the Berlin Wall
Then I apply pain just like a migraine
Pssssh, man, don't even try Kane
A lyrical catastrophe, a disaster see
Nobody gets on after me
Crushin MC's is how I get my joy
So when one tries to battle I'm like, hoo boy
Class in session as I give the lesson
To prove to another rapper that I rule in his profession
And it's nothin' new, that the Kane is your ruler
Cause back in the days I used to call you Sundullah
Now it's a new time period, rappers are still fearin it
And the crowd is still cheerin
With the new Black Ceaser that came to town
With one purpose - to make you get down
(Kane)
I start to flow, slow, and then oh no
I gotta pick up the pace and go
Go relatin and statin what I'm creatin' to straighten MC's
That I'm debatin terminatin as the Kane keeps them evadin
So step over, cause ain't no leftover
Remains from the Kane I drained the last brain
Speak like Oprah, attack like a cobra
Turn your whole year into a _Red October_
Lyrics are sweet like struddel, at the same time brutal
Your rhymes remind me of the noodle in umm
CHOP SUEY, soft and chewy
My rhymes are kickin like Bruce, you're just Hong Kong Fooey
So +Enter the Dragon+ as I start to raggin
All the competition that's on the bandwagon
I take the groove around around around around around
Around, so get down
(Kane)
Yo, get out your seat and jump to this
Throw your hands in the air and pump your fists
The name of the jam is get down so let me see you do it
And show some unity in music
We gotta show our young ones the right way
To avoid crucial poison and the price they might pay
So I keep on teachin the children to follow the
Power Equality, Allah C Equality, PEACE
...
Mister Cee, you gotta get down and uh
Scoob Lover, you gotta get down and uh
Scrap Lover, you gotta get down and uh
Big Fahl, you gotta get down and my man
Jay-Z, you gotta get down and
Positive K, you gotta get down and
To my man Music Mike, you gotta get down
And to my man Larry, you gotta get down
And to my man Ant Live, you gotta get down
And to my man Big Chuck, you gotta get down
And I can't forget Rog, you gotta get down
And to my man Danny, you gotta get down
And to my main man Sauce, you gotta get down
And to my man Bobby V, you gotta get down
And to my cousin '95, you gotta get down
To my brother the Lil' Daddy, you gotta get down
And to my man Tyrone, you gotta get down
And if I didn't say your name you can STILL get down"

32,Give A Demonstration,2001,The Very Best Of Big Daddy Kane (2001),,Big Daddy Kane,"(VERSE 1: Big Daddy Kane)
Give a demonstration
To the whole rap world rhythm nation
And take a taste of this verbal vibration
With more color than you see on animation
And bear witness to my smooth operation
As I give the party people a sensation
And give them all a good feel of jubilation
Me and the mic become a good combination
To rock the house without any complication
The crowd'll give the Kane a standing ovation
That just gives me even more motivation
To pick up the pace and give you more fascination
With the ryhmes in my rap creation
They show the power of the Kane's innovation
And create an extravagant inspiration
So here I am, to give a demonstration
(Big Scoob)
(Give a demonstration)
(Give) (give a demonstration)
(G-) (give a demonstration)
(VERSE 2: Big Daddy Kane)
Give a demonstration
And take time out for a dedication
To all the deejays and radio stations
Who put my record in heavy rotation
Reprise reps for their affiliation
Of course Warner Brothers help my elevation
For publicity to artist relation
And Rushtown for a great three-year duration
And Carol Lewis for the tour preparation
And Farrakhan for the righteous conversations
I can't forget the people all around the nation
From the adults to the younger generation
The black, white, Chinese and even Haitian
Because the music ain't about segregation
It's a harmony to bring communication
So listen up as I give a demonstration
(Big Scoob)
(Give) (give a) (give) (give a demonstration)
(Give) (g-) (give a demonstration)
(Give a demonstration)
(VERSE 3: Big Daddy Kane)
Give a demonstration
For you to get a much better illustration
And give the sucker MC's an education
Because their style is just a cheap imitation
It seems you need a little bit of dictation
But what I'ma do for you in this situation
Is supply a process of elimination
Serve justice by means of termination
Because a biter only brings aggravation
A lotta trouble and a lotta frustration
So here's a little bit of useful information
So that you can see some acceleration
It's gonna take hard work and concentration
A lotta tears and a lotta perspiration
That's the way that you blow up like inflation
And then maybe YOU can give a demonstration
(Big Scoob)

So can I give a demonstration
For the sick people with constipation
You need to take a little bit of medication
So you can go take a dookie on the toilet
Know what I'm sayin'?
Do you know what I'm sayin'?
So can we give this demonstration?
So yo
Me and Big Daddy
We kickin it on the down low
Word up
Word up, just buggin in the studio
Know what I'm sayin'?
Givin' all y'all party people out there a - little - bit of - de-mon-stration
For the year '91 me and Big Daddy gon' say peace"
33,Give It To Me,1993,Looks Like a Job For... (1993),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Big Daddy Kane)
Ready willin' and able
Here comes the new modern day Dark Gable
On the mattress and on the boxsprings
Girls, they wanna sport me like bamboo earrings
The go-getter, the skins-hitter
And if your girl says she met me... I probably did her
Word up, the sex super stud
I jump your bones like ten Crips against one Blood
(NASTY!) The N-A-S-T-Y
Ready for action if you wanna see why
So come on, and let's do this
As I, tiptoe through your tu-lips
Like Moses, I part them legs like the Red Sea
And then I plant somethin' deadly
Poundin and poundin, is how I'm servin' this
Makin' it look like, your bed is goin' through turbulence
Lots of lust, between the two of us
The sign on my Jimmy says, ""Kidney's or bust,"" so
I shove deeper than the voice of Barry
To make you hit high notes like Mariah Carey
It's like a Morris Day jerkout
To put you in more positions than a Jane Fonda workout
I'm ready to tear down walls
You say let's chill, but to hell with that,
I'm not Aaron Hall, so...
Chorus: repeat 4X"
34,Groove With It,1991,Prince of Darkness (1991),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Kane)
Swing, you get up and dance and do your own thing
'Cause I got the groove to make your eardrums ring
And I bring this, to all the party people that demand most
Funky as Parliament, smooth as Luther Vandross
I wouldn't present myself to you as somethin' that sound nervous
You want it to be live, so here it is at your service
The B the I the G the D-A-double-D-Y
And when it comes to rippin the mic, oh my oh my oh my
I guarantee you by time I'm through
You gotta give me more props than a Motown Revue
And if you thinkin' this groove would ever come to an end
Hah, not from a hair off my chinny chin chin
Chorus: repeat 2X"
35,"Here Comes Kane, Scoob And Scrap",1993,Looks Like a Job For... (1993),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Feat. The Whole Crew)
(Scrap Lover)
SURPRISE! Guess who's on the rise?
And competition, I'm takin', and breakin 'em down to size
I operate around the clock like city bus
Never take five, cause yo when you rest, you rust
Be advised, that I pack heat for beef
I'm knockin' brothers out the box, and knockin' out teeth
Twenty-one years young and I got the knack
(You got it!) to attack and scoop girls like a set of jacks
Ruff rhymes that rag any rap herb
Built by the best to bust swerves like a sharp curve
Fifty percent on wax, no matter of fact
Every nine out of ten rap acts produce a wack track
Twice as nice, but smooth as silk
Somebody writin for Scrap, is like givin' a cow milk
I release, to make it hard for the fellas to cease
'Cause I'm the type to make noise, I don't make peace
Here's a new jack, ready to SWING
And bring the hype type of freestyle rhyme for the crowd to sing
Some say there's a party, but it looks like a job to Scrap
I catch bodies with a nickel-plated rough rap
Me and ?Slap?, we run together through the city
The nitty gritty, always together like titties
By any chance that I do get burnt
You better believe that I'm comin' back, just like a tax return
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
Here we go y'all! (x6)
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
Here we go!
(Scoob Lover)
Move over to the side, let a slim brother wreck it
It's that Scoob Lover kid, so pull up a chair and CHECK IT
When I get wild like Heathcliff, or Dennis the Menace
It's like food to a fat man, finished
I bust your head like a apple (A APPLE)
And pour the blood in a jar, tell your moms that it's Snapple
And wait around my way for your crew, who's next
'Cause I be lookin' out my window with a nine like Malcolm X
There's no comp, they all got stomped so
Dream on... dream away... WELL OKAY!
And play like Shante, and _Have a Nice Day_
I drop rhymes that go boom (BOOM!)
And I can get funky like a high school locker room
Don't even think that I'm country country bamma
Scoob is hittin harder than a heavy heavy sledgehammer
I rock songs to make your grandmother dance
My rhymes are more together than a girl in biker pants
I'm never backed up, I never once had a fronter
Boy I get more beeps than a roadrunner *beep-beep*
I never sweat the girls when it comes to a phone call
I got things sewn up tighter than a football
So skip to my loo or get stomped by my crew
Brooklyn's in the house and ain't a damn thing new
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
Here we go y'all! (x6)
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
Here we go!
(Big Daddy Kane)
Here comes the Prince of Darkness ready to spark this
And show the people just who is the hardest
Ruff and rugged, kind of similar to a nugget
But yet and still, I manage to keep the groove, smoove
Rebel for wreck them rappers I dissect them
Cause anything I say on the mic will affect them (HOW?)
So bad, they gotta run for shelter
So rappers take flight like they work for Delta
They know I ain't havin' it, styles with no crab in it
Fakin and flakin it child, you're sadly mistakin
Cause who's a rapper here that Kane rip on the mic
And start flowin *ZOOM* Yo yo yo, where you goin'?
That's how they flee from me, the B, the I-G
Damn man, you know my pedigree, huh
The gangsta, murdera, killa to ya
For sure endure to injure him or her
The breaker the taker money-maker never a faker
My lyrics are built like Schwarzaneggar
So all my competition gets destroyed
You need to put your weak rhymes on steroid
For you to ever to press up on the mightiest man
To rip a show and flow, provin that competition CAN'T GO
Because I do all, it's easy for you to fall
I move all rappers like my name was U-Haul
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
Here we go y'all! (x6)
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
""And Mister Cee""
""Well it's the Kane""
""Bring me on, and ah""
""Scoob Lover""
""Bring me on, and ah""
""Scrap Lover""
""Bring me on, and ah""
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap Scrap Scrap""
""Well it's the Kane""
""Bring me on, and ah""

36,Hold It Down,1998,Veteranz' Day (1998),,Big Daddy Kane,"Rappers stepped to me, but they didn't get none
I'm the Kane so you know the outcome
The microphone crooner, should have set the tone sooner
Hip hop to me Re boxing to Roy Jones Jr.
The genuine, search and you'll find
That on the microphone I can handle mine
Here's a view to a kill as I flipped the skill
When it's time to rock the mic like Al Scratch I get ill
I come equipped to fight and if I flip tonight
Effects on MC's are similar to kryptonite
Water flows that be hard to distinguish
It's best to relinquish, you don't want the God to bring this
I'm marvelous at the art of this, even if you got assist
Stepping to me is a lot of risk. I release skills that's abundant
To explode and drop on you like flight 800
Keep it moving world renown
Showing and proving
That we can hold it down
Here's a percentage of that old vintage
Macaroni flow but its mare than an image
Don't let the smooth taste fool ya, Let me school ya
On what it is, straight up square biz
Swift maneuvering to crush the crew you bring
Last thing them want tell me is Kane go do your thing who the king
Asiatic non equivalent to any
Plus I play the game a more harder way than Penny
The plan that I mobilize for dough to rise is no surprise
That it comes from what I vocalize
I'm the best you can get as I hit you with
The stroke of death And I ain't even broke a sweat
But this is where I draw the. line you're sure to find
Lyrics I be dropping is too much for the mortal mind
What's being caused is many MC's I'm seeing lost
The hip hop laws should be reinforced
You made a record this year, Oh you're hot
Something fishy about your style, who flow you got
You thought that you could hold me down no you're not
Now back up off me, here I come to blow the spot
All right, here I come to get some
But instead you don't want the love to spread
I heard that jealousy and envy is a dum one's tool
So daddy says nothing he keeps his cool
I been through your tribulations and conflicts
Anything possible to keep me out the mix
But ease back, boy you better freeze that
Where my rivalries lack I'm still nice with these Black
I rap with the safety cap so that you don't get it twisted
And be another statistic
How many more to try, is sure to die
Slaughter I, all that playa hating only makes me fortify
To get the papers to me is a necessity
And I don't want a piece of the pie I want the recipe
I can't lose with what I use
I'm the reason why the lady sings the blues
Don't get it confused"
37,How U Get A Record Deal?,1993,Looks Like a Job For... (1993),,Big Daddy Kane,"On the Black Caesar tip, my dialogue is just like
A frank inside of a supermarket, raw dog
I'm the untouchable, never to be took out
A Sexy Mother... ooh child, Prince look out!
I'm keepin' girls of all shades on my trail
From a Sister Act down to a Single White Female
'Cause when I hit the skins they all say, ""Damn Kane -
You knock out the Bush like a presidential campaign""
But if you think that lickin' toes makes me weak
You better treat me like Freddy Krueger: don't sleep
I write raps, ready to rip and rock real rough rhymes
Run in rugged and raw, rapidly ruinin roaches
Point blank - I spell murder to a bum
All you backwards rappers - REDRUM, REDRUM!
'Cause I do 'em somethin' awful, break 'em down to a morsel
Makin' sure that you're no longer adorable
Rappers get so quiet when I'm comin', that if they
Shitted a dictionary, you couldn't get a word from em
It's sort of a tradition in Bed-Stuy to do or die
So steppin to me is suicide
I couldn't think of a rapper takin' mines
I feel like Ali, ""I'm the greatest of all times""
Floatin like a butterfly, stingin like a bee
Yeah I know this ain't boxin but that's still my pedigree
But as for you, you have no appeal
How you get a record deal?
Like shell-toe Adidas, ain't a damn thing changed
The way I shoot off lyrics like a firin range
Breakin out in a cold sweat - the death threat
Gettin' more props than a movie set
The smooth microphone assassin, rhymes keep blastin
Uh, I keep the body count massive
But if you say you increased the Bodycount troop
You must admit that you joined Ice-T's group
Cause you ain't hurtin' niggedy nothin', so why you bluffin?
Tryin' to be the new Big Daddy SOMETHIN'
But there's only, before me, no one is ?, huh
You couldn't come Pryor if your name was Richard
'Cause I'm the Alpha and Omega
Arm-Leg-uh-Leg-uh-Arm-Head, stayin raw till I'm dead
And to battle me you shouldn't even try
'Cause with wings on your tongue, you still couldn't say nothin' fly
And I don't care if you bring a crew
And I don't even care if someone else writes for you
Man you could even be someone the crowd may just like but shoot
You couldn't see me with a bifocal mic
Check my resume, Rap Masters, word up
Yo! MTV, BET, The Box and all that good stuff
And Billboard for my five year duration
And see that I got more spots than a dalmatian
Let's get down to finish this large
You could bring on your whole squad, none of you chumps are hard
All that garbage you mumble ain't real and seriously, seriously
How you get a record deal?
A lot of rappers today, wonder
Should I ask Kane to write rhymes for me to say?
Well you're god damn right you should
Cause my rhymes are like spandex, they make any ass seem good
So act like you know Baby Pop
When I riggedy rock the higgedy hip-hop non stop, as I
Freak the funk and flip the flavor to flow with the flyest
A fury full force in the flames of the fire, now
May these MC's rest in peace
Because when I come to town, the population decrease
I leave 'em finished, dead and that's that, huh
Not even Pet Semetary could bring 'em back
I slay my pray, A to K, I tell 'em like Jennifer Holiday
No no no no no no way!
That you could ever touch this, no you know how I feel?
I think you bought your record deal..."

Hear ye, hear ye, from far and near
The one they call the Big Daddy Kane is here
To deliver a message to everyone everywhere
So listen up party people cause this you should hear
It's a story of a far-away atmosphere
That you will find very rare and far beyond compare
All is sincere and rather debonair
So let's all gather around, because...
<Hmm... yeah... I'll take you there... oh!> (x4)
Off to a place you thought was unreal
Where people of the world do know how to chill
Everything remains cool and calm where you are
And if you ask about crime, they all'll say, <Hah?!>
They wouldn't even know what you mean
'Cause it's a different program, y'all know the routine
Where people work hard for a decent buck
And you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck
Never wondering whether your house is all right
So go leave your VCR on the porch overnight
And as for the people they all stand proud
Senior citizens party with the hip-hop crowd
You can hang at a jam till the break of dawn
And leave without your Bally shoes getting stepped on
Everyone walks around in their right mind and all
Because crack ain't nothing but a hole in the wall
So those who wish to live with glare and flair
There's a place that this can be done, and yo...
<Hmm... yeah... I'll take you there... oh!> (x4)
What I discovered may just only seem
As something that you find in your wildest dream
But! on the real tip, you will see
I'm not playing, what I'm saying is reality
There is a place people live with joy
That the next man cannot come along and destroy
No one faces problems, no one says sorry
And war ain't nothing but a game on Atari
This message also applies to other nations
Like Africa for instance, where there's starvation
But if you come with me, you're sure to see
Ethiopians can eat in Red Lobster for free
And people that you saw before that were poor
Will never ever see the situation no more
Cause in this world everyone's a millionaire
<Is there WIC?>
Are you sick?
And what the hell is welfare?
Fashions are smashing for all to flaunt
And we can get anything that we want
So don't think you can't afford expensive design
Because fresh Gucci wear is only $5.99
So come ye all and attend this affair
As we journey to the promised land, and...
<Hmm... yeah... I'll take you there... oh!> (x3)
Since I'm the type of guy that laughs and jokes
This may sound funny, but seriously folks
It's a shame that people today must live
In a world that's operating oh so negative
But I found a place designed especially for you
Where peace and harmony is everyone's culture

I can't hold back any longer
I can't prolong my feelings for you any more
You know all of a sudden I feel this certain need to...
... Express myself to you
You see before I felt kind of funny to say these kind of things
I mean to be all honest, that is, but now... hmm...
Well let's just say I'm not ashamed
Now in my lifetime I've been all around the world
(Round and around and around)
From city to city, from state to state
And of course, from girl to girl
(Ooh-eauuuuuuu-ooh)
And I believe that I've played every game in the world
That one man could possibly play (don't play with me baby)
And of all those games, you're the only chip on the table
That's made me feel this way (aiy-yi-yahhhhah)
Now I realize that love takes time
And trust is somethin' that you have to earn
(Ooh, you gotta earn it baby) mmm
Well I'm prepared to give you all of me
But, I need the same in return (ooooooohoooo you know you got it)
These are some things that I've been meaning to say
And for my concealed feelings I've come to realize
That I'm to blame (arrrrrrrrre you sure)

For some type of commitment (don't you want it)
Nah, since I said _Ain't No Half-Steppin'_ (talk to me)

That men do, peace to every hood that I been through
I even got love for my homies in south central
But to the east my brother, cause that's where I stay at
Runnin' through the streets like a stray cat
Like that good times show it makes me go
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, hmmmmmmmmmm, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Up in the projects, it gets no iller
With true gue-rillas, and stone cold killers
It seems that every night, you get to hear the fireworks
As much as I hate, to see my people die or hurt
It's just a street mentality, a reality
Neighborhood warfare, that brings home casualties
And just because I moved out the residence
It don't mean that I can't represent
Chorus: kane + ""yeah! yeah!"" -> chanted in back throughout
So to my peeps in the pj's, throw your hands in the air
[Rick] ""for all of y'all..""
Let me know you're out there
To my peeps in the pj's, throw your hands in the air
[Rick] ""for all of y'all..""
Let me know you're out there
And to my peeps in the pj's, throw your hands in the air
[Rick] ""for all of y'all..""
And let me know you're out there
Ah to my peeps in the pj's, throw your hands in the air
[Rick] ""for all of y'all..""
And let me know you're out there
(Big daddy kane)
I'm runnin' mob deep around the way
It's me and the crew, we're tryin' to map out the day
Yo what's the haps on how we gettin' snaps?
Are we gonna shoot some cee-lo, or play a game of craps?
Matter fact, shane, ring the intercom
And see if you can get ten dollars from my moms
Tell her to throw it out the window if she got it to spare
Cause the elevator's broke, and I ain't checkin' for the stairs
And do me a solid, run to the store shorty
And pick me up some olde e, but not a 40
Just a two-two of brew will do, so I can knock it out fast
To make the coldness last
(Scoob)
And while you at man see where'd your friend go (word)
He shoulda been back a hour ago with the indo (yeah)
(Big daddy kane)
And meet us in the back park to get sparked
So I can be toasted by time it gets dark
Aiyyo jay, I see that bulge in the back of your jeans
Hope that's the God you now, know what I mean?
'Cause if somebody brings the noise, I'ma make it a silent movie
So take the safety off the toolie
'Cause I don't want no beef, nah baby
The only thing I wanna do is parrrrrrlay
Peace and harmony is what I relate to
But damn man, drama's just in the nature
(Big daddy kane)
I send this out to the homies in the hood
That stood by my side, to help a brother do good
Just like swv you was right here
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we in there
From all thugs that flex with all the muscle
Down to the brothers, that got a swift hustle
Like good golly miss three card molly, a neat trick
Where people get beat quick
Wanna see a sweet vic?
(Card shark)
Jackety jack, blackety black
You get nuttin back, and that's a fact
The sweetest game I ever seen
All you gotta do is find the red queen
Just point to it, can anybody point to it?
I play by the point of the finger of the hand
""The one in the middle! the one in the middle!""
That's black, you get no money back!
(Kane: aww man! see, I told you!)"
42,It's A Big Daddy Thing,1989,It's a Big Daddy Thing (1989),,Big Daddy Kane,"Ah yeah
We gon' pump this up one time
As we set it off a little like this, kick it!
Pump it up now (it's a Big Daddy thing)
As we send this out to New York City
Can't forget the posse down in Philly
Also in Detroit (it's a Big Daddy thing)
Chicago, Atlanta GA
Sendin this out to Miami (it's a Big Daddy thing)
Tampa, can't forget Virginia and North Carolina
L.A. and Oakland (it's a Big Daddy thing)
And the rest of the world as we go a little somethin' like this
(It's a Big Daddy thing)
Let it rain let it rain to be put it pain
With nothin' to gain under the wrath of Kane
Cause you can't maintain, I drained every brain
To leave a stain plain to remain in my lane
Or path or road, until the next one be sewed
That the B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y explode
Just like a bomb in Vietnam, so hit the alarm
Or be funky like a underarm
And allow, me to show how, the microphone should flow
Now, competition bow, to me like a Buddha
The teacher, the tutor
They come a dime a dozen but the Kane look cuter
And I ain't about that slouchin or crabbin
So save it -- cause that's one thing I ain't havin'
Because the purpose I serve is to please ya
Rhymes will ease ya, like Milk of Magnesia
So bust a pimp without a limp
And I crush any wimp that would try to attempt to umm
Get loose I put a boost and used to chill
The comp to Kane, I picked Beetlejuice
""Big Daddy thing"" (2X)
I'm just that ruthless, to leave ya toothless
'Cause you're useless, makin' up excuses excuses
So never touch tap tangle or tamper
A fearless fly foe'll get slapped with a Pamper
'Cause I can dig in your face like root canal
But I'ma chill, won't even dispute you now
Actin' wild just ain't my style
Cause only the live will be movin the crowd but see
Quiet as kept, not like a starter you
But I can roast an MC like a barbecue
In the Dead Zone, you shouldn't have left home
Steppin to the man, now get the head flown
I bring the terror, horror, there's no tomorrow
Child you shouldn't even bother
To press up, and get broken like a Lee nail
So let me school ya plus scoop your female
Just like a jiggalo but I'm much bigger though
I'm like a hitman, pullin the trigger slow
And smooth to the groove with lyrics that sooth
And improve with every move, that's why you've
Been enhanced by the mentally divine
So play football, and let's go the nine
Shorts I take none, 'cause I ain't the one
In eighty-nine there's damage bein done
And for you to diss me, will be very risky
'Cause I make this be, as strong as whiskey
To break and make my foes dispose in force
So y'all can see how me the Kane will just reign
Superior, 'cause I ain't even hearin ya
Save the yang, 'cause it's a Big Daddy thang
""Big Daddy thing"" (4X, then cut and scratched to end)
And this one here goes out to my man Mad Money Murph
Can't forget Big Sha, Big Therm
And also I got to say whassup to my man Horace
Got Nice and Smooth in the place to be
Mack Daddy Nick, know what I'm sayin'?
Can't forget my man Ant Live
And of course the one and only Prince Paul, peace!"

Mad Money Murph just bring me on and uh
Just bring me on, yo
This is a world premier and I'm here
A presentation beyond compare
So MC's step to the rear as I break through
Girls say ooh and then skip to my loo
That means dance as I get smooth with
Poetic perfection that you can groove with
Just like a passenger, hurry and fasten your seatbelt
'Cause I'm about to start broadcastin
The words of wisdom, so turn up the system
Loud and clear, I don't want no one to miss one
Word to be heard never blurred or slurred
The preferred is absurd, all the damage that's occurred
As I break MC's like a lumberjack
Ain't no comin' back, you can't get none of that
I'm not the type of MC to be merciful
So if your name ain't Jermaine take it personal
Cause like a vigilante I'm gonna kill off any
Sucker MC that tries to withstand me
With the mic in my hand I start flowin then
All competition flee and start goin' in
The other direction, run for protection

The verbal law for the Nation of Islam

Let me inject this, flow of electric currency
For all the party people preferrin me
And spectatin like a tourist, cause you never
Saw this style of rap kickin like Chuck Norris
But this ain't Kung-Fu, no I just brung you
A style, that phony MC's were too young to
Digest, when I manifest, you adolescent
So sit back, relax, be glad you had a lesson
And this one's for your listenin pleasure
Somethin' for all the bitin MC's to treasure
Just like a diary, for you to admire me
Before you're put in the Dead Poet's Society
Cool as a draft, droppin' math in a paragraph
I laugh as the wrath break in half, your whole staff
But many MC's were able to retreat
Runnin' like an athlete, but I got bad feet
So I don't chase ya, nor do I wait to face ya
Nah it ain't in my nature
I just rip shop, flip-top, and watch MC's get dropped
As I manifest in hip-hop
Rhymes I construct are tough like a Tonka truck
And just like lightnin they struck
Down on all the toy MC's that annoy
That's how I build and destroy
The poetic printer, rough rhyme inventor
With a groove so smooth you can't help but get into
So I'm advisin competition to flee
'Cause I can bake an MC like Chef Boyardee
Holdin' my own on the microphone
'Cause I break bones just like sticks and stones

God damn, it's hard bein the Kane!
Give it to me! Get up!
Come on! Uh!
Give it to me! Come on!

Put in a pause, because here's the holocaust
Above all laws, in effect and all yours

A replace, erase the waste without a trace
My vocabulary will just have you very
Dazed and amazed so I fear no adversary --
That means competition
They can't even touch this, even with ammunition
Break out the gauge and go into an outrage
And I'ma still blow up the stage
Cause this is a death threat, but don't let your sweat get
In the way of your vision don't be missin' when I get set
To go on a rampage, start a one man rage
Total destruction as I rip up the damn stage
And leave it in ruins from the damage that I'm doin'
To prepare the atmosphere, as I put you in
The mood for the Smooth Operator to start this flow
And so...
I crushed and crushed and stomped the comp that tried
To get fly and face the ace I put 'em in place
Proceed em, retreat em, defeat em, delete em, and feed em, and eat em
And all the rest of that good stuff, 'cause I don't need em

Got Fric and Frac in the house
Hey-hey-hey, you got Big Daddy Kane in the house
Juice Crew in the house
That's right

One, two, whatcha gonna do?
I say yes, yes y'all
To the beat, all
Party-having people guaranteed to be like having a ball
H-h-h-hey
We gonna do a little something like this I say...
I'm the rap promoter
I start to motor
Tour from New York to South Dakota
Drink ginger ale or root beer soda
Never get the girls with the underarm order
Put me on water, I'm a good floater
When I run for prez, you best be a voter
Once knew a girl by the name of Rhoda
I watch Star Wars just to see Yoda
Or R2-D2 driving down the BQ
When I buy franks, I make sure theyæ®e Hebrew
When I entertain, and love to treat you
Love to see a girl in a nice tight see-through
Take her to the crib, turn on the Beta
Watch a good flick by Arnold Schwartzenegger
Maybe Commando or the Terminator
Peace party people, ha ha see you later!
Big Daddy, huh huh, my man my mellow
Get on the mic cause you know you eat Jell-O
Kane:
Check it out, y'all
You don't stop
Keep on
Well it's the Kane in the flesh
Of course I'm fresh
Oh you thought that I was rotten?
Huh, I beg your pardon
To me getting paid and getting busy fall together
So a man of my ambiance... never!
Could I be weak, why I'm rather unique
I got style, flavor, grace, and plus a different technique
That I be using and not many can manage
So a brother like me, I do damage
Just by picking up the mic to go solo
I cold turn a party on out, and oh yo
I get physical, mystical, very artistical
Giving party people something funky to listen to
That's why the other MCæ¯ can't swing long
I stomp them out just like I was King Kong
Stepping on roaches, I get ferocious
Supercalifragalisticexpealidocious
I go on and on and on and
Until the bright Shirley Murdock morning
'Cause I'mma pimp, hear the primp, yes the emp-
Eror, bringing much terror in your era
I ready, willing and I'm able, so bust a move
Never use a barbershop I got my homeboy Smooth
Cooling out with the clippers right around the way
To keep my fresh Cameo cut every day
Like that y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like thata-the-that, it's like that y'all
'Cause I'm the prosecutor taking a stand
And, I'm cross-examining you my man
The judge and jury, releasing my fury
The verdict that I reach for you is rather blurry
You see, the name Kane is superior to many people
It means King Asiatic Nobodyæ¯ Equal
I hate to brag, but damn I'm good
And if mics were a gun, Iæ be Clint Eastwood
And if rap was a game, Iæ be MVP
Most Valuable Poet on the M-I-C
Or if rap was a school, Iæ be the principal
Aw fuck it, the Kane is invincible
To be specific, I may die one day
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
It's a certain special skill that takes much practice
I got it good, apparently you lack this
So in turn, sit back and learn
Listen close, this is for your own concern
Let me show you exactly how it's properly done
Lights, camera, action!
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo afro, Virgo, domino, I go Rambo
Gigolo, Romeo, Friday night spend money on a ho-

Give it to me
Get on the dancefloor
Start to clap your hands for
The smooth operator, what more can your ask for
The musical maestro
That's usin' the mic so
I can spark up the entire place like nitro-
Glycerine because the crowd is sizzlin
Bobbin they heads to what's said and still listenin
I specialize in fun
And I must know what's happenin' 'cause you're dancin like re-run
So behold the natural born soul, a rhythm
To get 'em and hit 'em as I party with em
My job is to make you all feel this
But I'm not don cornelius
I'm just a new black cesar here to please ya, ease ya
Movin and groovin, provin, soothin at your leisure
I don't sing or yell
But my rhymes reach out and touch more people than Ma Bell
The brain of the Kane's so intelligent
You think dancin is irrelevant
And start stompin like a elephant
But that's not necessary, just let the beat carry
You into somethin' funkadelic
That might best describe
The musical vibe you feel when I arrive
From the moment I walk through the door
I gotta keep 'em on the floor
Get up and dance and move your body across the floor
Go on and do your thing until you're feelin' sore
(I can't dance no more)
Get on up and dance
(Let's dance)
Get on up and dance
(Give it here)
Get on up and dance
(Funky)
Look
You came in the disco
Thinkin' it would be just low
But I'ma make sure you enjoy this show
You won't have a chance to sit down
(Get down)
And listen to rhymes that go the mile like a marathon
A voice that's choice, as strong as sarah vaugh
Swift delivery flowin like a river be
Flowin, but only ladies know my tongue is that slippery
I grab the mic and then we'll see
Who can d-a-n-c-e
Makin' the crowd roar for more of what they saw
And I'm sure that I can keep 'em on the floor
Oh
Feel like I'm down here by myself sometimes
I'm ready to break this groove down
You're ready
So I'ma let the music just stop
And we gon' get into our own thing for a minute here
You're ready
Break it down
Keep on dancin
(Keep on dancin)
(Dance)
Bring in paramedics to relieve the
Trace of this bad case of dance fever
'Cause I can feel the disco heat gettin' to me
While the sweat got my silk drawers stickin to me
But I can't stop, I gotta party
Like a gun on the dancefloor and catch a body
I might move real smooth
Then again dance real silly
Just like a hillbilly
As I make sure the beat is kept
So all the party people stay in step
Become a slave to the rhythm
Grab someone of the opposite sex and dance with em
Put your partner on the floor and face em
That shows a positive sign of unification
And if all party goers could make this move
We'd be one nation under a groove
So let's try this, stop the violence
That can only result in peace from what I sense
To be straight to the point
A little love and harmony - mh (it's the joint)
So build a nation, pump the bass and
The treble beyond the level of imagination
So the Big Daddy Kane can endure
And the name of this tune is Keep Em on the Floor

I hope you hear me, here comes the brooklyn theory
At your service, got you shook and nervous
Now, what you gonna do when black caesar comes to surface
My purpose is making sure you bless me right
So I can climb aboard that money train with wesley snipes
Daddy love how I get down ain't no secret
And every night, my backyard is just like the freaknik
What you mean from hot sexy mamas to cool prima donna's
Easy pickings on the chickens got them up in the camp
It's that old tramp, the one who keep your pum pum's damp
I see the honeys in the frontier looking for what you want dear
Yes, there's a lot of game run here.
All the playas in the game
Another year
And ain't a damn thing changed
We get together and we do our thing
On stage at arenas or a show in the park
I shine so bright my black ass glow in the dark

Here comes the reign of kane about to get in your spot
Your tough talk's monotonous, beware as I be droppin' this
Lyrical apocalypse all through your metropolis
Sexual chocolate the velvet smooth voice
That be the people's choice and get the girls moist
No time for timid fear, cause there ain't no limits here
Got the world in my hands you ain't even found the hemisphere
It's real scary how rap skills vary bringin' dollar bills near me
Making dough rise like pillsbury
Now get this it's time we start stepping to our business
I come as living proof so bear witness
Not to contradict myself but see really
I'm untouchable but making sure you people feel me
I talk that talk from the gutter my game don't stutter
I can tell you why white milk be making yellow butter
Some cats, they be shifty, some cats they be iffy
So I move swiftly, play the field like ken griffey
Because, I be the all mighty, relax like tai chi
Making it irie
I flow over tracks when the beats are mean
Girls I go downtown when the streets are clean
Make it happen all my peoples
More chips than doritos I know we all trying to see those
So I return to give you more again
Because my name dates back until the game's origin
See what the fact is, is you need practice
With girls I just mack this, stick 'em in just like cactus
Watch me now, baby it's all right
I got bunions on my game from it being too tight"
49,Last Night Episode,1998,Veteranz' Day (1998),,Big Daddy Kane,"* Phone is dialed, rings, and is picked up *
(Kane has a conversation with himself)
Aiyyo what happened last night, did you forget?
You said that you was pushin through my way with some Moet"
50,Let Yourself Go,1994,Daddy's Home (1994),,Big Daddy Kane,"Somebody tell me who's that, what's that
It's the man with the silk drawers stuck up his buttcrack
Don't even front and try to ask who is this
Cause my name rings more bells than a Jehovah Witness
Stronger than Listerine, moppin up rappers like Mr. Clean
Oh Lord, the Kane just hit the scene
Booyaka bo buck, rappers have no luck
'Cause when I come through, I'm catchin wreck, like a tow truck
Cause ain't no way in the world the Kane could ever, fade
I'm stayin on top of this thing, in order for me to get, paid
And anyone comin' to me for a battle is gettin', slayed
Whenever it comes to the lyrics I'm rappin' I got it, made
So back up off me, cause yo' rap
Have no hap' so slow dat and act like you know dat
Cause you can dream about bein this up to par
But not even Johnny Mathis can tell you what your chances are
Competition I'll drill em, and definitely outskill em
To make the long story short, I kill em
'Cause I face 'em like Jason, bizarre
And when I come through, it's like tchk tchk ah"
51,Long Live The Kane,1988,Long Live the Kane (1988),,Big Daddy Kane,"Party people in the place
Embrace the bass as I commence to pick up the pace
And make you motivate, and accelerate
Cause like Tony the Tiger, I'm greeeat!
Always seem to come off, hard for you somehow
I mean me being wack, oh come come now
That's quite ridiculous, so just admit you was
Thrilled, it's on your face, and it's conspicuous
Not that you're on this, but my performance
Is rather exquisite, so hard is it
Or supremacy, that's the perfect definition
But rappers keep wishing to be in my position
Know good and damn well they ain't no competition
Huh, I gotta give it to you kid, that's ambition
For you to perpetrate the role of me, the Big Daddy
The Big Father, naah, don't even bother
Cause that would mean you would have to teach
Each and every one idiotic son
Trying to make it, you can't fake it
The rhymes I recite are fully dressed and yours are butt naked
Your speech is weak, while my mine stands strong
So, all hail the man that's here to live long
<Break>
You know you heard this voice before somewhere
And when I said that I'm the Kane, you said ""oh yeah!""
That brother that used to rhyme on stage with Biz
Oh he's def,"" you know what time it is
But this time I'm not assisted on the microphone
More like Patti Labelle, on my own
Just single-handed, the mic I commanded
Phony MC's don't understand it, and it
Is the real thing like the taste of Coke
So never sleep on me, better stay awoke
Like a gambler in Vegas, I go for broke
To make a long story short, yo I ain't no joke
I take time and care in whatever I'm doing
And when I rock a party, I make sure that you en-
Joy what you're hearing as I entertain
So hip hip hoolay, long live the Kane
I got the freedom of speech to use it anyway that I choose it
So all hail to the music
On exhibit, get with it, now here's my ring
The original supreme being Black man
Point blank, the cream to rise supreme
As those go below like a submarine
Reaching and teaching a lesson that I'm giving
Addressing and impressing the crowd, so how we living?
Fine in mind, to decline is out of line
So pardon this brother as I give you mine
To say I'm not, don't even diss yourself
Cause at times, I have to jump back and kiss myself
Long live the K, the A, the N, the E
I say the end will be
A big movement, by the time I'm through
And that's coming from a Black man's point of view
Now pardon me for just changing the issue
But all you sucker MC's, it's a must that I diss you
The way y'all be fronting has made me disgusted
Now I'mma set you straight, so so yo yo, bust it
Rappers try and hang and just swear that they can party
But the style that I'm using is just like karate
So if we ever battle you're bound to be through
Because I got a black belt in Rap Can Do
No I'm not Chinese, it's just rhymes like these
That destroy an MC with black belt degrees
You're rocking a party, trying so hard to get loose
Kid sound awiiite, but I can't taste the juice
Therefore, the job is left to me
So I get the party kicking just like Bruce Lee
But I won't stop there, I still rock a little harder
While the toy MC's step and say, Sayonara!
Long Live the Kane! (x2)
Break it down!"

53,Lyrical Gymnastics,1994,Daddy's Home (1994),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Kane *singing*)
Do you know, what you're goin' through?
Do you like this style of rap that I'm showin you?
The way I flow for you... do you know?
(Kane *rapping*)
Yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, check the rhyme to the song
Uh, aw yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, and check the rhyme to the song
One double nine to the four, gotta keep 'em on the floor
And put some real lyrics back in the hardcore
What I'm used to hearin, I can't believe it's gone
But now just like a grill inside Burger King, the beef is on
When I come, rappers begin to speak in degrees
I even make Sisters With Voices _Weak in the Knees_
So run for your lives, Kane with the pen
Is like Freddy with the glove full of knives
Who wanna test these skills, come see how it feels
I pull you one verse, if that don't kill I got refills
You can't do me none, kid you gets nothin'
If my rhymes was in braille, you still couldn't touch em
Man, I'm a bad cat, my style of rap is mad fat
And you know, sometimes it's so sad that
Rappers today be comin' as the gangster rhyme type
And be so soft, they wouldn't even kill time right
Here's the news, you lettin the word hardcore be misused
You ain't never paid dues
Be for real, you ain't tough yet
The razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin' you a ruffneck
Your whole image is a dammmmmmmmn sham
I'm glad in this business I didn't forget who I am
I always remain the Kane inside a battle
*Singing* Never to walk in anyone's shadow
I do my own thing, I do a thing of my own
And with my competition I let it be known
That battles I don't lose none, boy you get bruised son
Six million ways to die -- choose one!
My rap style is like a poisonous vemon
We might as well be havin' sex, the way that I put it in em
And do I crush MC's - are you kiddin me?
If rappers were grapes, I'd have a whole wine distillery
So, I bring it to your face, with the bass, then I BLOW
A rapper off the map, with the rap, when I FLOW
Then hit you with the skill that is ill, and I KNOW
That all of this is good to go, cause yo
That's the way the flavor always come
The rhymes they flow accordin to the drum
The Brooklyn style caue that is where I'm from
You want the funk so let me give you some
I flip on the flow on the track, just like that
Amazin the people the style of the rapppin, is quite fat
I'm lickin' the lyrics and shootin the gat, on the mic black
And this is for all of the rappers that like, and they bite that
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone
Settin the tone that make the girls relax and moan
Cause all the ladies I'm givin' 'em lots of love
Hittin more skins than a boxing glove, good God
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some
From tall to short to thick, even the slimmie ones
Watch out Goldie! Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E
And none of you players can control me
You get the chance to see a true mack man
With skills to pay the bills, to make more stacks than
Taller than anybody else's stacks it seem
Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine
The unforgettable, rhymes are too poetical
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical
And I hope the record consumers don't believe the magazine rumors
Cause Kane is makin' a comeback, like Puma's!
I get rough G, and set it on your whole damn company
And Bogart, like my name was Humphrey
When I get through, there'll be no more of them
As many rappers I burnt, I should open a crematorium
I make mad MC's give me my P's
If you try to disrespect, kid you can get these
N-U-T's, like the U-N-V's
I leave you down on your knees, down on your knee-heeees!
Razor sharp, many ways of art
Source rings the chart, people praise the God
For kickin the flows so fantasitic and this one here
We're callin it Lyrical Gymnastics
Uh, so baby baby c'mon
Aw yeah baby c'mon, and check the rhymes to the song
Uh, ah baby baby c'mon
Suki suki c'mon, and I'm gone!"

Who is the man with the master plan?
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
Then it goes a little something like this...>
Yes, here we go, on with the show
As the rhythm of this starts to flow
No matter the tempo, fast or slow
Get up and dance cause the Kane said so
This is the dance floor groove of the album
Presented to you all live from Calvin
Whoops! I meant to say Mister Cee
The disc jockey down with me, the
Microphone lord, my wisdom is a sword
Try to get with us, and get floored
Some DJ's try to front, but yo don't let them fool you
Cause wine is fine, but Calvin is cooler
Jump up and down, and eh, and all around and
Check out the way that my DJ is sounding
On the turntables to keep the crowd stable
Killing the cuts putting bodies on a record label
And just for the symphony

Taking a stand like a band
Mister Cee got a master plan
Hit it!

55,Mortal Combat,1989,It's a Big Daddy Thing (1989),,Big Daddy Kane,"The kiss of death on a rap pick
Then you get a slap quick, so guard it with Chapstick
In other words, protect and hold your own
It only takes one punch to get the head flown
Fists of fury, suckers get buried
Cause the Kane got more spice than curry
I am the flavor down on paper
And nothing could save ya, from catchin the vapors
Rhymes that'll sting your face like a quick jab
And I'm rubbin 'em in just like Vicks say I'm
Captivatin, dominatin, innovatin, illustratin, fascinatin
Motivatin, elevatin, terminatin, mutilatin
Rhymes they're worth their weight in
Gold, bold, never sold to a bidder
That claim to glitter, you're so bitter like kitty litter
As for damage, don't tell me what another do
'Cause I quote that I'm R-A-W
So make room, cause fighters are doomed
Try to consume, and make your own tune
A grave from a casket, a tisket a tasket
You're rhymes out of basket, boy you get your ass kicked
For frontin like you hittin hard
When your arms are too short, to box with God
So don't even touch 'cause I come with too much
Address and bless any mic that I clutch
And for a rapper to challenge my freestyle
He must be senile, and that's why meanwhile
Back at the ranch...
There goes the asiatic chosen one that's expandin with a new branch
So many slept on the nonchalant act
Now wake up sucker this is mortal combat
I seize and freeze MC's with these degrees
Put me to my knees, or at ease, chillllld please
I break it down, to bring on the next act
Rappers are so full of shit, they need Ex-Lax
So stop griffin, your mind is driftin
Prepare yourself 'cause I get swift and
Captivate the crowd but you can't understand
At times I gotta say to myself, ""God damn!""
As I get hot, and still be gettin' warmer
And I don't have beef with no other performer
Keep to myself never bother another
But if a rapper tries to diss I crush the motherfucker!
Frontin MC's that be tryin' to riff
Need to save it, and don't even play with
Me when I react like a volcano eruptin
I step to you and say, ""Now what's up?"" then
Every word'll be just like surgery
Cuttin' you open so rush to emergency
Or even bow to your knees and below
Or get played like a game of Nintendo
J-O-K-E-S ain't my style
I ain't a child that's why I don't smile
I combine a line designed to find behind the mind
So devine the other rappers resign
As I go on, from night to morn
Beginning to end, from Knowledge to Born
Whenever rappers are lookin' for static
Looks like a job for King Asiatic
N-E, send me, competitors
Then again, it might just be better to
Just slow down you don't wanna throwdown
I get busy, get you dizzy like a merry-go-round
Feel the wrath of a Big Daddy raw rhyme
And competition, prepare for wartime
Be alert for where I drop the bomb at
As I destroy you with mortal combat
I roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol
Of folders molders towin black gold
So let it be said, let it be read
'Cause I lead ahead, of others who rhymes are old as Pro-Keds
Tryin' to diss the Big Daddy repetoire
Moi??
You steady screamin out a antique segment wrote
As I just play 'em like a pregant roach and STOMP EM
For tryin' the forbidden
Your rhymes ain't hittin, boy you won't be gettin'
None of, or in front of, cause every one of
My adversaries, lack, you little son of
O-bit-uary column, and read your name
If you ever try to step to the Big Daddy Kane
So any claimin or aimin to be champion
Against me? Psssh, can't be one
I rank supreme and it's a rapper's dream
To scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem
Cause there's only room for one teacher
Wise words from a wise man'll reach ya
I teach freedom, justice, and equality
Peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me
Plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours
Slaves, from mental death in power
That's the reason before I drop this bomb
I say peace to the Nation of Islam"
56,Mr. Pitiful,1990,Taste of Chocolate (1990),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Big Daddy Kane)
Mmm... mmm, yeah
Oh I like this
I wanna tell this story
A little story about umm...
... A brother who you would think has everything goin' for himself
But apparently for some reason he just ain't happenin'
I call this brother Mr. Pitiful
I wanna tell you somethin' about him, check it out
The story begins in 1984
When I met the BizMarkie out in front of the store
He used to tell me all the time, ""Yo your lyrics is hype
We got to get together and make a record of some type""
I said, ""Man, the hype behind Run-D.M.C. and Cool J
What the fuck makes you think they're gonna give us a play?""
We did a few shows together, freestylin on stage
Manhattan and Long Island, for Mike and Dave
After that, I was convinced we can do it
Until my man Biz jetted and came out with ""Make the Music..""
From right there, I said, ""Man, this shit is real
Look at Biz in the new leather and a pair of spot bills""
I got to give it to you Dukes, I was wrong
Well you out there now, so put my black ass on
And sure enough, huh, in about a year's time
I was R-A-W, goin' for mine
Droppin' jams that slammed on every radio program
And bam, GOD DAMN, look where I am
The first album, _Long Live the Kane_, it sold
About umm... AWW FUKKIT it went gold
The money was comin' in, yes I had done 'em in
It wasn't quite hard for me to find a woman then
'Cause I was in demand for lots of fans
A sexy chocolate guy in the public eye
I bought myself a condo out in Queens
A plush white Volvo and drove off the scene
But I remained the same since I moved out
For instance - drinkin' Olde E and Guinness Stout
And also, hangin' out with the troops
Most of all, takin' care of Ma Dukes
Then all of a sudden things started to change
And many old friends started actin' strange
Behind my back, sayin' I'm soft and a sucker
Some even said, ""Yo let's rob the motherfucker""
And family members askin for my papers
But Biz set them straight, by makin' ""The Vapors""
Girls cryin pregnant, to get some of my green
I'm like, ""What the fuck is this? Billie Jean?""
People harassin me, steadily askin me
Dis or dat, some even had the audacity
To say that I only liked light-skinned women
Tchk, huh, are you kiddin?
'Cause I love everyone
And I never act prejudiced to none
But for some reason people make my lifestyle so critical
That's why they call me Mr. Pitiful
A few people know what I'm sayin'
Hmm, to the Little Daddy Shane, you know what I mean
And to my man Cool V, you know what I mean
To T.J. Swan, you know what I mean
And to Scoob and Scrap, you know what I mean
To Rob Base and E.Z. Rock, you know what I mean
The Magnum Force, you know what I mean
And to the playboys, you know what I mean
To Shemp Shawn, you know what I mean
And the F.M.C., you know what I mean
Can't forget Miv, you know what I mean
Godfather D, you know what I mean
My man Doug E. Fresh, you know what I mean
And the fifty dollar crew from Canada know what I mean
But most of all I can't forget my man Biz-Mar-KIE
And may I send this to A.J. Quest, Rest In Peace ??"
57,Niggaz Never Learn,1993,Looks Like a Job For... (1993),,Big Daddy Kane,"Things been said, plenty rumors been spread
Many many many new jacks got it in they head
That they can raise up on this and put the Kane in fright
Heheh... yeah right!
Listen, you're just as soft as baby powder
Don't let your mouth get you in somethin'
Your rhymes can't get you out of
Some good advice is don't even come out my way
You better press up on Chucky if you're lookin' for Child's Play
'Cause I'm a grown ass man in total command
One of the best to ever be and
No other can ever take a stand
When I kick a verse the scene becomes so scary
That niggaz get quiet like a library
I pick up the mic like a hunter in hot pursuit
Oh you want some of this? Then put that mic on mute
Because you'll be in more danger than Penelope Pitstop
Point blank, you get your shit dropped
I got a death blow whenever I throw
With double impact to take out the whole row
Huh, I start swingin' again and again
You'll hear so many ""ooh ahhs"" you'll think it was Boyz II Men
I break down, shake down, proceed down, beat down
Back down, smack down, rip down, get down
Showdown, throwdown, rundown, come down! *DJ rewinds*
Here's a little message for your own concern
You try to press up on this and get burned
A battle with a non-believe is what I yearn

Yo, they're hard to figure out, gee
They need a sincere leader

You know, I've heard it said
You gotta use what you got to get what you want
But I think they're usin' a little bit too much when they flaunt
You know
[Name], you know, ehm
I don't understand the way these girls is rolling today, man
How about you, man?
{Male voice:}
Yo, let me tell you somethin', gee
If they ain't lying they tryin' to do some other - wildness
{Big Daddy Kane:}
I know, I know

And can't even cook toast, right?
What I'm tryin' to tell you, man, is...
They just ain't no damn good
No damn good
Check it out
Now there's this girl named Monique
The type of female that you consider a freak
A big-time player playin' like a drum beat
You think her address is 21 Hump Street
She step out every night to swing
With her Lee press-on's and a nefertiti ring
Bamboo earrings all big and lookin' silly
With extensions hangin' down like Milli Vanilli
And every Wednesday night at the Apollo
First kid she saw with jewerly she'd follow
And Monique would be ready to sleep
With the first kid in a Benz or a Cherokee Jeep
Strung out and givin' up the nappy dug out
You're on the critical list, about to pull the plug out
So here, nympho, here's some good info
Stop takin' 'em putts and close your legs, toots
'Cause I remember you was one of a kind and a fine - hm
I once was infatuated by the things that you do
But now you're doodoo
It's all about respectin yourself
In order to gain respect from anyone else
Treat yourself like a real woman should
Cause bitch, you ain't no damn good

There's a lotta guys out there that ain't no damn good either

Yeah, aight
But check this here out
Well now, here's another story
About this kid by the name of Corey
A hustler with game tryin' to make a name
That was his aim, but his lifestyle was lame
'Cause he would front like it wasn't even funny
About his girl, his car, and his money
Pullin out a knot every place
But every single bill had Washington's face
And he went beyond exaggeration
To lie about his means of transportation
Because he said he had a Benz car
Come to find out, it was his friend's car
Talk about simple chronic halitosis
Damn, his breath was ferocious
He had an odor that just won't quit
Smelled like he washed in Oil Of Oh shit
Tellin' girls he's daddy long-strokin
(Shit, you must be jokin)
'Cause he ain't got no bitches
And couldn't hurt a virgin if her pussy had stitches
See, Corey, there's a lot you're missin'
Seems to me, you ain't got a pot to piss in
So let's get one thing understood
Muthafucka, you ain't no damn good

The moral of the story is
The majority of the population of males and females today
Are just no damn good"

Some like it hard and some like it soft,
Yo, bust the groove as I set it off."

Well, here we are,
United just for you.
Our flat-top cuts are new
Because we're on the move.
Verse 1 (Big Daddy Kane):
Na-na-na now girls step up, the quick ones kept up.
The slow ones need to pep up to keep Big Daddy's rep up,
'Cause I don't let up or get up or even set up.
On a a speak freak, I know how to make you shut up.
Gasp your breath as you huff and puff.
The Big Daddy got more than enough good stuff,
'Cause I'm just like secret when it comes to trimin'.
Strong enough for a man but made for women,
So come one, come all, I'm not about bein' picky.
It only takes a hickey to make you want a quickie
>From the cameo haircut man that's dark and lovely,
Smooth and suave, that's why girls dream of me,
And not to flaunt, I love a flirt with a skirt
And after a concert, a little neeeaaah don't hurt,
Just to hear the girls screamin' out wild, G.
You're not a Jungle Brother, but that's some Jimbrowski.
I'm like a pimp, see, and iff you tempt me,
I can fill up any girls that's empty,
Give you somethin' that's mighy and strong,
But ladies, don't get me wrong
Because you say that I love 'em and leave 'em, but no, I please ya
And then catch amnesia,
But the party people can't be denied,
So I remember those who's on my side.
Mister Cee cuts and scratches ""Scoob Lover, my brother.""
Verse 2 (Scoob Lover):
The mic goes around like a 40 ounce.
Now, I'm-a take a sip, now it's time to bounce.
I won't get tipsy, I don't drink and talk
And, no, I'm not a hoddlum by the way I walk,
'Cause I'm one hype, one brown-skinned brother.
For those who don't know me, I'm (who?) Scoob Lover,
A jolly good fellow, flowin' with the mellow.
For all the choice cuties, I'd love to say ""Hello"",
So take away the 3, let's stick to 1, 2.
Me and you, now here's a clue what we could do.
It begins with an S and ends with an X.
Hmmm, not the number 6, so guess what's next,
So girls, don't barge, don't blink, be still
'Cause it's about time for Scoob to get ill.
Remeber you dissed, now you wanna kiss,
Write me fan letters, sayin' that you miss.
There's only one rap dance, the cool romancer.
If I had a million dollars, I'd try to cure cancer,
But I'm only here to get illey, ha.
Now, I'm drug free and I don't smoke Phillies,
So come here, shorty, go buy me a 40.
And make sure it's cold so the crew can get naughty.
Mister Cee cuts and scratches ""Scrap Lover, my other.""
Verse 3 (Scrap Lover):
You get jacked if you ever try to nap
On a a rap from Scrap because you know there's no haps.
Now, right from where I left off, to all those who stepped off,
You know you had it comin', the blame is what you slept off.
?Destruction played a part on roll, here's so to say.?
You can't mislead me. Why? 'Cause I know the way.
Always gave headahces, never known for heartaches.
Time and effort, huh, that's what a star takes.
Let me give you a true piece of mind
'Cause this rare species is so hard to find.
I'm custom-made for all the ladies with guts,
A tall box of hair or rather cameo cuts.
Draggin' tattoes is what the girls found,
Two on m chest, one draggin' on the ground.
To all the young ladies that's clean and legit,
As long as I got a face, you got a place o sit.
No tokens for heart-broken turnstiles,
No remarks or regrets, but I'll burn while
Those that's destined to question for a new thing.
Join us in harmony together as we sing.
For all the ladies determined that once was
So jealous, stop searchin' now 'cause...
(Mister Cee cuts and scratches)
Outro (Big Daddy Kane)
You don't stop, you don't stop.
You keep on to the break of dawn."
61,"Ooh, Aah, Nah-Nah-Nah",1991,Prince of Darkness (1991),,Big Daddy Kane,"Enquiring minds wanna know, did the champ retire
So here I am, boomin like an amplifier
I clear my throat, then I float like a boat
Note for note, what I wrote you can't quote or even tote
Raps are too heavy, sharp like a machete
Pass the microphone, cause Kane is all ready
Grippin to play the part to prove that I'm in command
The Biggest Daddy of 'em all, and oh, Kane stands for
King Asiatic, Nobody's Equal
Or Non-Equivalent, or Natural Ebony
Or Now Effective, or Never Ever
Pick your definition and put it together
Cause it still comes out tastin like chocolate
With the finesse MC's never got with
Cause none of them want me to touch the mic first
They know that it only takes Kane one verse
So here's the microphone, show me what you can do
And uh *yawning* wake me up when you're through
Just so I can go and flow and throw a blow
To show a pro and let 'em all know
That any MC tryin' to be this lyrical
Should go ask Smokey Robinson for a Miracle
I wouldn't let a rapper go one round
I'm knockin' them down, just like Jim Brown
So Mister Cee, let the music play
And here's what I want y'all to say
Ooh! (c'mon) Ah! (c'mon)
Nah-Nah-Nah, Nana (c'mon like you should)
Ooh! (c'mon) Ah! (c'mon)
Nah-Nah-Nah, Nana (uh!)
Ooh! (ooh) Ah! (ah)
Nah-Nah-Nah, Nana (sing that song!)
Ooh! (c'mon) Ah! (c'mon)
Nah-Nah-Nah, Nana
Here's a rap avalanche, MC's travel and
Run run for shelter, 'cause they don't have a chance
Any MC caught talkin' out of turn
I straighten 'em out just like a perm
Now let's take a second, just to recollect it
Give a little shout to the rappers that's out
Like all the East coast, MC's of today
From Run-D.M.C. on down to Kid'n'Play
The ladies like Salt-N-Pepa to Latifah
Who showed the power of a woman and me a believer
Now backtrack with the musical jewel
And say peace to the old school
And all praises due to the L.A. crew
You put your state on the map and kept bringin' rap through
I can't forget the brothers that's down in Miami
You're still 2 Live if you never get a Grammy
Cause personally I feel who really needs that stuff
If you ask me, it's just a bunch of makeup
There's a lot of caucasian kids that don't even know me
Cause every Billy and Joey is another David Bowie
I guess I used the wrong tools in my rhymes
* ""Superfreak"" * 'Cause when I nailed my clock, it didn't say Hammer Time
That's not a diss to my Oaktown friend
Just tellin' you how it is in the musical biz
'Cause I make sure that every rapper in the industry
Becomes a friend of me
And Mister Cee, let the music play
And here's what I want y'all to say
Ooh! (ooh) Ah! (ah)
Nah-Nah-Nah, Nana (nanana)
Ooh! (c'mon) Ah! (c'mon)
Nah-Nah-Nah, Nana (c'mon won'tcha c'mon)
Ooh! (oh) Ah! (uh)
Nah-Nah-Nah, Nana (sing that song!)
Ooh! Ah!
Nah-Nah-Nah, Nana"

Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't eeeeeee-zy) 6x
One-two-three-four, to five-six-seven
Eight, nine-ten, then ya got eleven
Twelve, thirteen, start your age;
Fourteen-fifteen-sixteen, the pubic stage
Like an apple, like a cherry, like a peach, like a plum
Better get off the virgin before I cuuuuum!
Pick up my pants and thump and thump
I think I'll call up Tootie, she'll give me some
Watch out, watch out I'm drippin' live scum
I say damn, I love the way I make my posse roll-a
'Specially if the hoochie's on birht control-a
Lift her up just like a pick up truck
Then I sat her down and we started to fuck
Made whoopie, made whoopie, made whoopie, YO-O-O-O-O!
I hope this time I don't make a cookie
Brothers everywhere be callin' me a rookie
Two from the Greg Nice from the o-o-old schoooooool
But bullshit, I ain't no fool, 'cause
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, they go:
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't eeeeeee-zy) 6x
Well, I say... Extra! Extra!
Here is a bachelor comin' straight at ya
I see trim and bag it, take it home and rag it
The Big Daddy law is anti-faggot
That means no homosexuality;
What's in my pants'll make you see reality
And if you wanna see a smooth black Casanova -- BEND OVAH!
'Cause I don't half-step when it comes to broads
The K-A-N-E'll go the whole nine yards
There's no time for coversation my dear
[MOAN!] is all I wanna hear
So let's make a move, as I get smooth
'Cause the purpose I serve is to soothe
I'm tall, dark and handsome and all that junk
Even white girls be sayin' ""Ooh, Kane's a hunk!""
Even Puerto Rican girls be callin' me papi
Some try to copy, but they look sloppy
So imitators who wanna step to a
Brother like me, lick my manure!
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, they go:
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't eeeeeee-zy) 6x
I'm just goin' and I'm flowin' like a gigolo
And when I used to be with Scott, I was a Super-Hoe
But now I'm coolin' with Kane and Greg N-I-C-E
And if the girlies want my tip they gotta pay a fee
I love bonin', and all my friends they will agree
That when it comes to pimpin' hoes... it ain't easy
First name: Smooth. Last name: B
WHen I'm bonin' a girl, I make her feel heavenly
I like to make 'em wait, and then make 'em beg
And when I take off my clothes, the I form a third leg
They rub it with oils and suck it with ice
Now I'm sweating... my mind is in paradise...
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, they go:
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't eeeeeee-zy) 6x
Tip-tip-toein', Scoob Lover's out hoein'
Braggin' to the fellas how my flattop was growin'
Buyin' drinks for the ladies, money I was blowin'
Right in front of me... mmm... not even knowin'
A brown-skinned cutie; big, plump booty
Nametag earrings readin' off ""Tootie""
Bullseye, bing, the girl of my dreams;
From my eyesight that was what it seemed
I said, uh, ""Come a little bit closer""
To Scoob that night, choice guy, she said ""Hi
Hi... hi, I've really been wantin' to meet you
I just got paid and I'll be very glad to treat you
How 'bout dinner, a Salisbury steak?""
I said, ""Sorry Honey-Dip, but I already ate""
So I nudged the other girlies off my shoulder
Went for Tootie 'cause the girl was much older
East to the Benz, I slowly walked;
Clearing out my throat so I cold start my smooth talk
Sex in my mind, I was sure of it...
I wanted to tax that ass like the government!
Anything goes when it comes to hoes, they go:
Pimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't eeeeeee-zy) 6x

Bitch better have my money"
63,Prelude,1993,Looks Like a Job For... (1993),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Big Daddy Kane)
Huh, huh, huh
Mister Cee, are you wit me, uh
Mister Cee, are you wit me, DIG IT
Gangster or prankster, define yourself, huh
And put that rough talk on the shelf
You talk all that robbery shit, but it's lame
You wouldn't steal first base at a baseball game
Never sold drugs, you never was a thug
But you're talking ying-yang like as if you're in a gang
I mean for goodness sake
The only beef you ever had was a sirloin steak
You wanna question me and all the words I say
Well, you can bring the noise any fuckin' day
I rock a rugged-a-ruff rhyme to besiege ya
And if I see you at a party, put up your dickbeaters
By time I get through wreckin your jaw
You be callin Patti LaBelle and Barry White hardcore
Why should I give up for gangster contrast
When I can rap about gettin' some ass
To prove that I'm a gangster only brings me trouble
But the proof that I'm a lover * sound of a zipper *
It's that easy but still you insist (yeah)
That I do this (what?)"
64,Prince Of Darkness,1991,Prince of Darkness (1991),,Big Daddy Kane,"Give it here... uh
Mic testing one two
Right about now I wanna have a little fun with this
And just talk a little bit of junk ya know
Be-because it's OK, ya know, it's OK to brag and boast
From time to time, ain't nothin' wrong with that
So I'm gonna have a little fun with it
Check the Prince of Darkness y'all, here we go
(Verse One)
Four times for your mind the poetically inclined
Genuine and divine can still climb
When you thought that I wouldn't go the length
But I cup a cameo and I still got strength
So make room 'cause I'm sweepin up like a broom
'Cause I'm the straight up wholly original yeah that's right mmm hmm
To be blunt and lay my cards on the table
You'll be Gone With the Wind for messin with Dark Gable
In comes the era of the chocolate types
Like your Bobby Brown, Aaron Hall and Wesley Snipes
Including myself in the cipher the Big Daddy Kane is a part of it
AKA, your prince of darkness
(Verse Two)
When it comes to the girls they know the program
'Cause when I get through it's pure Silence of the Lambs
So ladies grab a hand and join the caravan
That's bein ran by the hoochie cooche man
Then don't miss a breath of my kiss of death
An A plus in lust while your boyfriend is a F
I come tellin' you Tales From the Darkside
And separate the men from their women like Apartheid
You say am I a, vam-pire
That will react to ya just like Blackula
But when I say Prince of Darkness I don't mean a blood sucker
I'm talkin' about a black lover
So mysterious and serious the women are curious
So when I walk inside of a place it's like ""Ooh, there he is!""
But slow down, there's enough of me to go 'round
Huh, I'm givin' girls more Temptations than Motown
And tonight's the night for me to get right
And give girls the feeling of love at first bite
So here's a lesson of what the don art is
Taught by the big you know, Prince of Darkness
(Verse Three)
Stop, hold up, pause, quit
Change the groove and funk it up a little bit
Now back to the subject of how the
Kane became the bigger modern day mama wild deep
Now the question is do I really carry it
Huh, well baby I swing low like sweet chariot
Still a few of them thought that I was lame
And then the big brown shah came!
So let me send a dark shadow right through ya
To prepare you for all of the kniky things I'm gonna do to ya
And yes my dear if you got the goods
Then you might just see my face up in your neck of the woods
Ah word life y'all, a word life y'all
That's how I, shoot off arms just like a rifle
So just, pass the mic and let me spark this
So you can say that it's been blessed by the Prince of Darkness"
65,Put Your Weight On It,1990,Taste of Chocolate (1990),,Big Daddy Kane,"One for the ace and two for the deuce
If you're ready Mister Cee cut the record real loose
And uh, test test test test, oh yes
I wanna bless the mic, I caress with finesse
Back off the microphone, you can't wreck it none
I'm like a nine, and you're just a Naked Gun
Some type of new jack, steppin in the area
Kind of reminds me of Eddie Murphy, Coming to America
But you can't approach this, rhymes are too ferocious
Do the knowledge as I quote this
Freddie Krueger, walkin' on Kane's street
Five chapters and I still ain't been beat
Bout time I turned the microphone loose
Anyone after me is just an excuse
Even the level of the devil or Exorcist
Can't get next to this
This is mayhem, so competition, say when
You're thinkin' that you're ready, so I can just play him
Or them, no matter the quan-tity, you don't want to be
In this battle, so just flee
'Cause I leave 'em panickin when I start damagin
Kickin this swift, leaves you stiff, like a mannequin
And frozen, this is a mind explosion
As the chosen flows in, the competition throws in
The towel, my sharp tongue is like a license
I strike like Mike, Tyson I be icin
Breakin the mic in half, just like a psychopath
But still smooth and cool, just like a draft
Leave the metro scared and petrol
Ain't No Half-Steppin', so I don't sweat no MC
Cause Michael Jackson couldn't say it clearer
My only comp is the man in the mirror
So any pretender, you never been to
The death zone, this is the wrath, do not enter
These ain't the grounds for MC's to be wanderin
These is the grounds that the Kane is conquerin
Lyrics are bright and recite on the mic to excite
Delight, ignite, a bright light and a fright night
For types who bite, to be quite like
The man with mic swingin' all tight, but can't get it right
You're just a sloppy, cheap carbon copy
Sent to ride off in the sun, said Kemosabi
As the Kane remains everlasting
With lyrics that's fast relief like aspirin
So allow me to relieve, or breathe contact
Your brain and remain like hairweave
'Cause I can reach each participant with a speech
That will teach, and have 'em hangin' like a leach
And yes still puttin' rappers in fear
So hold it right there, cause this is a nightmare
As I cause a killer scene, and cut like a guillotine
Any thoughts you had about winnin' is still a dream
Or more like a fantasy, tell me why can't you see
There ain't a way that you can touch or stand on me
You talk about how many rappers you slayed
But I'm like a renegade, so I never been afraid
So don't say hi to this Asiatic descendant
Just say peace and everything'll be splendid
Peace!
Mister Cee, put your weight on it
Boy put your weight on it, put your weight on it
Put your weight on it
Put your weight on it Mister Cee, put your weight on it!
I'm outta here!"

68,Raw,2001,The Very Best Of Big Daddy Kane (2001),,Big Daddy Kane,"Here I am ... R-A-W
Terrorist, here to bring trouble to
Phoney emcees, I move on and sieze
I just conquer, and stomp another rapper with ease
'Cause I'm at my apex and others are be-low
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo
Second to none, making emcees run
Also don't try to step to me, 'cause I ain't the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it, so I don't see why you all
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi
The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party, until the A.M.
I'll make a muscle, grab the mike and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme
With authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
I'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw
'Cause I get RAW!
I give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten
Or eaten, or just tookin out
You know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin' out
And real nervous, when I'm at your service
Also give me that title boy, you don't deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has ta
Be perfectly fitted, 'cause I'm committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya
I'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb
Also full of action, my name should be a verb
My voice will float, on every note
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get 'em in a battle and make them all history
Rulin and schoolin, emcees that I'm duelin
Watch 'em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin
On a throne, with a bronze microphone
Uhm, God bless the child that can hold his own
'Cause I get raw!
Chillin', killin' like a villain
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever, take a loss never
And the rhymes I bust, comin' off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smokin' or hittin or takin' a sniff
Only crushin emcees that be tryin' to riff
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic
Make emcees panic, they all get frantic
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rocked, but hey, what you expected?
I'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior
Rather like a samurai, and I;ll be damn if I
Ever let a Fisher-Price emcee hang
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone

""We gonna do a song, that you heard before..""
(Kane)
Here I am, r-a-w
A terrorist, here to bring trouble to
Phony MC's, I move on and seize
I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
'Cause I'm at my apex and others are below
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo
Second to none, making MC's run
So don't try to step to me, 'cause I ain't the one
I relieve rappers, just like tylenol
And they know it, so I don't see why you all
Try to front, perpetratin a stunt
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
I'm genuine like gucci, raw like sushi
To stage a rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create, chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party, until the a.m.
I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a
Little rhyme with authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than dynasty, or hill street blues
I'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw
'Cause I get raw!
""R-a-w"" (cut and scratched by mister cee 4x)
(Kane)
Attact, react, exact, the mack'll move you with
A strong song as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when you're hyped
Do damage on stage and injure the mic
As I shoot the gift, MC's stand stiff
While my rhymes stick to you like skippy and jif
Feel my blunt fist, or my death kiss
The rap soloist - you don't want none of this
Supreme in this era, I reign with terror
When I grab the mic, believe you're gonna hear a
Fascinating rhyme, as I enchant them
So let's all sing the big daddy anthem
Go with the flow, my rhymes grow like an afro
An entertaining gain, the kane'll never no
Problem, I could sneeze sniffle or cough
Eeee-even if I stutter I'ma still come off
Cause rappers can't understand the mics I rip
They sho' nuff ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped
But my apparatus is up to status
Don't ask who the baddest, or cause static
To make or break or take em, my rhymes hit the head
Put it to bed, so watch what's said
Save the bass for the piper, rearrange your tone
Take a loss and be forced from the danger zone
I get ill and kill at will
Teachin a skill that's real, yeah no frill
Just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill your head up!
""R-a-w"" -- don't even get up
Competition shut up, 'cause I'm raw!
""Help me!"" (cut and scratched 8x by mister cee)
(Kane)
The man at hand to rule and school to teach and reach
The blind to find their way from a to z
And be the most and boast the loudest rap
Again, to reign your domain (yeah kane)
The heat is on, so feel the fire
Come off the empire, all the more higher
Level of depth, one step beyond dope
The suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope
'Cause I never let 'em on top of me
I play 'em out like a game of monopoly
Let 'em speed around the board like an astro
Then send 'em to jail for tryin' to pass go
Shakin 'em up, breakin 'em up, takin' no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So let the volume increase, never to cease
I'ma release a masterpiece a slip of the tongue like grease
Rippin the mic to shreds, puttin' heads to bed
Code red cause the rhymes is bein said
By the asiatic printer of raw poetry
No hints or clues, you all know it's me
I go pound for pound and round for round to clown the sound
Profound it's bound to go down, uh
A lyrical knockout, showin I got clout
My comp should just drop out
Cause none of them can see me
I leave 'em winan like their name was bebe or cece
I get raw!"

Terrorist, here to bring trouble to

'Cause I'm at my apex and others are be-low
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo
Second to none, making emcees run
Also don't try to step to me, 'cause I ain't the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it, so I don't see why you all

The Sage of Rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem

While you stand dazed and amazed, I'll bust a little rhyme
With authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
I'm sure to score, endure for more without a flaw
'Cause I get RAW!
I give a speech like a reverend, rappers start severin
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been beaten
Or eaten, or just tookin out
You know, come to think about, I keep emcees lookin' out
And real nervous, when I'm at your service
Also give me that title boy, you don't deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme, you know that it has ta
Be perfectly fitted, 'cause I'm committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know, I'll damage ya
I'm not an amateur but a professional unquestionable, without a doubt superb
Also full of action, my name should be a verb
My voice will float, on every note
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so sail on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get 'em in a battle and make them all history
Rulin and schoolin, emcees that I'm duelin
Watch 'em all take a fall, as I sit back coolin
On a throne, with a bronze microphone
Uhm, God bless the child that can hold his own
'Cause I get raw!
Chillin', killin' like a villain
The meaning of RAW is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever, take a loss never
And the rhymes I bust, comin' off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smokin' or hittin or takin' a sniff
Only crushin emcees that be tryin' to riff
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic
Make emcees panic, they all get frantic
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rocked, but hey, what you expected?
I'll get raw for ya, just like a warrior
Rather like a samurai, and I;ll be damn if I
Ever let a Fisher-Price emcee hang
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but ying yang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And I'ma preach your funeral, tell me who in the world
Could ever come with more, I get RAW!"
71,Rest In Peace,1993,Looks Like a Job For... (1993),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Preacher)
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
For this somber occasion
Please join us in the mourning of this U-47
It was a great microphone in it's day
Until it met it's fate
One evening while it was in the studio
It was struck by the lyrical force of the Big Daddy Kane
So ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
May this microphone, rest, in peace...
(Big Daddy Kane)
Knock knock, guess who? Yes, ooh
The Bigger the B, the Iggah the I,
The Jigga the G is comin' through
Yes I'm the one with clout, they're all talkin' bout
To be frank, I have the flavor like sauerkraut
The microphone assassinator and furthermore
I murdered plenty rappers and believe that I'll murder more
So if you ask to give the Kane a go
You better treat me like drugs, and Just Say No
Because I utilize my skills to brutilize
And in a battle, man you should see what I do to guys
Whenever the mic's mine, I'll rock a hype rhyme
And come off, like dirty panties at nighttime
Cause any mic that I caress, I finesse
With zest, and just bless, best yet to progress
King Asiatic, no other rapper stands this
You couldn't be a King if you played hockey in Los Angeles
I gets pi-daid, top gri-dade, gotta admit ey
Point blank, the kid's stri-daight

74,Sex According To The Prince Of Darkness,1994,Daddy's Home (1994),,Big Daddy Kane,"(Female reporter)
The definition of sex varies with many people
In search of a few ways to define it
We asked actor/comedian Mr. Dolemite his definition of sex
And his response was...
(Dolemite)
Baby, sex is just like puttin' money in the bank
Once you take it out, the interest is all gone
(Female reporter)
Then we asked rap star Big Daddy Kane his definition of sex
And well *clears throat* according to the Prince of Darkness...
(Big Daddy Kane)
Here comes Kane the mack, the sex maniac
Bring on the honies and you can't restrain me back from ff...
... Nah I better not say the whole word
So uh, let's just say what make Whoopi like Goldberg
'Cause I wanna make you sweat, get you wet
Perform a miracle in this love duet, see baby
I play the game like Keno, plus I know the
+Scent of a Woman+ better than Al Pacino
And when it comes to girls, I show no mercy
They lick me on the chest and say, 'To hell with Hershey'
Now it's time for me to lick that body
And this is no +Ordinary Love+, ask Sade
Baby you're bound to perspire, when I use
The nipples on your breasts just like a pacifier
Honey please, keep your body at ease
And let me see what I can do with those 34 C's
I plan to lick your bellybutton my dear
And let my tongue walk five steps downstairs
The way that I plan to put this chocolate syrup to use
I'm gonna wake up in the mornin with a hairy sweettooth
And now you're under my spell like a magician
Abra-cadabra, good sex and I have ya
Laid out, waitin for a big treat
I'm not the Ku Klux Klan but I stay under sheets
And when it comes to sex, yo I'm the illest
Plus I know more +Diff'rent Strokes+ than Arnold and Willis
I make you feel the reel to reel you feel
When I break the headboard down like Shaquille
Then bend over doggy style and just watch me
Ride yo' black ass like I was still filmin +Posse+
Then I'm the one that gets the job done
My mattress have more bodies than Al Capone's, gun
When I get through givin' you mine, uh
Girls be callin me back like *69
So come on over here hottie, let me just
'Work that body, work that body'
Uh-huh, uh-huh...
Straight like that...
Aiyyo
How many real niggaz out there like to have sex
C'mon, just?
I said how many real niggaz out there like to have sex
C'mon, just?
And say SEX (SEX!)
Say AND MORE SEX (AND MORE SEX!)
Say I LIKE IT (I LIKE IT)
And say I LOVE IT (I LOVE IT)
Say I NEED IT (I NEED IT)

75,Shame!,1998,Veteranz' Day (1998),,Big Daddy Kane,"There's no myth or fable about the pimpin' at your label
What goes on under the table, why you think your deal is so unstable?
Now, whose the macaroni, A&R's acting phony
Once you make the matrimony, then he start to slackin' don't he
Or could it be the president that's being hesitant
Playin' his artist like a corner workin' specimen
And I ain't kidding you when I say it's political
The way they make a ridicule of artists can be pitiful
You know damn well there shouldn't be no company CO
Trying to show me about rap that's 53 or so
But yet and still they want to add advice, trying to keep their status right
When they should be working records for Gladys Knight
Who shape artists, man they catching rape charges
Once you sign on the dotted line, they lead you in the blind
Then you find, your state of revenue remains the same
Cause you getting less points than Steve Kerr be getting in a game
And just because it be too hardcore to judge it
They won't even touch it, and get to frontin' on the budget
When new artists come out, I can foresee the worst outcome
Cause everybody I know got beat their first album
So I took my contract to a lawyer so he can check it out (He don't know)
Then I took it to Dionne Warwick so she can read my hand (She don't know)
It's a shame, when artists gotta deal with cheats
They got game, for every young rapper they see out on the streets
You sign your name, they get like Big Red on the Five Heartbeats
Now who the blame, when you starvin' and your record label eats
Preach brother
They say the truth will set you free, but I see signs of treachery
Go on perpetually, here's how they get you G
They use the tricks, just to juice your mix
But cross be in their heart like a vampire stabbed with a crucifix
I had the enemy in my vicinity with the false identity
Of a friend to me to injure me
They ride along just to guide you wrong
Play like they beside you strong, and start to faking moves like Olajuwon
Who side you on, revealing all that low down dirty dealing
I can see your skin peeling it changed like a chameleon
First you believe in them, but once you disagree with them
They try to get Magilla repertoire and that ain't even them
And all those who has betrayed, be fast to fade
'Cause they cast a shade, with the masquerade
What's dealt, is low blows below the belt
Lord have mercy, I know how Julius Caesar must have felt
I start to think back when I was just a youth
I should have listened to the words of the God Born Truth
He said, ""look out for black snakes they all up in your cypher
Black snakes you can't see therefore they sneak up and they bite ya'""
They get to flippin' 'cause they think you slippin'
So remember, don't get to slippin' 'cause they get to flippin'
And trippin', what's that you grippin', beside your hippin'
You think my heart is skippin', go save that game for Scottie Pippen
It's a shame, to see how far left people be going
They got game, to think that all this time you said you know them
It ain't the same, Ah, so now you see the way they flowin'
Now who they blame, ain't nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing
Now, wait a minute, I'm starting to see lotsa, hip-hop imposters
Is rap a category at the Oscars?
Too much Nino Brown up in your life
Cause since then, man I done seen Wesley Snipes playin' a drag queen
But yet and still you want to mimic the stars of cinema
Pretending huh? So full of it they need an enema
Cause see dig, they all like to talk big
But then they want to renege, when there's a curling iron in their wig
You talking loud and saying nothing, what's the world becoming?
The frontin', now pay attention you may learn something
Now, I ain't knocking you, but come on let's be logical
You know that it's impossible to stop the unstoppable
I would suggest that they, go back and check my resume
Cause tunes that I made yesterday, can hang out with the best today
Peace to Easy Mo, 'cause he makes the beats to flow
And I grab the microphone and flip it like pizza dough
Shame
Now who the blame
I need to be the Mayor, so I can change the things around here
I need to be the Governor, I need to be the Governor"

When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back

Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
N-b-a style, fann-tastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight I write left-handed
'Cause I like, to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win lose or draw, I'm bookin whores, anyway

If I was fred, I think I'd have to bone betty
Suckin and luckin, hey, niggaz I'm duckin, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way

I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ah yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That is I thrown ya, scold ya, jones ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What did I just show ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
And see that I got, more essays than the Mexican
The messiah that's feared great, leavin' rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none! huh
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run
I see the way you're trying to get to me,
But with with speech impedi-meant, man you gotta come better g

Enough to make a crowd of women scream ""ow!""
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on ason, keep that in your head

Transformin on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon

So let's groove with the smooth operator"

Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'ma tell about
A minimum length, of rhymes of strength
And power, so listen to the man of the hour
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
Sing hoe, swing low, then yo the show
Will go on, as I perform
Transformin on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon

79,Somebody's Been Sleeping In My Bed,1994,Daddy's Home (1994),,Big Daddy Kane,"Now I'm a family man that works hard for the money
With the sweetest wife ever *smak* I love you honey
I buy her everything, if it takes my last dollar
Even her nails and her hair to be done at the beauty parlor
We spend ample time together, doin' dinner and a movie
And whatever else sounds groovy
And when we want real excitement and drama, word to momma
We walk around in our pajamas in the Bahamas
I love her and I need her and I never ever cheat her
I'm far too carin to be considered a woman beater
My style is gentle, romantic and friendly
Nothin' like the husband from _Sleeping With the Enemy_
I thought that she was in love with me
I used to think that she couldn't get enough of me
But lately things been seemin strange and...
Baby you changed"
80,Stop Shammin',1993,Looks Like a Job For... (1993),,Big Daddy Kane,"One-fifty-eight Lewis Avenue
Between Lafayette and Van Buren, that was back during
The days of hangin' on my Bed-Stuy block
With Spence and Mitch, followin my cousin Murdoch
All the brothers were real, goin' for what they feel
By the way, peace to my man Sha and Big Neal
Now in ninety-three I'm still bein me
You think my 'fridgerator ain't full of Olde E? Huh
A lot of times I get fly with a suit and a tie
Yeah I went from rags to riches but I still rock the saggy britches
And I don't try to act brand new
Eatin escargots and usin' words like ""rendezvous""
The ghetto life I've seen a lot overcome
Make a little money and then forget where they came from
Livin' a plastic lifestyle, you're more false than dentures
Don't make me pull your file -- stop shammin!"

Question... what has he done, for you lately?
Tell me... do y'all go for walks on the beach?
I just wanna know, if you had dinner at the pond
Or the drive-through at Mickey D's
You say the last movie y'all saw was _Jaws_? Mmm
Well never fear baby, the Big Daddy is here
I come up upon the scene to romance thee
With a little bit of T.L.C. to tickle your fancy
Give you protection, warmth and affection
Make sure you never feel any rejection
Without a doubt, I admire you, I have a desire to
Be a more better man prior to
Your past relationships, you've been datin
With all the wrong gentlemen, I'm more sentimental
In my own little way so (HEY!)
Whattaya say about givin' a play okay?
'Cause I'm not here to impress you, I wanna caress you
Posess you and bless you, nevertheless
To make you feel secure, and real sure
Mon cheri amore, pretty woman I adore
Don't shed a tear never fear my dear I'll be there
Anywhere with some Tender Lovin' Care

And since I got paid and blew up like a live grenade
It's been a three, four year stretch
And I'd just like to thank all of you
And this goes to everybody in the entire world
That means the United States, overseas in the U.K.
Way in Brazil, Japan, Africa, and everywhere else
I just wanna dedicate this one to you
Here's another groove that I'm bringin' to you kind of mellow

I'll have you dancin' in a Soul Train line
Pick up the pace and get a taste of B-I-G

Doin' the job how you want it done
With lyrics that's bright as the morning sun
So grab one line, rub it on your face like sunshine
And everything else'll combine
This is that particular beat
For all the fellows feelin' mellow to pump in the Jeep
Uh, also for every girlie
To shamiyo, shamago like Laverne and Shirley
Huh, now wait, now wait, now wait a minute
Uh! Now check this
I wanna talk about peace and unity and love

84,Terra N Ya Era,1998,Veteranz' Day (1998),,Big Daddy Kane,"You looking in the mouth of madness, skilled out since I had this
I'm talking 'bout nothing but pure d badness
My acceleration is compatible to a bima
My pockets looking greener, from the funky cold medina
Don't tell me 'bout the things that you done did 'cause I done did it
Don't tell me 'bout the skins that you done hit, 'cause I done hit it
And once I rock these, with a style that's cock deis
Good god, I get the crowd together like knock knees
Now, I don't act hard, I just mack hard
Baggin' video looking honeys with the big back yard
Yes lord, girls I'm gamin' leaving the microphone flamin'
Throwing up hip-hop signs cause that's the set that I be claimin'
Guerilla war fares for those who love to pull your card
Grimies from fort green to malcolm x boulevard
Now, if that's what you're hoping then it's the wrong things you're scopin'
I may not rap bout slittin no throats but trust me kid I'll get you open
Here comes a taste of the rawness, like you never saw this
Once I grip the cordless, my victory is flawless
Chaos and havoc, lyrically psychopathic
At times get pornographic, lord man I gots to have it
Then I commit to hit you with this composite that's ultimate
Too legit splendid come get wit' it for your comfort
But then sloppily, rappers try to copy me
Take pieces of my property, and use it all unproperly
And probably, been focusing a while to copy my style
But child what I'll compile is too versatile
I'm too superior, it's sort of like comparing a
Spanking new desert eagle to a rusty little derringer
But skip the tool, let's try to deal here with the jewel
That I'm droppin' on you, now let me take you all to school
You see, to graduate in hip-hop you must be smart
And no you don't have to know how to paint to make your rhymes a form of art
Poetry and literature is what makes this English fanatic
Now dig this, I drop science but still deal with mathematics
And since I don't be dealing with what's considered a mystery
I learned the dead presidents to pass American history
Got my degree in rapology
Hip-hop had to set me free, look mom, a real emcee
So you want yours now, well don't get caught with your drawers down
Cause word life, this industry is half corrupt just like the dogg pound
Rap godfather
Oh goodness gracious, you better make it spacious
For the vivacious, ostentatious, who feel courageous?
I put it on them using my tongue as a sword
But at times get broader than broad for those who insist to get floored
Whatever it takes to see your nerve gone, and word born
Black caesar gonna get his swerve on
My name should be referred to in medical terms
'Cause I get way up in the cut and I'm talking way worse than germs
You like to chase it playin' catch like tom and jerry
But on the contrary, I'd rather sip the dom peri
Lay back in harmony, because it's so bizarre to see
That all the hard core rappers are slowly turning r&b
Well pardon me, you contradict yo'self, I see you not perfect yo'self
You like that type music yo'self, stick yo'self
What happened to black men of pride 'nuff men have died
Nowadays what's been applied, in hip-hop is genocide
That's when the rappers go get the clappers
Can't you see they trying to strap us just to trap us, good God it's backwards
One nation under a groove, that's how we move
It's time to teach the youth get it together show and prove
Me no run with the gun or speak of none for action
When you get done scream I'm the one, it looks like an illusion
I deal with equality so never call my brethren son
Yes mon, me got mad flava just like jerk chicken"
85,That's How I Did 'Em,1994,Daddy's Home (1994),,Big Daddy Kane,"Daddy daddy tell me a story of how you took out that wack MC
No daddy, tell them how you beat down that bootlegger
Daddy daddy tell us a story!
Heh heh, all right, all right, all right y'all OK
Come on y'all, crowd around daddy now OK? c'mon
Y'all just sit there and listen
I'ma tell you about the MC
And I'ma tell you about the bootlegger, OK?
Here we go children
It happened at a jam, some kid tried to sham on the program
So I had to silence the lamb and show him who I am
So I just set it off on my competitor
Freakin' the funk as I hit 'em with crazy metaphors
Like back up off me dukes, because you're trippin'
You better dry your cranium off, cause your brain is slippin'
You beatin' me is somethin' that I doubt
The only way you could bake kane is workin' in a crackhouse
No man alive can withstand the kane flow
I kick so much flavor that my shoes loOK like a rainbow
You need a whole lot of practice, you thought that you was
On the money so I took you out like taxes!
Now you can flea off, releasin' me g, easy be
To keep the great MC
Then I throw 'em I lean and mean record to spark
So I can school that ass just like Joe Clark
Next I translated, my rap is more educated
And made it complicated for him to illustrate it
My dexterity, put him in fear of me
And had his mind bewildered by everything he was hearin' see
That was enough to slow his whole train of thought down
So I just speeded the pace up more than enough for him to come around
I triple the words, when makin' the rhymes, whatever the rhythm
Puttin' his mind in a prison
And oh yeah, that's how I did em
That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah)
That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah)
That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah)
That's how I did 'em (hey)
I was out flex, lookin' cold sex in a lex'
Sippin' on a beck's, pumpin' the remix of Das Efx
Drive down 125th with my man
And what did I see, bein' sold at the stand?
A bunch of bootleg tapes that he had claim on it
So I snatched everything with my name on it
And give me that kool g. rap tape, and give me that ice cube
And all the wu-tang joints, 'cause they're my boys too
A man tryin' to make a livin', I can't knock it
But now you tried to take money out of my pocket
Word to miz, what the problem is, is that the kids
Didn't buy it from the wiz, they bought your shaky fibs so
Now it's time to move him off the block
Pass me the glock 'cause I might make a body rock
And I'll break down sixteen shots
That's one + eight + seven on a undercover
Bootlegger, you're worse than a beggar
Makin' a fake profit, stop it
'Cause I work hard for the money, to make cash flow
To have another come along and take my dough
No
So I just told my man, aiyyo
Throw the tapes in the Lexus
Then we burned his whole stand down just like Waco, Texas
And then I jumped on the brother, with rage
Crushed his ribcage, damn did he get slayed
'Cause I don't think he even know whatever hit him
Bootleggers beware, cause yeah I did em
That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah)
That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah)
That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah)
That's how I did 'em (hey)
Give it your best shot, bring it with all you got
And watch the bombs I drop just rock your knot
Cause it ain't wise to address me
I wouldn't advise a schoolteacher to test me
'Cause I don't just do em, I run through em
And I don't just hurt, uh uh, I body work em
Lyrical torture, never could support ya
For steppin' to me, agony is what it brought ya
Cause you never seen this type of lyrical genius
That could never be touched, and I mean this
So one love, I'ma leave you with the rhythm
Ain't no need to go off, cause yo hon know I did em
That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah)
That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah)
That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah)
That's how I did 'em (hey)"
86,The Beef Is On,1993,Looks Like a Job For... (1993),,Big Daddy Kane,"It's hell up in Harlem, my main man just caught a bad one
Wetted by a magnum when he didn't have none
That goes to show you that even when you're respected
Brothers'll still try ya if they think you're butt-naked
So I went uptown to get the low-down
To see who made the whole thing go down
Word on the streets had it
Some kids from the Bronx with automatics
Came to start static
Some new jacks at the game
Tryin' to get a name
Had a point to prove
Wrong move
So I can't wait to get 'em all straight
It's a big payback when I retaliate
Steam, I gotta let it off
And I can't wait to set it off
To revenge my main man that's gone
And as sure as my name is Kane, word is bond
The beef is on
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef)
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)
It's time to show them how to get hard
Callin a hit squad and pull all these clown's ciddard
For tryin' to friddont and fiddake the middood
But when I get riddude - awesome dude
So I took a little trip to Brooklyn
Bedstuy Do-Or-Die is where I was lookin'
For my boys from Roosevelt, Albany and Marcy
Plus I got a posse over in Canarsie
I'm talkin' about ill brothers that don't play
They sit around watchin 'Scarface' all day
So here we go, headed up to they scene
Twenty deep in a van like the A-Team
We rolled up to see what this joint's about
When one of my boys in the van just pointed 'em out
So without delay we reacted
And started shootin like it was target practice
When they saw that we wasn't messin around
One tried to run, so I had to chase him down
I caught the kid by the corner store deli
Kicked him in the belly like I was Jeff Kelley
I did his jugular vein something violent
Came back to see my crew made the rest silent
We sent fifteen bodies to Trapper John
'Cause the beef was on
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef)
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)
(I don't happen to trust people
I sort of figured if you thought I was weak
You'd mop the street up with me
And I got to kill a lot more of your people
To put you in your place)
(You send your boys in I send 'em back in a paperbag)
Many screamed about a homicide
But when I came to shut 'em down all the drama died
I plead insanity when I got a jam with me
And we roll like the Corleone family
I bring the boys that'll bring the noise
In the aftermath everything's destroyed
Like a crew of barbarians
And brothers that want beef, I make 'em vegetarians
So don't even front and try to put it as if you're ruff
'Cause soon as I see ya, best believe I'ma call your bluff
And everyone else that tried to press up on me tuff
Have fallen and they can't get up
My game is a ill one
'Cause I'm a real one
Lorda mercy
Nuff controversy
A gangster, a khan
A pimp and a don
Waitin for the beef to be on"
87,The Day You're Mine,1988,Long Live the Kane (1988),,Big Daddy Kane,"Talk about ever meeting Ms. Right
But one thing I know is this girl is hype
Not a crab I see but such a lovely female
And if looks could kill, she would be in jail
For raving all over with exotic beauty
And to captivate her love is my only duty
There's not a single feature that this girl lacks
Sweetheart, you're my aphrodisiac
<Straight R&B Chorus>
You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine
Now I've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies
But I swear my dear, none appear on your level baby
Maybe, it's just me imagining
Then again, I probably just haven't been
With the right female and in detail
I'll probably never will be, girl if we fail
Cause every time I appear to be pleased
You know what happens?
I just get skeezed
<Straight R&B Chorus>
The girl that I admire, one that I desire
And no one can stop the feelings that you inspire
The way that you leave me in this obsession
With the chambers of my heart in your possession
We were meant to be together, always and forever
For that engagement, I shall endeavor
Pray for the day that we combine
And I can say for sure that you're truly mine
In benevolence and reverence
As soon as our relationship commence
But for now, I wait impatiently
For the day that you can give your all to me
<You've got me waiting for you day by day>
The moment of truth is what I really should call it
I worked so hard for it so please don't spoil it
Yeah it's a lot that I'm asking you to give me
That's only because I need you with me
Side by side, hand in hand
You as my girl and Kane as your man
Bust it, ever since the first time that I seen her
I wanted her to step inside my arena
I'd be the champion of love, wear the golden glove
And show you what a real man is made of
My feelings I'm sharing because I'm caring
My heart'll tell you why I am so endearing
For a chance at romance I would love to enhance
I would be your man under any circumstance
Just as long as I can say that you're my own
Your feelings for me and mine alone
We can cherish every moment of the time we spent
Try to take our love to the full extent
The point that I'm trying so hard to get through
Is girl, I'm in love with you
<Straight R&B Chorus>
A dramatic fanatic for our relation
Cupid has me stupid with infatuation
And a fashion of passion so tenderly
With vibes I can't describe you send to me
This personal attachment in which I feel
To you my dear, I will try to reveal
All over and over, I'll try and try
Because to see you with the next man makes me cry
I feel that I should be the only man to side you
Cause no one can love you the way that I do
No one deserve the love you can give
So allow me to show you how I'm out to live
With something very special, palliative and pure
And anything that you want, I can give you more
I'll be calm and gentle, loving and sentimental
Oh so much emotion, I'm talking devotion
'Cause when I get involved, I get involved so deep
That you would know that my love is something special to keep
But for now, I guess I'll be fine
And keep waiting for the day that you'll be mine"

All that, ""Yo baby yo baby,"" it's... it's-it's-it's not the move
You gotta treat 'em with respect, never neglect
Try to protect, most of all, project some intellect
Present yourself all proper is important if you truly do want her
So be a gentlemen, and be in her corner
Make her feel like the most
For example -- forget Goodfellas, and take her to see Ghost
Wine and dine under candlelight
Make the mood right tonight while the stars are bright
Then hop in the hot tub and start to rub her on her back
Tssssh, yeah they like that
Satisfaction guaranteed
We gotta give the woman what she need
These days, they don't be fallin' for no phony Casanova
Since they started watchin Oprah
So even if it's not your style
Open the door for them once in a while
Even buyin them some flowers don't hurt
Yeah it sounds old fashioned... but it works!
Conversation, good communication
Only makes things better in a relation
'Cause if you keep watchin the game every week
You might find out your wife's gettin' dunked by Dominique
And that can be so upsettin
So try a little Tenderness like Otis Redding
Put the gangster approach on pause

You better change your name to 5000 'cause you're audi
And if you bring on your crew, I'm steppin to them too
Just put the beat on and watch how I swing through

I realized that hearts get broken, sweetheart
I couldn't stand the wound (can't stand the wound)
So I put mines in your hands girl
And it's all yours my dear
But you got to be gentle, 'cause it's fragile see
That means handle with care (handle with care)

You remember -- backstage at my show
I thought that I was the star until I saw you
(But I did not love her) (I did not love her)
Escapin from the crowd to be alone witchu
'Cause I had oh so much to say
As we sat down in my dressin room girl, huh

Just like the back of my hand (I love you, I love you)
Loved you like I never loved another (I loved you)

And said that's where I gotta go
So here I am, paid in the rap trade
But still gettin' played, for my darker shade
That's not the only P-R-O-B-L-E-M
Man, that's just the beginnin of them
For example, I can't walk the streets alone...
... Without bein known
Don't get me wrong, cause deep in my heart I do love it
But I can't even dig up my nose in public, huh
MC Rell couldn't have said it no plainer
Yeah, that's the life of an entertainer
And the times are so hard to understand
That it makes me a troubled man
* Mister Cee cuts up Chuck D saying ""I got so much trouble on my mind"" *
(Big Daddy Kane)
I like women, but I hate womankind
Love can be just too much for the mind
'Cause I've toured the world from state to state
And wouldn't lay down tonight without havin' a mate
Married girls in tight miniskirts
That left they husband waitin at the concert
I don't discriminate with girls that I talk to
I take 'em Mello-Yello to Chocolate Yoo-hoo
But now I couldn't find the right girl to fit me
Not even if she walked into my face and bit me
You see it's hard to make a woman your wife
When you've been humpin married woman the most of your life
You better believe that's true, word up
'Cause if it happened to me, then it can happen to you
I'm not tryin' to say that a woman is scandalous
I'm just showin you who the troubled man is
* Mister Cee cuts up Chuck D saying ""I got so much trouble on my mind"" *
(Big Daddy Kane)
Brothers from the past...
... In the streets of Bed-Stuy or my ?Sara J? class
Some of them are cool, some of them at times can be a bother
Thinkin' I got jobs to give like Roy Rogers
I try to explain I'm not on tour yet
And they say, ""You think you're all that? Yeah, I bet!""
So when I see 'em on the solo tip
I gotta throw joints to prove my point
Just when I thought that I had the neighborhood support
Here comes another battle to be fought, huh
You know they even tried to start a AIDS rumor
Diggin the kind of life, that would maybe doom a
Brother of my priniciple, you'd think some of these people
Would be more sensisble, because a lie like that
Didn't bring my sex flow to an end
Maaaaaaaan, I'm still gettin' skins!
And the beat goes on until the thrill is gone
And life is the same old song
And maybe one day you can understand
What it's like to be a troubled man
* Mister Cee cuts up Chuck D saying ""I got so much trouble on my mind"" *"
93,"Uncut, Pure",1998,Veteranz' Day (1998),,Big Daddy Kane,"See the crowd in an uproar acting unstable
Here comes dark gable raps remarkable
Mic ripper, cash flipper, cristal sipper
Derrie're batalliere that's French for ass whipper
Long time putting work in this, to be tremendous
If I'm not the best then I'm a damn striking resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attacking this enrage to disengage the missing page
To the newest in age that's hitting stage
For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat, if you was rosa parks
Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make
Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes
You know the lick, seen me hit 'em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick, not that click from mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean a sat
Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me
Pardon the vainglory, but here's the kane story
Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky
Fuck the chorus
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you
Was invisible it'll make your life miserable
Hip-hop icon, keep a grip like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy you got to get that playa hatin' out you
That's the other side of the game and I ain't erykah badu
Black caesar, don't you even reach my way
You'd sooner find a vital point that's on priest pai mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhyming
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment
The untouchable, don't want to tempt me
I come kicking through your door, unlawful entry
It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me
For real, damn I know how jehovah's witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
'Cause I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look I think the kane about to overcook
Come and get it, but you better come with paramedics
Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for fed ex
I come cutting through split his gut in two
I touch 'em what 'em do you know the style ain't nothing new
Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down baby we keep it live
A good game it lets the plot thicken,
But the thing that just ain't clickin'
Is the way y'all legalize trickin'
You talk about your ride and you don't even got one
But I can pull a hot one, when inside of a datsun
The wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red
Let the messiah take you higher as I supply ya' what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as I'm guttin' 'em black
Closest thing to me would be; nothin' in fact
I come with more in skill, to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill, sweeter thang than lauryn hill
As I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence
Approach them all with some bad intentions
In other words I'm making them resign, diminish mine
Runnin' through them like a finish line"

Somehow it wasn't done right, then he just laced him with one bite
Go for the jugular vein, that's my new thing
How did you do it with two fangs, think they were gold like Wu-tang
Your luck has been changed, you're left strucken with pain
Well good for your ass kid, that's what you get for fucking with Kane.
I creep on MC's like po' nine and take rhymes the whole nine
To dig in you rappers like a coalmine
Now look what I dug me, somebody better turn me off or try to unplug me
Ooh it's starting to get ugly
Don't miss this, hold on with a clenched fist
As I tongue the microphone down just like a French kiss.
Relentless with lyrics that be brutal, hip-hop I stay true to
Put it on you like voodoo
Unda presha, niggas unfold and felt the heat
Possessed with the Brooklyn techniques we freak
Ay yo Kane, hit us off with that shit one time
They can't believe it, infatuated hardcore rhymes
When you diggin' out your girl from behind, you're gonna find
The reason that her eyes are closed, Black Caesar's on her mind
Dig this now, run for your life to get away but none do
Even if you escape just tell me who can you run to
Test the, stupendous, tell me what was you to gain
Internal bleeding, due to Kane
Boom bow bow, ooh, the pain
Nobody's equal, keep it lethal, and diesel, to see to the people
And reach your cerebral cause that's how we do
The pain gets inflicted, fake MC's get evicted
Face it, truth of the matter is just that I'm too hard to get with
Since days of Pro Keds, I shined over mad heads, roll up on you like the Feds
Rip your whole set to shreds
A crash or a wreck, because I mash for respect
Only thing I want to know now, is this cash or a check?
Ain't no question,
I'm suffering a bad case of lyrical congestion
Not the one for testing,
Come mess with and end up with your chest split
No, not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act.
I'm recognized as the microphone destroyer
Competition minds in the state of paranoia
I said if you're scared, get a dog
So by tomorrow you'll probably see 20 rappers walking with Rotweilers
Your gimmick is primitive, and impotent
You won't win with it so limit it
Before I make your body start to hemorrhage
Just when you thought that you was burning me
You found yourself bleeding internally
Now you heads is l"

People people, we gotta get over
Before we go under, and I wonder
Why we can't find a little piece of mankind
Instead of always step back, gimme my damn nine
Livin' the thug, like the shoot up the drug type
They love to hear the people sayin', ""Yo that kid is bugged right?""
Just a game, so please, out here men die
The average black man today don't make it to see twenty-five
Cause someone else got the clock rocked
Tryin' to get the neighborhood locked, to be the new man on the block
But if you asked me who's the man I'm like, ""You tell me?
I don't know, Ed Lover, Dr. Dre and Heavy D?""
I got my mind on comin' up, if not in first place
Then damnit I plan to be the first runner up

Creatin' drama when I'm on the scene
And I pack 'em in mean, like bruce springsteen
I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
Put on trial a rap pile to exile
Make you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just crumble
And I'm still calm and humble
You need another helpin hand to swing on
I stand alone, but still you gotta bring on
Your batman and robin, cagney and lacey
Starsky and hutch, but they still can't face me
And if may make this one thing here clear
That's for you not to come near, period
So I ain't buggin or delirious
My swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is
And I can slice and dice a fisher price MC
That thought he was nice into minute rice
Single-handed, I ain't with that band stuff

Due to wack lyrics, it's bout to short circuit
So toss the sauce across to the boss, no remorse
You lost, with force, of course, a holocaust
First I caught ya, then put ya through torture
You moved wrong my son, so I taught ya
Just like a guardian, that put your body in

Scheme and fiend to take a bite like dracula
And waste the taste, cause ain't no sugar here
So come near if you dare, you booga bear
You start hallucinatin like magic
The wrath gets tragic, but kane won't have it
Cause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin
Slowed the pace, so I had to start rushin
So pick a vc date, 'cause you're history
Here comes kane scoob scrap jay and mister cee
And this is one thing to us we ain't new to
The crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo

101,Who Am I,1990,Taste of Chocolate (1990),,Big Daddy Kane,"*I was born...*
...A black man from the motherland
Speakin' a language today most people don't understand
Where no one could bother me
'Cause I had freedom, justice and equality
But then one day it was tooken away
And I was shipped to the U.S.A.
A young brother, made into a slave
To harvest the midlands and clean the chittlins
Given a new name, new religion
No freedom to vote, not even to make a decision
I saw my peoples, sold raped and took out
The rest of that stuff that Alex Haley talks about
They said I'm not from Asia I'm from Africa
And all the blacks there now are just scavengers
That's the way my mind was poisoned
To believe that in America blacks are inferior
A weak mind and a body of swine
Only adds up to being - deaf dumb and blind
Illiterate to who where what and why
So I ask myself: who am I?
*I was born...*
...A native New Yorker on the streets
Known for rockin' rhymes to real rough beats
That I found in the attic, noisy with static
A sound that made me a hip-hop fanatic
I made a few songs that sold OK
Never top 20 or plenty airplay
I came out hardcore, flexin cock diesel
Saw a little cash, and pop goes the weasel
I had to make that change and rearrange
My whole rap format, no hardcore rap
So now all the pop charts I rule
Over New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul, huh
I thought I made it, then my song faded
And none of the black stations ever have played it
I tried to blame it on MTV
And say, ""Damn, they cold played me for Young MC""
But when you get down to it, I'm the real blame
Because I wanted the fame
Money is not only the root of all evil
It's also the destruction of black people, so
Conjunction junction, what's your function?
Bein a scout, or sellin out?
Look in the mirror at yourself, eye to eye
And say: who am I?
A solid change, have to rearrange this strange feelin'
I'm feelin', so appealin
I am having to deal with
Time to forget the myth, of bein black and a woman
Can't get ahead, walkin' on a thread, a tightrope
Can't cope, don't be a dope,
Have a little bit of hope Runnin' your scope on affairs
You have to be aware, don't flare up
Let your cup runneth over I'm not Irish,
Don't need a donut to fill up my dish
Nor two mango wish to wish on a star,
They're so far
Anyway I'm thinkin' about today, not tomorrow
I'm not a follower of anyone
My time has come, it's already here
My message is clear
Like the women of long ago, I am also here
Also to show, I have the courage
Have the strength, I'm for equal opportunity
No matter the life, length of time
Show me a sign, should I rely on a
Subliminal message, should I question
What would seem to be, life's told me?
Yes indeed, so let me speak
And that's comin' from the daughter of Malcolm X
So black women put it in your texts
So you can never let opportunity pass you by
Or even ask yourself, who am I?"
102,Word To The Mother (Land),1988,Long Live the Kane (1988),,Big Daddy Kane,"Grab a hold of yourself, open your eyes
Get wise to the exercise
Being taught by the teacher that's most dominant
You need knowledge?
Well I'm dropping it
Listen to the rap allow it to trap
Your body and soul so that you can adapt
To the man on display as I take you away
So may I?
<Yes you may!>
Proud to be a Black man
Coming exact and
Giving up to brothers five on the back hand
Pray for lease and peace upon each other
With my sisters and brothers
<Marley Marl: yo, word to the mother!>
I say the mother, as in the motherland
But on the other hand, another man
Tackled and shackled our ancestors
But we beat him with freedom, so let's bless the
Country that we all came from
Because the moral of it all is we shall overcome
The cream will keep rising
We be sizing
Up, the Asiatic one is enterprising
Building and building to carry on
All the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan
Martin Luther was a tutor, many were pupils
Those who fell victim were those without scruples
However, to sever, we could never
So hold up the peace sign and stand together
Take heed to the words that I manifest
And when I'm through speaking, Marley Marlæ£l do the rest

Yo Big Daddy, what you gonna say now?>
Take a stand the fight for power
'Cause weæ³e been here before the Mayflower
Living superior abiding by nature
The history of the Asiatic one paid the
Price to be paid in slavery
Like the name of Antonio was gave to me
But knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain
Now I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane
The teacher, teaching a lesson to be heard
That's word, to the mother my brother
So discover the truth of one another
Cause hereæ¯ the real deal upon our skin color
Lay down white, yellow, red or pink
But the color of black is most dominant
The rising and sizing can never cease
<Marley Marl: what you going say now?>
Peace!
<Farrakhan: ...the mother of all living things and the Black man
Is the original man, we just can't escape our destiny>

103,Word To The Mother (Land),2001,The Very Best Of Big Daddy Kane (2001),,Big Daddy Kane,"Grab a hold of yourself, open your eyes
Get wise to the exercise
Being taught by the teacher that's most dominant
You need knowledge?
Well I'm dropping it
Listen to the rap allow it to trap
Your body and soul so that you can adapt
To the man on display as I take you away
So may I?
<Yes you may!>
Proud to be a Black man
Coming exact and
Giving up to brothers five on the back hand
Pray for lease and peace upon each other
With my sisters and brothers
<Marley Marl: yo, word to the mother!>
I say the mother, as in the motherland
But on the other hand, another man
Tackled and shackled our ancestors
But we beat him with freedom, so let's bless the
Country that we all came from
Because the moral of it all is we shall overcome
The cream will keep rising
We be sizing
Up, the Asiatic one is enterprising
Building and building to carry on
All the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan
Martin Luther was a tutor, many were pupils
Those who fell victim were those without scruples
However, to sever, we could never
So hold up the peace sign and stand together
Take heed to the words that I manifest
And when I'm through speaking, Marley Marlæ£l do the rest

People, people
We gotta get over, before we go under (x2)

104,Wrath Of Kane (Live),1989,It's a Big Daddy Thing (1989),,Big Daddy Kane,"He has arrived, at the Apollo
Can I see the peace sign up in the air?
You know what this is?
The wrath of Kane, takin' over your circumference
Destroyin' negativity, and suckers that come with
The weak, the wack, the words, they're poor
I thrash bash clash mash and ten more
Blow up the scenery, I reign supremer, see
You need a savior to save ya, so lean on me
I'm playin' rappers like a haunted ghost
And stomp 'em out like a watered roach
I slay my pray and they decay, I blow away and throw away
So go away, 'cause I don't play
Attackin' like a psychopath breakin' rappers in half
So feel the wrath of Kane!
The man at hand, to rule and school and teach
And reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
And be the most, and boast the loudest rap
Kane'll reign your domain!
The heat is on, so feel the fire
Come off the empire, all the more higher
Level of def one step beyond dope
You suckers all scope and hope to cope but NOPE
'Cause I can never let 'em on top of me
I play 'em out like a game of Monopoly
Let us beat around the ball like an Astro
Then send 'em to jail for tryin' to pass Go
Shakin' 'em up, breakin' 'em up, takin' no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So Mister Cee let the volume grow
So I can flow, now yo
Juice Crew's the family, Slick Rick's a friend of me
And Doug E. Fresh, Stet', KRS and Public Enemy
Blase blah, you know who you are
The red black and green, the sun moon and star
Knowledge of Self, degree of twenty-one after
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reach and each
With the speech every leecher I'm impeach
Drop science and build with math
And the dumb deaf and blind'll feel the wrath, of Kane!
Marley Marl break it down!
Line by line, chapter after chapter
Like a pimp on the street, I got a rap ta
Those who chose to oppose, friend or foes I still dispose
Blow 'em out like afros
Too many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Yellin' and screamin' and jeerin' but still came out
Off the wall as butter soft-er y'all
So you waited for Kane, to come after all
Competition, that bite and chew and crunch and munch
To play me out position, you on a mission
But stop lyin' and tryin' to front adventures
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Freeze, as I get warm like a heater
Bite like a mosquito, but still can't complete a
Rhyme or find the time to design a line
Or phrase that pays, so you down in rhyme
I get busy from sun to sun
Only twenty-one, untouched by anyone
No one throws, bangs or blows
All foes I keep 'em runnin' like pantyhose
They got soft and tender, front and they'll surrender
I turned off more lights than Teddy Pendergrass
Bring on the trial, war be my style
But when I'm in effect, they feel the wrath, of Kane!
Alright, pump your fists in the air like this y'all
C'mon let me see the fists in the air
C'mon y'all
And let me hear you say yeah, c'mon
(Yeah)
C'mon now, yeah, c'mon!
(Yeah)
Everybody, yeah, what?
(Yeah)
Yeah, c'mon
(Yeah)
And say hoe-oh (hoe-oh) hoe-oh (hoe-oh)
Say yo baby, yo baby, yo
(Yo baby, yo baby, yo!)
And just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
If you're gettin' cash money and not welfare
Somebody say, ooh yeah! (ooh yeah!)
Ooh yeah! (ooh yeah)
Apollo Theater, I love y'all

So out of the MERCY of Allah
And the LAW, written in our nature
We call an INDIVIDUAL, into existence
And when that individual, I make, NO apologies
For what I'm about to say
(Big Daddy Kane)
Rough, rugged and real, you're on standstill
To obey okay so let the man build
Words of rapture that you have to capture
And I just slapped ya
With the hand full of literature
That's dope def fresh hype choice smooth and raw
Rappers I replace, rub out, and erase
Competition you must be on freebase
Smokin' or chokin, bound to be broken
Man, get your damn hands off the mic that I'm chokin!
'Cause I got a strangehold
You're still cold off the road for the role you stole
Rhymes that you yell out, but you did sell out
Crossed-over, lost over here, now get the hell out
I'm not a pop star, rock'n'roller
I'm a rebel, BLESSED, able to hold a
Mic like a hammer, and drop grammar
Treat a rapper like a wrestler, and body slam him
Those who dispute get treated just like a prostitute
They get the boot and played like a flute
So just PLAY mute, don't even whisper
Open your mouth to speak and I'm diss ya
Ragtag and dog, put you in the morgue
Because you're petty confetti and not ready to rock steady
In other words, you're half-steppin'
Tiptoein, get goin', because my weapon
Is not a nine, an uzi or a shotgun
But when it come to hype rhymes I got one
Just like the album is still the same
_Long Live the Kane_ ain't a damn thing changed
I still get ill and kill at will and build the skill
To fill your grill so don't tell me you're real
We sample beats, you sue and try to fight us
*Tchk* Maaaan, you still be home with arthritis!
If we didn't revive em, bring back alive
Old beats that we appreciated, you wouldn't survive
You'd be another memory to us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So understand, the way that I live
That's positive - and the message I got to give
It's a benefit for you and me
I'm talkin' bout P.E.A.C.E.
The chosen one that has turned a new leaf
I got gold teeth, and they don't chew beef
No pork on my fork, strictly fish on my dish
The Kane fallin' victim? *tchk* Sucker, you wish
I flow like water, slaughter
Put you out of order... floored ya!
Rappers are raggin and taggin and snaggin and braggin
To be on the bandwagon, but I'm the Last Dragon
With the knack to attract the pack
So just GET BACK, I'm young, gifted and black
And just go with the flow you know
In the place to be with my man Marley Marl
Sendin this out to Divine Force
Can't forget my main man Heavy D
And to my good brothers EPMD
And to my man Ice-T over on the West Coast
Can't forget Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee, MC Lyte, the Audio Two
I say, peace!"
