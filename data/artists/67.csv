0,Air It Out,2004,Kiss of Death (2004),,Jadakiss,"(Jadakiss)
Work wit me
I wanna thank y'all fa comin' out
Tonight
Dis iz sum reel' shit
Ah--hah
(Jadakiss)
First things first
When a nigga money ain't right
That makes things worst
Now he's just breathing he can barely manage
And he's way past starvin
He's really famished
His right-hand man is up north, that's hurtin' em
His cellphone bout to cut off, spring jerkin em
And his baby moms startin to do her thing again
She left him for a nigga pumpin e up in Binghamton
If his money is right than maybe he can diss her
But he can't, and niggas is breakin his little sister
His pops just past
His mom use to be an occasional sniffer
Then she started fuckin' with the gas
Dude use to be a star back then
He had the benz CL something
But he just turned his car back in
Mad carrots pawned all his rings
Took this thing next thing I know
Money pawned all his bling
Now he just like everybody
With the same old plans
That can't get over the hump
With the same old grams
They was on the block making fun of him
He slid off came back with his hammer and killed everyone of em
'Cause when I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe
Me and B.I go man to man
I know niggas with an asshole
Full of parole that go hand in hand
Fuck hot that's humidity
And you can't mix money with stupidity
Even though I get my coke from Columbia
My cars from Germany
And my guns from Sicily
Nothin' personal but I was raised different
Hold my joint sideways so I blaze different
Give it to anybody fuck an age difference
From those in the world to those in the ca****
Rub the kite on your chest and swallow the stamp
At the end of the day they still gonna follow the champ
It ain't about being lyrical
'Cause when I get in the booth
I make miracles and I ain't stared at you
But I'm in tune with the hood so I'm better than you
And when you see me comin' you know what is better to do
(Jadakiss)
Can't lie all I got is my balls and my vocals
And the only security I roll wit is my social
It don't look decent
It's like niggas left they crew in the hood
And went on the rode with the presint
Had it up to here with this fake shit
They don't even want a nigga to earn his
Just give and take shit
Just make sure you mention my name in da top brackets
And make sure you mention your name as the top faggot
Trust me this go around I will not have it
I putin niggas heads to bed like crapmadics
How you think your man died
More money than respect
And it wasn't close it was by a landslide
Listen my nigga your work is sloppy
And I don't love them hoes but the purple got me
If I don't don't do it with music imma do it wit poppy
Just play the sideline and observe and watch me
Let's go"
1,Bring You Down,2004,Kiss of Death (2004),,Jadakiss,"Verse 1 Jadakiss (rapping)
Top of the food chain
Its just the way that I do things
The dungeree seats in the blue range
I'm workin' with new change
A gemni nigger wit mood swings
Had the fiends lookin' for new veins
I stopped playin' with verbs
And started playin' with words
The money wasn't right, so I had to stay on the curb
An' I'll be a playa later,
But for now call me pudae Kiss
If not that, montaga Jada
I kick hard bars and blow hard weed
And be everywhere cause' I ove at gods speed
An' my aim is to make y'all bleed
Y'all got embarrassed in the class when the teacher used to make y'all read,
Uh-huh, mid over matter,
An' that's all good but fuck that, my new shit is spine over bladder
An' everybody tryin' to get to the top, an' that's all good to but right now I'm on the ladder.
Look at you then (then, Uh-Huh)
Look at you now (Ya)
Don't let this cold cold world (uh-uh-uh)
Bring you down.
Verse 2 Jadakiss (Rapping)
I know your queen got here eyes on me, I got my eyes on your queen
The SMG is Heiniken green bad thing
Is you know before we goin' get it on
My kit cost 30 and 10 to put it on
No tint windows clean heavy windex
Gears on the steerin wheal I shift em' wit' my index
Real life, its just in another form
Kiss of death, its about to be another storm
I'm a god-damn ragin' bull
Stay outta jail by jus' tellin' myself the cage if full
Got niggas on the payroll just to squeeze,
You're in no position to challenge my expertise
They got I bonus if the leave you,
Old school, form the era of 45' with the penny on the needle
Boss of the bosses
So please don't violate or cross him
Or you'll be the corpse of the corpses
Verse 3 JadaKiss (rapping)
Uh, Ya know the word anger
Is just one letter short of the word danger
An' I ain't no stranger
Never use a gat more than once if you don't clean it
An' never say fuck somethin' if you don't mean it
An when it comes to life, the root you been usin' thus far ain't right, take the scenic
Whatever faith you got, put it in a crook,
Wanna hide somethin' form a nigger put it in a book
Trust me, this album the vapors gonna go around
If you ain't hot, you need paper to through around
Yeah, its gettin' clearer everyday,
When you wake up in the mornin' look in the mirror an' say"
2,By My Side,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"(Talking: Jadakiss)
Yeah niggas
Ahahahahaaaaa
So this is what it all boils down to huh? huh?
This is what it's come to huh? huh?
Yo poobs fuck that we back baby
Ahaaaaaaaaaaa!
I ain't ask you to fear it
Mandatory you think about it after you hear it
And it's the evils that's gonna make you have to compare it
You knoe me I swing back through and see who got hit after I air it
But it ain't about shit
Niggas mumble about my outfit, but I'm humble I keep my mouth shut
Lacing 'em well
It was destined for jason to sell
I can make you a reservation to hell
Then blow you outta the water, I'm outta your order
Me vs. any rapper is slaughter
Something like a poet and a author
The only difference is that I mix slick talk with pain and torture
One false move I'll cost ya
These lames I'll cross
Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya
I'm the author of slick talk, pain and torture [x2]
I'm a take the responsibility for bringing it back
They rapping with hostility meaning they wack
But then again I feel em
Knowning that they up against a nigga just like myself that'll kill em
Gotta spend a bucket to deal it for suede ceilings
Lotta bodies drop because of a trade feelings
What other rappers you know made it and stay dealing
Smart niggas just fell back and they saved millions
These are pedestrian bars for the civilians
Shoes is Italian, handgun brazilian
Open it up, see what kiss brought ya
Slick talk, pain and torture
One false move I'll cost ya
These lames I'll cross
Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya
I'm the author of slick talk, pain and torture [x2]
I flip words around sort of like birds and pounds
Rub shoulders in the industry with nerds and clowns
Give it to whoeva deserve the rounds
Hollow tips move organs and nerves around
Get money fuck riffen
I'm deff only cut different
I twist honeys, puff piff and
Get my insight from a OG with a good job and all that
But he love sniffing
Shit talker, playboy, british walker
Rappers be home like GOD please get him off us
After the sun shine it's gets darker
Slick talk, pain and torture
One false move I'll cost ya
These lames I'll cross
Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya
I'm the author of slick talk, pain and torture [x2]"

4,Can't Stop Me,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"(Feat. Ayanna Irish)
(Intro: Background Singer (Jadakiss))
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe (Gets even better) Baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe, can't stop me baby!
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe, baby
Ooh babe, ooh babe, can't stop me baby!
(Verse 1: Jadakiss)
Ummm hmmm yes I does that
Stays hot I ain't gotta get my buzz back
What everybody tryin' to be now I was that
They could never stop me, that's why I love rap
Been livin' the life, crazy ice
With the baddest chicks in the world maybe twice
The swag, the gear, the bread
All the whips is a year ahead I only fear the feds
Forty five on the other side of the peep hole
Head shot from point blank call it a free throw
Funny 'cause I had the +Vision+ since Coleco
Back then, still ain't reach my peak though
Louis loafers, Polo peak coat
Call me, whenever the bosses meet yo
Uh, I drove papi crazy
So the industry never 'gon stop me baby
(Chorus: Jadakiss (background singer))
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
(Verse 2: Jadakiss)
Yo! I'm a call it confidence 'cause I ain't cocky
I just know one thing they can't stop me
Whether I'm on 5th or L.A. at the swap meet
It's all good 'cause I know the gangstas got me
First things first the jars are broccoli
I treat the rap game like a large monopoly
One on one, niggas can't guard me properly
And when they double team me the odds are sloppy
I move like them eighty milograms of oxy
Send your sister back to your family knock kneed
Got too hot for the grams who got weed?
In the rap bracket he remains the top seed
Revolver holds six, quick to blow three
Audio heroin so you don't O.D.
Shooters know you, but you don't know me
The block is crazy can't stop me baby, uh!
(Chorus: Jadakiss (background singer))
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
(Verse 3: Jadakiss)
Yo, once I start, I ain't 'gon stop the squeezin
And the gauze ain't 'gon be able to stop the bleedinN
And your girl ain't 'gon be able to stop the wheezin (nah)
When she get that phone call from the doc, we even
You could not stop me, so stop believin
Ringtone rap, this is not the season
Punch lines hard enough to stop your breathin
And the ladies'll still pay a lot to see him
I'm a get rich long as I got my freedom
Usually when you get hit it's for a reason
If you in the hood, better dodge the Ds'and
Watch your Qs'and, be on your Ps' and
Thank y'all all for comin' out this evening
Havin' a good time with your liquor and treason
Even if they knock me, then continue to watch me
They still wouldn't be able to stop me
What?
(Chorus: Jadakiss (background singer))
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
You can't stop me now you can't stop me
No you can't stop me now you can't stop me
You can't stop me now you can't stop me (You, can't, stop, me baby)
(Outro: Jadakiss)
Uh, uh, uh, Neo, Da Matrix!
They can't stop me
(You, can't, stop, me baby)
I'm too strong, too strong! Way too strong
(You can't stop me baby...)
They can't stop me! Hahahaha!
Ha-HEEH! (No,.. can't stop me baby)
Heheh... yep"
5,Cartel Gathering,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"Yo, yo, yo, word to ride, nigga, yeah
Aiyyo, we four or five niggaz with furs on
Up top gated up, big tables got the reserves on
Blowin' on saxophones, the band is rough
So much ice on, looks like my wrist been cut
And we just made it back from Beijing
Seen my jeweler, told him melt the bird down to eight rings
But then the music stopped, Jada stood up
Before the speech, he had everybody raise they cups
He said, ""I been in spots where I can't even mention it""
""Don't drink the Cris', Ghost mighta pissed in it""
Romanian dude, black down, pourin' the saki
Face slumped to the side like Rocky
And Strahan came through with his bullshit ring
He said, ""Yikes"", when I pulled out my monster bling
Don't be afraid of the New York street talk
I switch gear all day, bro, like you do on your peach porch
The chairs is suede, the walls is velvet
Marquise ballroom, so live I felt it
Fat asses in fishnets, shakin' they pelvis
Playin' with they pussy, middle finger drippin', I smelt it
Poker tables, crap joints just for rap niggaz
Me and Sheek, walkin' around bitch slappin' niggaz
There go Rae, there go P
Yo Chop, whattup?
Sam Cooke writin' hand, all of my lightning, damn
Used to rob niggaz in Sam's, buy shams
For my dude's baby shoe or booster baby, rollin' with steel
Eatin' Jamaican food under the wheel
You know the deal, book somethin' then blow
Went from a O to a low, little apartment in Brookdale
Gold was my motto, lotto numbers is what?
Had it in me, rolled down coolin' with coke
That's the '90s, Chef era take over America
Bag Ugly Betty up, make her Ms. Guerrera
Pinky wench in sweaters, cortex burnin' the mic booth
Travel right past my heritage
Them old school niggaz is me
Taught me how to read, get skee'd, everybody missin' a ki
Yo, I do this with a natural movement
Catch me by the [Incomprehensible], scope on me, fuck it, I'm losin' it
Yeah, yo, I did it my way, lights off on the highway
Greek statues on both sides of the driveway
Word to the stamps on the diesel
The way these niggaz is lookin' either they got cramps or they evil
One go, we all go, D-boy fresh but hard dough
Cashmere and suede cargoes
On top of the beige Wallo's
45 government edition clippers, straight hollows
My clientele is supreme and it's proven
That I'm only built for the Link if it's Cuban
I'm a pioneer, I'm not a vet
'Last Kiss' is a French one, it's not a peck
Movin' powder, piff and a lot of wet
You're gonna die, that's a promise not a threat
Yeah, but I ain't with the chatterin'
'Cause I'd just rather splatter them
This is a cartel gatherin', what?"
6,Come and Get Me,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"Geah, make a move y'all, which part you wan' lose?
The clip is loaded, the quatro is on cruise
I'm back to work bitch, the clock off snooze
I'm tougher than leather nigga, I cannot bruise
Who wanna try a nigga?
Hard to the God, come and butterfly a nigga
(Hold that)
Ooze on out
(Uh, huh)
Weeks later bitch go and throw your shoes on out
I'm that shit that great Mario [unverified] 'bout
Clear this out, blood on the hopscotch floor
Shells in the sandbox, niggaz with big Glocks
Late night, movin' that junk like Redd Fox
Now, you don't want nothin' about me
(Nah)
You pussy, nigga come fuck with the Alkie
Weed smokin', keep the cancer piece on it
(Yeah)
Call hoes, get pussy whenever I want it
(C'mere bitch)
Mack daddy
(No)
Pimp daddy
(No)
Hammer cocked
(Yeah)
Let that go
I ain't heard shit in a long, long time
To even fuck around with either one of my rhymes
(Sheek Louch)
Niggaz still livin' off the petty ass crimes
The Hossa [unverified] hater, Lacoste gator
Levi's, hundred to the Mr. Chow waiter
What up street niggaz? Hold heat niggaz
Fuck sweet niggaz, you'll get beat niggaz
(Yeah)
Now who out there wanna fuck around with me?
You can come and get a fresh buck 50
We got guns, money, liquor, drugs
We right here until they come get me

You can come and get a fresh buck 50
We got guns, money, liquor, drugs

C'mon, yeah, ah, hah, nobody, c'mon
Yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah, yeah, uh, yo
Yo listen here, you ain't dead if your heart ain't stop
Twin 40's, you ain't gotta ask, ""Are they cocked?""
I'm so sharp I could come through and scar they block
Late night, red linin' in an R.A. drop
And I'm only tuckin' them until I shoot ya
When I pull 'em out that's when I'm fuckin' with your future
You gon' realize this is nothin' that you're used to
Get your life taken by a booster
Then we gon' hang the noose up
It's all over with
(Yeah)
All they found was his Louis scarf
With his DNA all over it
(Mm)
Who's choosin' and pickin' them
(Who?)
'Cause I'm sick of them
Not followin' the curriculum
(Yeah)
It's my shit and I'm evictin' them
(Get out)
Whoever feel like they ain't gotta leave, I'm rippin' them
Even though the love's frail, the thug's real
All you gotta do is just follow the blood trail
Much harder fightin' when the battle is uphill
Whatever the knife can't handle the slug will
Keep a good lawyer that's smart work on cases
Still gotta run from the NARCs, they gon' chase us
(Run)
In case I gotta put some artwork on faces
If we leave the game for God they gon' [unverified] us
My suggestion, is that you don't even test, son
Unless you wanna catch a fresh one
Now who out there wanna fuck around with me?
You can come and get a fresh buck 50
We got guns, money, liquor, drugs
We right here until they come get me
(I'm talkin' 'bout murder)
Now who out there wanna fuck around with me?
You can come and get a fresh buck 50
We got guns, money, liquor, drugs
We right here until they come get me

She got in her mind that, she gon' get some Fendi if I bone her
(Eh-eh) Backshot was murder from the rear
And she gave me mean top, while I blew the purple in her hair
Oh yeah, after I nutted I was a goner
And still got honey thinkin' that
""I wanna.."" automatic start on the Aston Martin
Can't beat 'Kiss cause you ain't got half the heart an'
Get you hit on the inside for half a carton
Couple of suits - dawg, we fuckin' with loot

8,Death Wish,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"Death wish, death wish, death wish, death wish
Death wish, death wish, death wish
(Verse 1: Jadakiss)
Hey yo, they must got a death wish
They was on the road to the riches back in the day
They got off on the exit, real disrespect, shit
Whenever a nigga try to fuck up your investment, it's hard to digest it
These young niggas don't want to get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on and catch a bunch of cases
These old niggas still think they livin' in the '80s
The shawties that they knew since they were babies turn crazy
The bitches still holla
At anybody lookin' like they gettin' a couple dollars
Could fuck, suck and swallow
Ain't nobody winnin' but everybody can't lose
Dirt's still there funeral home ain't move
Going in, coming out gang affiliated
You rather go back before being humiliated
A black cloud over the hood you can't escape it
Dust smokin' niggas walk around in the matrix
Loyalty is thin, the tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face when you mention a brick
Stick up kids come around, when they sense that you rich
Candles of lizm get lit, when you get hit with the fifth
Niggas they used to hoop dream is now sellin' the piff
And they still rattin' but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the tek, spit, fuck around
Get your head and your neck hit lookin' for a death wish, what?
Talkin' out your mouth, all reckless to a nigga
That you know, that'll let it off, that's a death wish
When your heart stops and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time, that's a death wish
When you see the blood, realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from, that's a death wish
When you know a nigga whole style's on some next shit
When you violate 'em, fwah, that's a death wish
(Verse 2: Lil Wayne)
(Young Money!)
Ah, I be on that way left shit
Better get right or get left shit
Better hit right or get left hit
Even if you threw the best pitch
Yes bitch, it's Weezy F. Bitch
I'm the best, bitch, muthafuck your guest list
I'll be like let's just kill 'em and get breakfast
Neck slit, next shit expect this
Every time you check this
I'm exit, I mean, excited to be your death wish
Bitch, I wear this G-shit on my heart not my necklace
And I keep the Heckler for the hecklers
And I'm from the Mecca of the reckless
With a record breaking death list
The reckless and neglectors think the elections won't affect us
I'm high above you above law, above average
Niggas snitchin', puttin' niggas in the can like a beverage
Damn, I pop at your head, fuck up your memories
I'll put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
Yeah, if you don't remember shit, you gon' remember this
I'm knockin' niggas down this year, I'm on my timber shit
Big lion growl at you niggas on that Simba shit
I be on that, 'Fuck yo clique', I kill every member shit
Cold as December shit, bang in any weather shit
And they can buy your bag with body parts sold separate
Yeah, that's a bet, bitch, like Russian roulette, bitch
Weezy, be the genie in the bottle, here's your death wish
Talkin' out your mouth, all reckless to a nigga
That you know, that'll let it off, that's a death wish
When your heart stops and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time, that's a death wish
When you see the blood, realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from, that's a death wish
When you know a nigga whole style's on some next shit
When you violate 'em, fwah, that's a death wish"
9,Feel Me (Skit),2001,Kiss Tha Game Goodbye (2001),,Jadakiss,"Uh huh...
All I want you to do is feel me...
While I take time out, to give you the real me...
Uh, uh, uh
Ayo I grew up very athletic, hard headed
Thought I knew everything, wanted to do everything
I was spoiled, stubborn, the only child
So the only thing I could do was hold it down
Now this is something that I could tell you that's no bullshit
I always been wicked with the flow since a lil kid
My first addiction, GI Joes and icies
After that it was light skinned girls and Nikes
Breeze through junior high school, then high school
Couple of semesters of college and then night school
Moms start riffin, talkin' 'bout how she can't support a grown man
So the god start flippin
Pops used to say shit, but never to me much
Was like he wasn't even there 'cause we ain't agree much
Used to be gone for whole weeks at a time
Puffin one eleven, used to roll three out a dime
Then I found myself sleepin' in late, doin' nothing
Fuckin', runnin' with the niggas that was hustlin
Shop wasn't open then, niggas was workin for a pair of Jordans
The next two weeks they was broke again
Me and K keep havin' talks of gettin' coke again
But the block was crowded we waitin for an openin
Meanwhile shit still slow we still flowin
Never stop or look back we still goin'
Bop passed the demo to Mary then she passed it to cousin
We thought it was on but it wasn't
And we can't blame nobody
Look at us now dog, we came in the game nobodies
Double R and Interscope, put that cake up
And we ain't go platinum but we made niggas wake up
Got 'em all talkin' 'bout pumpin the brick
And they only go and see papi to get somethin' to sniff
I'm 'bout to fuck the game up for real like in the World Series
Nigga that parachute down in the field
I don't rap I provide you bars
And the pain is invisible, but you can't hide the scars
So y'all never be on the level that we're on
Ability to have dope thoughts and spit heroin
I'm good just wakin' up
That's how I know I got one more chance to go and cash in and cake it up..."
10,Fuckin' or What,2001,Kiss Tha Game Goodbye (2001),,Jadakiss,"What's up ma? Is we fuckin' or what?
Haha, trying to say something tonight baby
I know everybody ask their chick this question
In the house, in the club, in the car, outside, everywhere
All my stripclub honeys is we fuckin' or what?
All my eat-pill honeys is we fuckin' or what?
All my hoodrat honeys is we fuckin' or what?
I just wanna know one thing, is we fuckin' or what?
(Jadakiss)
Ain't no need in buying a drink or holding a convo
If you ain't coming back to the condo
It's damn near 4 in the morning ain't shit to discuss
Till you ask which dick do you suck
I'm trying to fuck till it's light outside
You feel the same? Get your coat get your friends
The truck right outside
Listen ma I wanna ball out
So when I nut I expect you to suck it all out
And let my man tear your walls out
'Cause he just came home and he need pussy to fall out
I get it crump ask the fellow players
Kiss hit more hoes than they list in the yellow pages
It's never to cuff 'em share 'em right after I fuck 'em
To come clean I'm a mellow gangster
Pass a chick like a baton runner to runner
Been through a million thongs from summer to summer
So you'll never see J stressed they always say yes
Everynight dog I be bustin' a nut
I just can't stop gettin' the butt
And the only thing I ask girlfriend is we fuckin' or what?
(Jadakiss)
Look if you don't like men be out
And if it's all good and you got a girlfriend then we out
Please don't hit me with the two worse lines
How you don't be doing this or this is your first time
Listen we all grown bitch you came here on your own bitch
I leave them lawsuits alone bitch
She try to tell me she model
I told her me too you ain't saying nothing slick suck it and swallow
I just wanna hit you from the back and watch the Apollo
And if the pussys all that I might holla tomorrow
But you acting like a rabbit how you cling to the carrots
It ain't the bling it's the nigga ma get it and stash it
Caught a coy, caught a flashback check this out
Bring your girlfriend in the room shorty and lick her asscrack
And even though your toungue stuck in her butt
The only thing I wanna know is we fuckin' or what?"
11,Gettin' It In,2004,Kiss of Death (2004),,Jadakiss,"Ahhah
Shorty gettin' it in with me, uh huh
Shorty gettin' it in with me, yeah
She said I brought some friends for me but I don't know why
'Cause they ain't gettin' in with me, uh-uh
Repeat
Verse 1: Jadakiss
Yo, you know me I'm with the ghetto diva, stelleto fever
Jello shots, yellow reefur
Same rules apply, I'm back on top,
You can't drink or smoke if you not gon' pop.
See me in the popcorn drop, not gon' stop
Takin' shots of patrone, gettin' top on Yachts.
The medallions are mountin' rock on rock
The whole world wanna know when this lock gon' drop
Without a doubt she acknowledge the wealth
Since she ain't get brains I told her, let me get knowledge yourself
I told be proud of yourself and dig deep,
And try and see what you can get out of yourself
After all that, I told her to fall back
The ferarri truck parked in the back is all black
Next time, bring some friends and more 'gnac
It depends how I feel in the morn if I call back, what
Verse 2- Kanye West
I'm with this bad ethiopian chick drinkin' straight up liquer
I told her I'm niggerian that's straight up nigger
Now is it just me or do them ugs have girls feet lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhme with a name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try an treat me like I ain't famous.
My apologies are you into Astrology 'cause, um, I'm tryin' to make it to Uranus
See that's a little Don Juan game,
All across your chest like Sean Jean name
Niggers tryin' to figure out, since Kan' came
Who's the rookie of the year, me or Lebron James
They say whoa, don't get caught up in the hype.
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight.
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles fuck models
Spend money till your broke, my nigger live your life
Ahhaah!
Verse 3: jadakiss
Shorty gettin' it in with me, 600 Benz with me
She wanna spend with me
She see me roll up the bud, then thug out the club
'Cause I got my mens with me
She said she leavin' her friends for me, they ain't gettin' in with her
'Cause she gon bend for me
Her tongue spin like a rim for me, do what she can for me,
Look like a 10 for me
Now shorty is out with me using her mouth for me,
She lookin' out for me,
She said 'Kiss where you live, I said you see the bridge,
When you step on the balcony
Let's go
Ahhah!"
12,Gone Too Long,2011,I Love You (A Dedication to My Fans) (2011),,Jadakiss,"It's been too long and I can't do this baby (nah)
Said you're coming home but you've been gone too long (I'm sorry)
It's been too much (I know, I know) of the same thing baby (you right)
I can't take no more, you been gone too long
It started off asking you to pray for me
Now I'm on the phone begging you to wait for me
I've completed a lot of programs
So when I see the Board now they should have a day for me
Hear it in your voice that you're getting tired
When I ask do you Love me you getting quiet
One day at a time I'm just getting by it
When the meter runs out time get expired
This jail shit is corny, really startin' to bore me
And you gettin' fed up, on top of that you horny
Knew that it would happen, cause you couldn't assure me
Dealt with a nigga that did time way before me
You ain't look happy to see me when you saw me
You don't even write me back you just ignore me
You don't even answer the jack you just record me
Guess I been gone too long you can't support me
In the penitentiary my name ring
When I come home it's the same thing
Guess you gotta take what the game brings
Niggas change but a lot will remain wayne
Thinking about it while I sit here
Besides life ain't shit fair, I ain't heard from her this year
Guess I'll try to make it better when I get there
See I been holding you down for a minute
And it's been like forever since we did it
And the nights have been hell without You baby
And everyday I feel like I'm going crazy
Cause you told That this would be the last time
But you said the same thing last time
And I promised myself that I'm through crying
So I guess I'ma have to kiss you goodbye"
13,Grind Hard,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"Now we shinin' hard just like we wanna do
Grindin' day and night so we can kick off our shoes
And live a glamorous life, look what we made it too
We some real life bosses, got 'em lookin' at you
We grind hard, oh, to play harder, oh
We touch the stars, oh, that's what they call us, oh
We grind hard, oh, to buy the mall up, oh
We grind hard, oh, to play harder, harder
Yo, 24/7, 365
If we ain't breaking them down Then we letting them fly
No, never I, always we
I came in the game dividing the pies by three
Then we got famished so we set standards
Very similar to the ten crack commandments
Some couldn't take it, others got lost and couldn't make it
We wanted to floss but couldn't fake it
The hood embraced it, the rest is basic
No need to rush, be extra patient
The new 4 door Porsche is extra spacious
Same entourage, no extra faces
Hands down the best, no explanations
And to the top is the next destination
And there ain't no time outs
Death is the only time we gon' sign out
So we gon' grind out
Now we shinin' hard just like we wanna do
Grindin' day and night so we can kick off our shoes
And live a glamorous life, look what we made it too
We some real life bosses, got 'em lookin' at you
We grind hard, oh, to play harder, oh
We touch the stars, oh, that's what they call us, oh
We grind hard, oh, to buy the mall up, oh
We grind hard, oh, to play harder, harder
Yo, top 5 dead or alive's what they consider 'em
Soon as them things come in we get rid of 'em
More money, more problems, gotta live with 'em
Only thing they care about is what you givin' them
Not the energy that you wasted in the game
Or the tears that trickle down your face from the pain
The time your jaw cracked you wasted the cane
Had to do two shifts to make it the same
That all changed soon as you tasted the fame
And it was all worth it after you made you a name
Thanks to our Heavenly Father
We fly on the jet now instead of the charter
Leave a nice tip in the front for the gardener
Do a lot of listenin' so we stay smarter
Everybody's a hero when they get scarred up
It's my ball, check it up, y'all better guard up, let's go
Now we shinin' hard just like we wanna do
Grindin' day and night so we can kick off our shoes
And live a glamorous life, look what we made it too
We some real life bosses, got 'em lookin' at you
We grind hard, oh, to play harder, oh
We touch the stars, oh, that's what they call us, oh
We grind hard, oh, to buy the mall up, oh
We grind hard, oh, to play harder, harder
When we stepped out of the car
The whole damn world's lookin' at us
'Cause they knew what's wrong before
Now we ain't hurt no more
You can bring me the bill, I'll sign my name
Now we're flyin' private planes and such
Lookin' like a million bucks
You can't tell me nothin'
Now we shinin' hard just like we wanna do
Grindin' day and night so we can kick off our shoes
And live a glamorous life, look what we made it too
We some real life bosses, got 'em lookin' at you
We grind hard, oh, to play harder, oh
We touch the stars, oh, that's what they call us, oh
We grind hard, oh, to buy the mall up, oh
We grind hard, oh, to play harder, harder"
14,Hold You Down,2011,I Love You (A Dedication to My Fans) (2011),,Jadakiss,"I love you, haha
Ah, yeah, yo, lot of square feet shopping spress is the minimal
Talk all subliminal in love with a criminal
It's all coming back to the pot no chemicals
She can get hired on the spot no interviews
No carbs, just vitamins, minerals
Riding shotgun in the coop with the general
You go hard for the kids so I'm into you
Hold you down, that's what I'm feenin' do
No girls will ride, like you do for me baby
That's why I hold you down, that's why I hold you down
Them girls on the side ain't got what I need baby, that's why I hold you down
That's why I hold you down
Yo, cash coming rapidly, chicks coming after me
Here 'cause I wanna be not 'cause I have to be
You the one I wanna be with ma, actually
I knew you were special 'cause we hit it off naturally
Had your guards up at first now you attached to me
Gotta give you all of me, can't give you half of me
You could take your time girl, we gonna move carefully
A hot bath water, the meals you prepare for me
When nobody else was, you were always there for me
And I love myself just need you to care for me
You done more than enough, I owe you now
So it's only right that I hold you down
I say damn it I let this one get away
She's what I'm wanting and ain't no comparing to you girl
I never played with your heart, concealing games, no need for looking
'Cause there ain't none that hurt you girl
Listen, I ain't trying to play with you, I'm trying to stay with you
Y'a mean, spend forever and a day with you
Never mind them side chicks and they issues
They ain't nothing but bad luck that they wish you
It ain't about them though, it's 'bout the two of us
They can't stand to see us doing us
And I told you this is what I go through
But words can't explain it so that's why now I gotta hold you
Trust me,
You in good hands, we gonna be high, ha ha,
I love you, muah"

Yo, we gon hit something
I'm cutting the rug wit love
Or I'm on the wall pressed up against something
You should let 'em know the boss is back
So y'all niggas that went wood go get more shalack
I see bowlegs backing it in
I put it on her wit the ol' school two step, clap and a spin
Filled up her cup, slid her a dutch
You know what's happenin' then (what?) in
And all I did was having a grin
Off top let her know I ain't one of these dudes
Rhyming to lose, naw ma I'm rapping to win
Yeah! yes! They know the God be fresh
I'm on that ass blowing purple on the washing set
And even though I came wit thugs
You still might catch a few of them 'Stepping In The Name Of Love'
Uh! It's D on the Block, the Ryde is Ruff
And you wit the motherfucking Billionaire Boys Club!

Then she get dropped off, told her that the whole block pop off
She come through, take them rocks off
And therefore, wanna know, what would they stare for
They heard about the work, it's as white as your Air Force
Maybe it's the voice that the world got an ear for
Most of these rappers, I just don't care for
So I be on the honies wit the big ol' asses
Hypno and Cleako in big ol' glasses
We could do the damn thang, order the champagne
Honey's Head of the State, and I'm running the Campaign
If you coming, c'mon, if not I'm gone
Other than that, yo Pharrell, sing my song!

Hey yo, Honey got a goon thinking
That ass like that, she could have the room stinking

Blew her back out until the moon sank in

Lock me up, hold on the to key
I want you to wake up in the morning wit me
I got it bad for ya, breakfast and a cab for ya

How I feel about you
How I feel about you, yeah
How I really feel, How I really feel about you
How I feel about you
How I feel about you, yeah
He had a dream that the Feds got 'em
Woke up, went and bought every pair wit the red bottoms
Yep, your new beamer's black
If you ain't on Madison you in Niemans or Saks
At the gym of the salon, food shoppin' with your mom
Over one of your girlfriend's house sippin' wine
Why risk it, when you could come home to a Don
Leave Potsie alone and come roll with the Fonze
Gold metal feels much better than the bronze,
You don't have to say nothing I feel your response
You can get the ring and the house too, yeah
'Cause that's how I feel about you
Slats with the heels, Air Max
Nice pair of sweats and a ponytail just give me the chills
Yeah, we got our own special handshake, mwah
And she know how I like my pancakes
Off white three piece with the tan snakes
Eighty large make her ring finger stand straight
Now I could have a good time wit her
Chill wit me in the spot used to grind wit her
That's on everything I kill for her
Say what you want that's just how I feel for her
I gotta play it cool, mosaic tiles at the bottom of the pool
I got 'em 'cause of you
Washing set, you up under the dryer
Winter time, cuddled up under the fire
Still there after all that I put her through
Don't smoke but sometimes she take a pull or two
I don't know how I would feel without her
I just know how I feel about her"
18,I Tried,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"Everyday, somethin' in my way, I try
Shit ain't goin' right, I try to see the light, I try
It's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And somethin' holdin' me back
A better man, better level, better know, I try
Yeah yo, listen, I done played with the snakes in the grass
Paid for my mistakes I made in the past
Everybody ate when I came wit the cash
At least I tried to ride the wave till it crashed
Same wood on the gun handle is on the dash
All the hoods that son ran through is on smash
They can't identify you wit a mask
And the Bible will tell you nothin' is gonna last
The name of da game's survival
If you make it alive when you ride through, they make it arrival
My boo is gon' ride, you know I am gon' ride, too
Make an M everyday, I am gon' try to, let's go
Everyday, somethin' in my way, I try
Shit ain't goin' right, I try to see the light, I try
It's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And somethin' holdin' me back
A better man, better level, better know, I try
Yeah yo, I tried to tell niggas I'm willin' to blast for it
I only try to give it to niggas that ask for it
Got them things on the scale, I'm still weighin' 'em
Thought my dues was paid, I'm still payin' 'em
Couple Elanor's and the Goose I am still payin' 'em
Semi's and the fulli's know that the truth stay wit 'em
Wolves and gorillas is loose so don't play with 'em
Somethin's holdin' 'em back, nothin' that you could say to 'em
Popped champagne wit Biggie at the Palladium
Put that good hawk work in with the titaniums
Shit switch around when them heats get fired
And ya peeps just died but I least he tried, let's go
Everyday, somethin' in my way, I try
Shit ain't goin' right, I try to see the light, I try
It's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And somethin' holdin' me back
A better man, better level, better know, I try
Yeah, watch the game get tooken over
I am still on the same side of the fence, I am just lookin' over
A solider from the gravel to the grass
To the obstacles in life I traveled in the past
Whether I'm holdin' a mic or holdin' a Mac
It's like an invisible force is holdin' me back
But I ain't lettin' go of my pride
After I get the dough I slide, better know I tried, let's go
Everyday, somethin' in my way, I try
Shit ain't goin' right, I try to see the light, I try
It's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And somethin' holdin' me back
A better man, better level, better know, I try
Here come another day up on me
Put the pressure on me, here we go again, ah
I try to do what's right when life is so wrong
I want a better way, I see a better day
'Nuff wit the people said, I want a better me
God knows that I try but time won't wait for me

And everybody don't get it then some n****s get a nod
I done brung n****s shopping
Brung n****s touring
Those with high bails came home by the morning
Kept n****s with Nikes on n****s lights on
Not on no sucka shit trying to make it right for them
Then you try to show 'em shit
The average n***a don't appreciate nothing so
All that shit is over with
Entourage light up more shooters than fighters
People that's there to work stead is there to divide us
No more royalties, loyal fees
The less headaches it is
More for me
I'ma grown man
It took me a minute to figure out
My career is in my own hand
I'm going back to the way
The way I used to be
I got no love for these n****s

With no love for these n****s (naw)
'Cause they ain't got love for me yeah
Yo, as far as the industry goes
Everybody's a foe
Only a friend when they want you to flow
I done came straight off the plane into another man's session
And spit pain and ain't charge him a thing
Had to make my line of respect real thinner
Started getting real hungry
I needed a real dinner
Sin whoever you want, I'm kissing them all
Did a track with everybody except Mr. Shakur
To me a plaque ain't nothing
But some shit for the wall
And I ain't hating on the people who got 'em
I got a lot of 'em
But I don't got the money they got
So I ain't proud of 'em
I'm proud of me
Cause only I can get the guts out of me (what)
I'm going back to the way (yeah)
The way I used to be
I got no love for these n****s (naw)
'Cause they ain't got love for me (uh)
I'm going back to the way (uh-huh)
The way I used to be (yeah)
With no love for these n****s (naw)
'Cause they ain't got love for me yeah
Even though I'm strong
The bullshit still be penetrating
It ain't nothing personal y'all
I'm just ventilating
It was starting to make me tense
How I put a dent in the game
And came back to make more dents
More than one hand on the gun
Just makes more prints
The older I get
The Bible starts to make more sense
When I drive by and give you the horn
I ain't flip, I'm just handling my business
And keeping it going
Instead of pieces, I'm getting the lumps for real for real
And get a n***a ass like I did from the jump
Cause usually a problem would help
And you always gonna need somebody
But all you got is yourself that's why
I'm going back to the way
The way I used to be
I got no love for these n****s
'Cause they ain't got love for me
I'm going back to the way
The way I used to be
With no love for these n****s
'Cause they ain't got love for me yeah"

(HOOK 2X: Jadakiss and Parle)
I'm a gangsta
Yeah, motherfucker
I'm a thug
Uh, please believe
I'm a pimp girl
C'mon, let's go
And I'm a hustler, a hustler
Do it, do it, do it...
Yo, I'm a gangsta, 'cause I do gangsta shit
Matter fact from now on call me gangsta Kiss
You already know I handle my business
Slay you then your man before the first candle's finished
Feel good when I walk through the hood
Best part is, I don't gotta flow I just talk to the hood
And I do alotta readin, and only eat pasta
Shrimp fettucini, and pine a la vaca
Came here talkin' slick, all that real shit
That's why I'm somethin' to deal wit
Even though I wanted Gore to win
I can fuck with Bush though, 'cause he gon let the raw come in
Bigger the boss, bigger the picture
Bullets is bisexual, 'cause they hit niggas and bitches
In a Deville with dubs in the back on a cell phone riffin
I'm all of the above just listen
Yo, I'm a thug so I blow on weed
Get money like it grow on trees
Have all these hoes roll on E
Some of my niggas even stole on D's
Work 12 hour shifts, just gimme the word
I get 12 cowards hit, never givin' a fuck
18's on the Coupe, deuce O's on the truck
Tell P hold the hammer while I handle the dice
Shoot him in his bandanna he ain't gamblin right
I need a 360 Medina, charcoal gray
Treat my guns like my dogs, let 'em bark all day
In a three floor condo with the spiral stairs
Made it past the front desk, then the rifle's here
I'm the motherfuckin big shot, I get down
Wit a 17, 16, 10 and a six shot
Fuck with Kiss get your wig rocked
And if you're smart you'll bounce when my motherfuckin shit drop
Yo, I'm a pimp girl
Catch me at the bar with a bottle of Cuervo
Mami's rubbin my webo
And this is what got me the ass
Honey said her drink was hot so I put my watch in her glass
Then she ain't even wanna get breakfast
She just wanna hop right up in the truck and get reckless
Top from the club all the way to the exit
Ask me her name, couldn't tell you if I guessed it
My bitches don't know nothing, don't say nothing
And they pay for everything, I don't pay nothing
I'm a white tee pimp, fresh headband
Dirty denim, Timbaland, or a Nike pimp
I like to eat shrimp, and I don't keep a broad long enough to love 'em
Now dog that's some deep shit
'Cause I don't believe in hoes explorin
No matter how bad you are you gone in the mornin"

Got it so good if I'm late they'll wait for me
Mama please pray for me
The devil does things in the worst ways
In the ER waiting to hear what the nurse say
I dun' paid for more funerals than birthdays
Finish a whole one and a half by Thursday (word)
So just imagine what I'm sittin' with,
And I ain't splittin' it, I'm out here gettin' it

Organization is smooth and ran with a tight lip
Get rid of the work, hold the bread with a tight grip
Trust fund baby in the cut with a white chick
Was in a choke hold, now its in a vice grip
And even though my arm still strong with the dices
Drug dealer, I don't do jooks or heists
The fame is all right but the game is priceless
My heart beating but I'm still out here lifeless
Start off with a wish if you wanna grant shit
I was never a worker, I always ran shit (true)
They was doin' shelves, I did the stand smiths
My hair used to be nappier than Durant's shit
Where they got the work at, and how much the grams is
Build it up to a key that's what the plan is
You ain't got no fam just you and your manses
Out here taking penitentiary chances
I'm in these streets, hustlin' every day"
22,Inkredible Remix,2011,I Love You (A Dedication to My Fans) (2011),,Jadakiss,"Tray I see you, Rosay
You know what it is
(Maybach Music)
My attitude is fuck it, house big as Publix
Shopping is a pleasure, pinky ring a nugget
Niggas like the ride, sip lean out the bucket
I lean to the side, white whip Michael Douglas
Hard times, call for drastic measures
I call my dawg, he bought a Mac eleven
Forty rounds hollerin' ""where the ? at""
Nigga dead serious choppa with a shoulder strap
Microphone Micheal Corleone I know I'm wrong
The man up above love for me to sing them poems
So sing along, you know the song I sing
Bring them things along, I gotta feed the team
It's Rosay, I need a hundred bottles,
Yellow bitches, all of 'em swallow
H town, nigga three o five
I can move them packs, each and every night
Triple black Panamera, Phantom of the streets
Quarterbackin' these bricks on top of these glass cleats
All these stones from my neck and wrist part of the streets
?
I'm in the hood under surveillance, buncha haters watchin'
Couple choppas out for dinner failin' ain't an option
Reclinable seats, invisible ceilings
Competition is murder, haters I'm killing
Fuck a money machine, I don't count it I blow it
Bitch my money conceited, it look good when I trow it
I'm a asshole, therefore my temper is reckless
I'm the city of Houston, you can tell I miss Texas
The king of the streets, somewhere deep with gorillas
Behind something that's tinted, bitch you see the gorillas
These other niggas?
And when I seem 'em let's fuck 'em minus the penetration
I'm gettin' situation, I know you bitches hate it
I'm in the new Aston, the one Swiss created
Can't give you a dime, but I can get you faded
Before you become a member, you get initiated
A lot of racks, big ice heavy weapon
The hood still love me 'cause I never left 'em
I distributed, yeah, I get rid of it
It's all coming back, every bit of it
I'm territorial, it's your memorial
And don't feel bad, I'm talkin' to all of you
This is real shit, and that's nonsense
I got AK's, I got Thompson's
I got investors, I get sponsors
They scared of the crew, I'm wit monsters
And ain't nothin' for sure but we touchin' the raw
And they gotta let us in or we rushin' the door"

And I'm down for smokin' blunts to the head
My nerves is shot, my paces is short, I dump in your head
I'm the hardest nigga out you outta know it by now
I'm the nigga that they talk about goin' to Chao
And my name ring bells, my blade stay bloody
If you heard about me beefin dog I leave the most shells
The nigga to salute, the quickest to shoot
Holiday Styles, motherfucker, givin' you pound

What? Like I won't run up and break your jaw
Like they make a vest for your head to stop the 4
I'm tired of rappin', let's get the mack and send niggas on vacation
Right in front of the radio station
Motherfuckers ain't quiet till the tech go off
Arteries hitted, hawkin, they neck is shit
I'm the motherfuckin hardest
I smack the shit out of any one of your artists
Whatever the label
Y'all niggas don't want beef, y'all want meat at the table
And I don't give a fuck, Sheek'll do life in the box
Before any of y'all bitch niggas front on the LOX
What? Motherfuckers, c'mon

Yo, If I miss your head and your neck, I'll hurt your chest
If you from the streets betrayal is worse than death
And I'm known for gettin' money, not known for wildin
But I'm real I could rock both phones in the island
This is how we even the bets
I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
Everything got dubs on it, even the vets
50 close, then 50 wide, even the sets
'Cause the bullets is like calisthenics when I'm squirtin
When they start hurtin', that means they workin
Only way we comin' is hard
Industry is like jail nigga, double R's runnin' the yard, uh"

Niggas be hatin', violatin (fo sho, fuck it)
But you need to know... owww!
HOOK: E McCaine
Jada's, got a, Jada's, got a GUN
Niggas, clear out, bitches, duck and RUN
Jada's, got a, Jada's, got a GUN
Niggas, clear out, bitches, duck and RUN
And I been had one so don't forget that
357 Magnum wit no kickback
Put 'em all in your six pack for a big stack
And I never keep the money where I keep the clips at
Violatin get you one in your throat
You still datin your heat, but me and my guns elope
When I die bury me with the toast
In case I run into a little bit of drama wherever I go
And I won't hesitate, make you levitate
Hit you with the titanium, 38, and it's featherweight
Bullets like good dope how I keep 'em coming
Kill a couple niggas then everybody want 'em
Who gon' shoot and who gon' brawl
If push comes to shove everybody know, you gon' fall
And I got mine on me
The automatic or the 40 cali, or even the black glock nine on me
I got a gun wit 200 shots
I'm the reason you moved your family to a whole new other block
I got shit that could wake up the deaf
That'll knock down the door and break up the steps
Don't even bother wearin a vest
'Cause these ain't the kinda slugs that's gon' get lodged in your chest
Gotta nighttime scope that could see through the walls
So just to get shit crackin' I'ma tear up your dog
I'ma show you what's dumbin out
And you could believe whatever I shoot it's comin' off or comin' out
And don't even try runnin' out
'Cause the 44 mag'll leave your ass by another house
This is Jadakiss, I'm sprayin everything I see in my radius
The kids stay blazin' shit
Which gun is my favorite
I don't know I got 'em all from the old to the latest shit
Guns and the sneakers made Jada
The bitches and the reefer came later with the money and the haters
But I'm a humble kid
Still put the pump in your baby mother mouth make her mumble where you live
25 years no felony I'm tellin' y'all
Why you think I saved it, to blow a nigga melon off
As a young boy always carried a cap gun
Fell in love wit it first time I clapped one
Now I'm a grown man more mature and pleasant
And like hittin niggas in the jaw with the desert
And everybody got a gun, why not me
You gotta keep it on you now it's just like I.D.
And I never seen a man cry till I seen a man shot
Fuck pride, bullets is too damn hot
So if you ain't got one then you gotta run
Handle it, or tell the whole world that..."

This goes out to, all the infants
In this cold world that was born addicted
And to all the section eight kids
Just remember these four words y'all - we gon' make it
The government keep on tryin' to fool us
The system, keep on tryin' to lose us
And all we can do is keep buyin computers
And (?) all now 'fore it start goin' down
We gotta hold our head, keep our pride
Though it hurts when I see people sleep outside
Little babies with no socks on, eatin popcorn
We all know what they moms and they pops on
Out go the love when the drugs come
They never got nuttin for Christmas, and they ain't Muslim
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them

Your head to the sky... my my, my

As long as you keep - your head - your head to the sky

Uh, to my lockdown niggaz keep your head in the sky
To my shot down niggaz keep your head in the sky
I don't know if it's better to ride, or better to die
And that's why there's red in my eye
Cause people don't know what the ghetto is like
Either you make it out, or the terrible life
I don't wanna be a broke bastard
And everybody in the hood got somebody in they fam' with a coke habit
You work for minimum wage
I'ma get in the game, get shot or a bid in the cage
It's a risk I gotta take - and I'ma be the nigga
With the bricks and the stash and the biscuit outta state
And even though I'm blessed with the gift
I gotta move cause the pain and the sickness gotta wait
I go extremely hard - why let up?
And I can breathe long as I keep my head up

Your head to the sky... my my, my
You can win - you can win - if you keep your head
As long as you keep - your head - your head to the sky

Uh, uh - uh-huh, uh - uh...
Aiyyo I come from a place where it's three strikes out
And your life's on the line, so we iced out
Summertime gettin' money, three dice out
Tanktops, and jean shorts, we Niked out
Headbands, and four wheelers
Jeeps and Coupes and convos, about who know more killers
It's all wrong but it's all right
It's a small world; matter fact it's a small life
We all trip but the way to survive
Is hold your head and make sure you fall right
And it's a quite fact, that whatever goes around comes right back
It's just like that
And we tryin' to touch major paper
Everybody in the struggle it gets greater later
Never say can't, it's better to try
And you can breathe long as you keep your head in the sky

Your fanbase wanna get rid of you
Still in the hood doin' it
I don't know why I'm doin' this, we don't eve move a lot of units
But ain't no threats, don't stress me dog
You gotta let me hear somethin' to impress me dog
When I spit I put rappers in line, then smack 'em around
I got 'em all home practicin now

Buy the bar, leave drunk, shoot up the block
You might hear 'Kiss spittin', but after the show
You might hear clips spittin', we after your glow
Things'll never be the same again
When your frame get bent, link get worn, change get spent
Confiscate your whip - you think you a player?
I could confiscate your bitch, take her and slay her
If a nigga nicer than me, then Christ is here
You got somethin' in the bank? Then the dice is here
I could show you how to gamble your money, handle a gun
But be a family man and go home to your son
Light a candle where you stand, cause that's where you died
And if you heard 'Kiss spittin', then you know it was won, uh

Yo, yo
Hey yo the voice got a lot of people heated, peep it
The flow is like methadone - lot of people need it
Seen it all happen before
Feel like I'm still hustlin; cause the way I'm rappin' is raw
You could put your jewels on it
You might just see me in the lightning pickup with the 22's on it
The stakes'll cost you; understand one thing
I do great field work plus I'ma boss too
Loyalty is hard to come by
Y'all know who the streets is run by, could only be one guy
And that be who but 'Kiss, no security
The burner and some niggaz that I grew up with
And the brand new 911, fuck a dime

I'm like the Dow Jones of rap, my stocks is high
And it never was all of, so stop the lies
Mothafuckas'll blow your brains out, and watch you bleed
The same niggaz that you trust, let 'em watch your seed
You got a dead niggaz, money don't stop the greed
That's why now I gotta rock my vest, pop my 3
And whoever die first, may god forgive
The nigga who lives, sometimes you gotta handle your biz
To my niggaz when I die, keep inhalin' the lye
And come to my wake high, when your tellin' me bye
What goes around comes around, am I comin' or goin'?
All I'm tryin' to do is leave you numb, gunnin' or flowin'
I might cock-back the gauge, and start shootin' at 'cha people
I'm lookin' for the devil 'cause money's the root of evil
And 'Kiss won't be happy till my bezel look see-through
Until I flood N-Y with pediquo and diesle
Catch me with the top, off my whip
Bust my gun while it's still tucked so you could hop, off my

I run with a few parolees, all thieves, that rocks ice
Blue pacholies and rolies

'Cause the niggaz that made promises, most of them fell
If you hungry, then I got some niggaz servin' the shells
With no sauce, and they silver, only take one to kill you
It's a small world, so you better guard your secrets
And it's easy to get money, but it's hard to keep it
Never was the one that like to hound no bitch
All I do is try to keep niggaz around me rich
Screw all-a-y'all cowards, I consider you lames
Had to save my lunch money just to get in the game
That was back when I used-ta have a mean back-spin
And no mack-10, it was just bats then
U know, beat a nigga down, take his rope
Now we-a, heat a nigga down, take his coke
And you can call me if you wanna bye them thangs
I get 'em half-price 'cause papi know my name

And everything you got in your livin' room, I got in my car
'Cept for the bar

'Cause you know they say, tomorrow ain't promised today
Either bubblin' or strugglin', nuttin between
Or have a grimie nigga like me, fuckin' ya Queen
And the Kiss only do shit with niggaz I know (that's right)
And the outside nigga can't fuck up my flow (c'mon)

Kiss push the drop, rock the ice, get the hoes

Kiss got the label's tellin' niggaz not to drop
Everthing you get, you really don't expect
'Cause when you Jay to the mmwwaa, you kiss to the death

31,Knock Yourself Out,2001,Kiss Tha Game Goodbye (2001),,Jadakiss,"Uh-huh, you know where I'm takin' this
I'm takin' it right there - they leave me no choice
AOWWWWW! Uh, uh, oh
(Verse One)
She said she was a model for a year and a half
And if she took her pins out,
Then her hair would drop down to her calf
I knew her man, he was just up North
And would've got left up North, but he was the chef up North
Anyway I'm K-I-double
All I do is get dough, spit flows, try to stay out of trouble
If you ready we could move, just lose your man
Or hit the dance floor, I'll show you how to do my dance
Or I might let you play in the garden
Or sit up in that white thing and listen to the greatest of Marvin
The estate got six locations
Take so long to get to the front once I missed probation
And I hate to brag
I know ya man really wouldn't like the Beretta but he'd hate the Mag
And yeah here go a blank check, rock yourself out
But in the mean time girl - knock yourself out
Oh you modelin momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
Whatchu wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancin? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)
(Verse Two)
Now you can knock yourself out like you boxin yourself
Or you can get real freaky start poppin' yourself
And my watch got so many rocks, when you look at the time
It's sorta like you watchin yourself, uh
Front if you want, I puff a few blunts
And take a cruise in a Porsche wit the trunk in the front
She had the Jocko B'sure sandals, told her hop in
The coupe blew her mind when she couldn't find the door handles
Attitude very high maintence; check this out ma
I'm runnin' out of my patience
Don't sleep wit me? Then don't speak wit me
And neva talk bad bout niggaz that eat wit me
(Verse Three)
Aiyyo, honey know I'm waitin to leave
Keep dancin, 'cause I like how that ass shake in them capris
I'm like Big wit the murder mamis up in Belize
But I'll still fuck a chickenhead like Lil' Cease
I don't care if they model, bet they all gon' chill
First nigga to cook base on a Foreman grill
And you might win some, but you just lost one
Kiss +Miseducates+ 'em like Lauryn Hill
(Chorus) - (Fades)"
32,Lay Em Down,2011,I Love You (A Dedication to My Fans) (2011),,Jadakiss,"(I just wanna tell you that I love you)
(And I appreciate everything you've done for me thus far)
When they ask we don't play around
Load up, roll up, and then we lay 'em down
Niggas hustle on the block with them thangs round
Keep the fast cake, keep a choppa' just to lay 'em down
If he try, give that lame a lullaby
Make him touch the sky, and if he gotta we lay 'em down
Trust me, if I gotta spray the pound
I won't hesitate for one second, to lay 'em down
Another man down let me see you try to live through 'em
I had the whole town talking 'bout what you did to 'em
Funny how quickly they forget what I give to 'em
Life or dead situations I had us live through 'em
Still let the ? off
Couple more to pick off
When the drama is lit you can't cut the wick off
Streets taught him well, learnt it until it cost him
Reciprocated the hate and turned it into a fortune
Never woulda tried his hand, but they forced him
So right after they fried his man, then they off'ed him
Yeah you know the trees, the mink stop right below the knees
Four door shit from overseas
Underboss from the other side,
Blame me when you hear that they killed his whole mother's side
Never the money, always for the love of it
After you put 'em to bed, I sing 'em a lullaby
Mwah
Give that lame a lullaby, bed time story
You wouldn't die to do fed time for me
You gon' fuck around and make the headline story
Bitch in the whip, lettin' it redline for me
Fuck ? get somethin' on the freeway, sucka free
Five less than twenty for the bird, nigga fuck wit me
Three less than six for the P, get it on the arm
Organic dope, 'cause you can get it on the farm
I'm a Godfather, I'm a Don
My ? is my word, word is my?
Can't be stopped in the first, or the fourth quarter
Work coming in on the dock, now that's a boss order
Big diamonds, clear like VOS water
Payin' money to the judge fuck a court order
Do it big like Frank White
And the K'll put your brains on the floor, like it ain't right"
33,Letter to B.I.G.,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"(Intro: Jadakiss)
Uh huh! I ain't even good with writin
I don't even write shit
I just felt, I had to write this letter to BIG
Niggas is actin' like... letter to BIG
Uh, yo
(Verse One: Jadakiss)
Dear Christopher Frank White Wallace
Yeah it's your boy Kiss I just wanna holla
In your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet
Kangol on the rack, a fresh pair of Wallies
You know I'm still the liquor and the weed child
And still got Branson on speed dial
And everybody's the king now
You ain't gotta be nice gettin' shot is the thing now
Mafia was doin' there best they separated
Now Roc and Gutta doin' a stretch, uh, yeah
Kim is still in it to win it
I seen Money L awhile ago but I ain't heard from Cease in a minute
People in power is queer
I could go on for a year 'bout how it would be if you were still here
The game got cheaper, rappers is more commercially successful now
But the heart's alot weaker
You know me still got the flow that'll pop speakers
First option on offense the top feature
It's easy BIG all you need is a protool set
And I ain't touch the paper that I was supposed to yet
Everybody that's somebody show respect
Only a matter of time before they notice that
I'm an impecable lyricist
And with the right mechanics, I could take over be clear of this
They well aware of Kiss the light of the city
And I ain't on the label no more but I'm tighter with Diddy
I got my own plan handle mine like a grown man
Long as I know I'm nice, fuck it I'm my own fan
Remixed the joints you had
But, they could never ever duplicate your swag (Never)
Meanwhile I'm a keep it so on my lil' plans
And you might bump into a few of my lil' man's
Up there steppin with God
Down here Mister Cee in BK still reppin you hard
Tianna so pretty, CJ turned into a Lil' Biggie
Just a little lighter but so witty
On your born day, we get the highest
Groovy still the best with the garments, he keep me the flyest
Tonight, Patron is dead
Only right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Lim��o the head
And before I end it, I gotta say thanks
'Cause not only was your time well-spent, it was splendid (thanks)
...Miss you, my nigga
One Love (So we tried to hard to understand)
[Chorus: Faith Evans] (Jadakiss)
So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away
(That was my letter to B.I.G., nahmean?)
You were everything - you were everything
(I felt it was only right, I really smoked with them niggas)
[Bridge: Faith Evans] (Jadakiss)
So we'll just keep our heads to the sky (Drink wit 'em)
(Sat wit 'em, talked wit 'em)
'Cause we know we're gonna see you in the next lifetime (Real shit)
But it's never easy saying good-byyyyye
(See you when I get there, Biggie)
Saying - good-byyyyyyyyyyye (Love you)
(Chorus: Faith Evans)
So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away
You were everything (Why you had to go away?)
So we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away
You were everything (Ooh-hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh-hoo...)"
34,Lil Bruh,2011,I Love You (A Dedication to My Fans) (2011),,Jadakiss,"Hold your head up lil' bruh
You're not dead lil' bruh
You are brown when this world is black and white lil' bruh
I know how it sounds low lil' bruh
But you'll be all right lil' bruh
At times I know life can seem miserable
But lil' bruh you got a lot of more living to do
You gotta go get it, they ain't gonna give it to you
Just watch what you say, and watch who you deliver it to
Put something away, 'cause you'll never know when it rains
And you could never feel the love without knowing the pain
Bracelet and the pinky ring, go with the chain
These the different kind of jewels though, that go in your brain
Pray for your downfall, when you doing your thing
If something happens while you in charge then you was to blame
The less ? the better, stay fly get chedda'
Don't expect the V I or letter
When you get 'em never let up, when you fall get up
Wipe the tears off, get the blood and the sweat up
If you don't say nothing, can't be set up
Always stand tall, make sure you hold your head up
Hold your head lil' bruh (you don't stop)
You're not dead lil' bruh, no
You are brown when this world is black and white lil' bruh
(And you don't stop)
I know how it sounds lil' bruh
But you'll be all right lil' bruh
Aha, check me out
Yeah, ain't nobody gon' front you
There's money out here and you could get it if you want to
Or you can keep sitting around, saying what you're gonna do
If you don't pay attention, it's gonna come back to haunt you
Make saving one of your habits
Never keep the razors and plates under the cabinet
You can get further in life by using manners
Not only are these cellphones tapped they using scanners
Never use your own address, use your nana's
And if you ever have to pull it out, use your hammer
Yeah, white paper or dutch it
Ha, automatic or clutching
Once you put it away don't touch it
Let it come to you don't rush it
Accumulate more than enough shit
Then you get in the building and crush shit
Forget the ladies lil' bruh
(And you don't stop)
You're the greatest lil' bruh
You were made to amaze and bring change lil' bruh
It takes one to know one bruh
So here's one to grow one bruh"
35,Nasty Girl,2001,Kiss Tha Game Goodbye (2001),,Jadakiss,"(Feat. Carl Thomas)
C'mon
I need a good girl
I need a good girl
I need a good girl
Eyes all chinky
She be coming through in the new Cadillac Escalade on twinkies
Ma got a perfect face, brilliant ass
Her hands and her feet look like a mill in cash
I love when I call and she still in class
Instead of down in Bloomingdales stealing bags
And you know ya man Jada shoot through the hood
She look so good that the chickenheads can't hate her
Ever seen a dime? she a hell-a one
Still make her hop out and cop me a dutch, a vanilla one
Taught her how to murda the highway
Put her up on mean shoes like Roberto Cavale'
Even though she look real ill in the Gucci
Now you might catch her in Amilio Puchi
Since she a good girl that attend college
I don't let her give me brain I just let her give me knowledge
(Hook 2X: Carl Thomas)
She's a good, good, good, good girl
Such a real fine lady and a lucky girl
I don't want no nasty girl
I don't want no nasty girl
I'ma show you the kiss of life sorta like Sade
G-class 5, the seats go sideways
Wit the see-through roof, OOF!
Rims so big they leave dents in the highway
My good girl ride wit me
She take over the wheel every time I pull over to piss
She shake it up in the club when I'm over them hips
Waking up to the turkey bacon over the grits
Orange juice and the newspaper over the clips
Later on she gon hook up spaghetti
She ain't worried 'bout Herm S shit she got it already
She said she knew about the game cause her father was heavy
Then she asked could she borrow the Chevy
I could zoom in the jag
She going shopping need room for the bags
I sped off in the joint like it's Raspy's world
Cause (I don't want no nasty girl)
She's a good girl, I love her for that
She got mad dough, I love her for that
Her moms is cool, I think her lil' brother a rat
Everything else is straight though other than that
She don't play no games, I love her for that
Or hang wit no dames, I love her for that
I told her roll for dolo, leave the chicks
Attitude, reflex leadership
And the sex is incredible, I love her for that
How she fit me in her schedule, I love her for that
And she like making love by the lake for hours
Or just chillin' on the block, on a crate for hours
This Jadakiss, and Timbaland
This is Raspy's world
And I don't want no nasty girl"

Get shot three three different ways

(Jadakiss)
Aiyyo Swizz check it out
I'm shoot over to Cali, yknahmsayin? Check this movie out
Then I'ma check honey out
Then I'ma fly back to N.Y., see what's goin' on in the projects
Then I'ma shoot down to Atlanta
See how it's goin' down in the Dirty Dirty
Then I'ma shoot over to New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, Seattle, Miami...
(Chorus: Swizz Beatz)
I'm on my way to Cali to see my bitch (say what?)
I'm on my way to New York to see my bitch (that's right)
Down in Atlanta done seen my bitch - now
I don't know, what you've been told
But I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (say what?)
I'm on my way to Texas to see my bitch (that's right)
Down in Miami done seen my bitch - now
I don't know, what you've been told
(Jadakiss)
But I'm on my way to Cali to see my bitch
And do a movie but first I gotta read my script
After that I get it poppin' at the La Mentage
I'm gettin' skull in the Ferrari, bottom garage
Then it's back to N.Y. to my project bitch
She like to do it anywhere, a real hardhead bitch
And she enjoy riffin when I'm gone
But love when I say I'll be there in a minute, listen for the horn
(Beep beep beep) I'm down in Atlanta to see my bitch
She go to college, she model, and she got chips
Rock La Perla lingerie
Tattoo on her ass that say that this belong's to Ja'
Now I don't know, what you've been told
But 'Kiss be blowin' they mind and spendin they dough
And I'm goin' on a lil' trip, I'll be back
Anybody lookin' for me, just tell 'em that I'm
(Jadakiss)
I'm on my way to New Orleans, for one whole month
To see my shorty in Magnolia, she got gold fronts
We don't kiss; matter fact I only hit that once
But she chill and she like to smoke big fat blunts
Then I'm swingin' through Detroit to see my boo
You think you got every color mink? She got two
And she just slapped a hundred on the toy
Honey was a gangstress for real, gettin' money off the board
Then I'm hittin Chi-Town, soon as it die down
Lay up in my chick's house, break a couple pies down
Nobody can do this but 'Kiss, freeze...
... Music please (ah-hah!)
Ah, where was I? Oh yes
Off to the Valley so I gotta go West
My chick got the gold Benz and the gray Lex
I hit her with a shirt on 'cause she got fake breasts, c'mon
(Jadakiss)
That I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (yesss)
She talkin' shit on the celly like she that bitch (yesss)
And this how you know it's definitely real
When you drop the CL-6, then you knock Stephanie Mills
When I get there, she gon' show me more than some brotherly love
Top piece till I cum in her mug
I'm tryin' to leave and she givin' me hell
Told her bend over; I'ma crack that ass like the Liberty Bell
(BONG!) Now I'm on my way to Texas to see my bitch
I oughta be there by breakfast if I leave by six
And ain't nuttin stoppin' Ja'
I'ma get the puss, catch the Rockets game, then be on my way
Now I'm down in Miami to see my bitch
She got her own beauty salon, and she strip
I'm proud of the girl, backside's out of this world
The bitch perform; besides that, her lips was warm, c'mon
(Ad libs to fade)"
38,One More Step,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"Ciphers in front of The Apollo as a shorty
Now I got a clip full of hollows in the .40
Louis, Guccis, every now and then Mauris
I take too long to come back, send for me
Know how to work it, big things pop on the underground circuit
Maintain till it surface
The nerve of these peasants
Treat a rap budget like a bird how I stretch it
Think they get the message
Waters, Dutchies, lot of herb in a session
So-called tough guys, herbs with aggression
Put your thoughts all over the curb with the Wesson
What used to be superb now is depressing
Negative energy
Generated from the snakes and the centipedes
You will remember me
I just get the storm started
Cold-blooded, warm-hearted
Either way you on target
Move to the side, let the lane merge
The gun's like fried rice, who want they brain stirred?
Enter the limelight, lemon drop-top off of crime life
Always see the crew in the hindsight
Yeah!
American sedan, the shooters got Berettas in their hand
This is Mafia, veterans'll plan
Word to the tape on the brick, this is raw
I'm in the 4x4, 8 plus 8 in the clip
The hustling Harry Potter, shaking the brick
Ice in the bracelet give the Matrix a glitch
And my car's like a spaceship
Got gold in my Nike checks
Jordans got ice in the laces
Pants got a gun where the waist is
It's basic, shirt smell like herb smoke
Chirp, yo, Chirp back
Let me know who getting murked, though
Yeah, we getting money, nigga
Who getting work, though
And I got the Kush, nigga
I got the Purple, move squares
'Cause we got a hold on the circle
Kill you or hurt you, whatever's a virtue
Beat you like ya parents when you breaking your curfew
Homie, live life to the death
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Get this money, it don't matter if it's cash or check
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Big houses, cars and jewels that's wet
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
To the family, friends, whole life is set
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step, one more step
Yo, living my life, what's left of it
Don't try to go to jail but if you do make the best of it
If you crash into a bullet then it ain't no estimate
It's a money-back guarantee, my nigga
Death's a definite
This is audio crack, guess who's cheffing it
Jadakiss and SP, do this effortless
Gun play make you do whatever son say
If the Lord send you a flight, the ticket is one-way
Put that work in when you young, you get power
The money don't match the running it get sour
Still rep the hood to the death
A promise is only good if it's kept
Niggas'll kill you for less
Silence is golden, go 'head, keep dozing
The window of opportunity keeps closing
We gon' see if you really a clutch baller
A cell is small, but a casket is much smaller
Burn out 30 a set shit, 60 a Key shit
That's street shit, Jada & P shit
Lambos, hoopties, shooters and groupies
Montclair, D-Squared, Emilio Pucci
Long trips, short trips, making me nauseous
Court shit, gave them Jews money for Porsches
Made a couple mil for the small shit
We rap and keep raw, so we on some street lore-Forbes shit
Wall still spin, upgraded the floor flip
Ain't touch it, ain't see it, ain't hear about it
If it's money gone, believe we gon' care about
Send some niggas to your crib, take the air up out it
Leave some blood up in it
Listen, fam, the Lam's the color of toast
The seats is like butter in it
No hammers in the club, box cutter in it
Long money and big checks
Get popped in the chest, face, wig, neck
Tre Pound, Sig, Tec
Play the game, get a plane is ya ship wreck
Learn from the best if you ain't learn shit yet
Yeah! Muthafucka
Homie, live life to the death
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Get this money, it don't matter if it's cash or check
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Big houses, cars and jewels that's wet
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step

This is what it's come to, ha? Ha?
Playoffs, yo booms, fuck that
We back, baby
I ain't asked you to fear it
Mandatory you think about it after you hear it
And it's the evils that's gonna make you have to compare it
You know me, I swing back through and see who got hit after I air it
But it ain't about shit, niggas mumble about my outfits
But I'm humble, I keep my mouth shut
Lacin' them well, it was destined for J's in the cell
I can make you a reservation to hell
Then blow you out the water, I'm out of your order
Me verse any rapper is slaughter
Something like a poet and an author
The only difference is that I mix slick talk with pain and torture
One false move will cost ya, these lames will cross ya
Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya
I'm the author of slick talk, pain and torture
One false move will cost ya, these lames will cross ya
Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya
I'm the author of slick talk, pain and torture
Yo, I'ma take the responsibility for bringing it back
They rappin' with hostility, meanin' they whack
But then again, I feel 'em
Knowin' that they up against a nigga just like myself that'll kill 'em
I gotta spend a buck at the dealer for suede ceilings
Lotta bodies drop because of betrayed feelins'
What other rappers you know made it and stay dealin'
Smart niggas just fell back and they saved millions
These are pedestrian bars for the civilians
Shoes is Italian, handgun Brazilian
Open it up and see what Kiss brought ya
Slick talk, pain and torture
One false move will cost ya, these lames will cross ya
Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya
I'm the author of slick talk, pain and torture
One false move will cost ya, these lames will cross ya
Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya
I'm the author of slick talk, pain and torture
Yo, I flip words around, sorta like birds and pounds
Rub shoulders in the industry with nerds and clowns
Give it to whoever deserve the rounds
Hollow tips, move organs and nerves around
Get money, fuck riffin'
I'm definitely cut different, I twist honey's, puff piffin
Get my insight from an old G
With a good job and all that buddy love sniffin'
Shit talker, playboy, British walker
Rather be home like, ""God, please get 'em off us""
After the sun shine, it gets darker
Slick talk, pain and torture
One false move will cost ya, these lames will cross ya
Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya
I'm the author of slick talk, pain and torture
One false move will cost ya, these lames will cross ya

It's the J-A-D-A I got beef with the feds and the D-A
I got footage of the game press replay
I got bitches in the club all over me, ma take it easy
And y'all scared I can tell
But I'ma get Bucks like Milwaukee cause like +Sam+ I +Can-sell+
I'm that nigga y'all know that
Bang you in tha yard then slide off on the early go back
In the streets I flash the cannon like Kodak
And I spray threes so say cheese
Already told you I'm lookin' for enemies
Double R so of course it's better
I love cornrows and Farrah Fawcett feathers
It's a message in a glass bottle read the letter
Money in the bank membership Visa sweaters
And we ride or d-i-e together
Uh uh come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down
Come on put ya hands up
Nah, fuck that put ya hands down
Y'all know I got the master flow, fast or slow
You wanna know who the best is ask ya hoe
The honies don't lie they love it
And they cop for real trust me dogg the thugs will dub it
'Kiss hit you with consecutive hot shit
Therefore nobody never gon' spit like I spit
Get money just to walk through off the books
So when you mention my name shit is off the hook
Shirts is off, titties is out
And you know if I'm there, hardest niggas in the city is out
I'm in the club ice over the thermal waitin for you to try me
When the lights get low I'ma burn you
Start with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models
Gotta slay two or more, ma, is our motto
And y'all might get down with the team if y'all swallow
(Muah) Kiss the game goodbye, the game is mine
You thought wrong change ya mind
I'm the nigga that'll pop the king and scoop the queen
And take over the town with a ruthless team
New S-Type wagon, future green
Gun heavy pants saggin I'm used to cream
Who you know can make a million dollar bail on cash
Never did a day and got the jails on smash, K-I double
I move the pedico quick, and just let the manteca bubble
'Kiss been a boss, y'all just start workin
Now put ya hands up till ya arms start hurtin'
Don't put 'em down till I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard headed then find out what the shells do
Now you can put 'em down if you want
But soon as the hook come back put 'em up"

Niggaz don't be in the wrong place 'cause it's me in the right spot
I'm quite hot, y'all niggaz is quite pop

To fill a motherfuckin H-2 tank up
Getcha bank up (yeah) who you rank up
Get off his dick and get you a brick (woo!)

Get a Black Phone, rent some of Jigga's stuff
I'm like T-Dub, you wanna be dubbed (no doubt)
I was there when a lil' nigga re'd up
You ain't Willie, you just act G'd up

Tell the bartender he ain't got enough
See me in the club wit them bottles up
See me in the club wit the models, uh
Rock with me now
I'ma hit 'em hard, J to the mwah
Lil' weed on me, left the joints in the car
Cardigan, Hermes skully with the scarf
You could just look at 'em and tell that he a boss
Order what you sip on, Louis Vuitton slip on
If you can't stay in the race, you get skipped on
Over for the smooth shit, time for improvement,
Elegant wrist wear, Turion movement
Yeah there's twelve bottles to a table,
Gambling with your life playing Lotto with your label.
You always in the red but their object is to pay you
Then you wonder why I'm in the projects with the yayo
Strength's in the music, according to how you use it
But when you get addicted to something, you abuse it
Yeah we're gonna drink till the sunlight
Listen here, I don't do it unless it's done right
See me in the club wit my bottles up
Tell the bartender he ain't got enough
See me in the club wit the models, huh
Rock wit me now
Right now I'm in my prime (rock wit me now)
Always been ahead of my time (so rock wit me now)
I ain't here to tell you no lies (rock wit me now)
Top five dead or alive (rock wit me now)
Yeah I'm getting money ain't nothing new
Nah, you should see they face when I'm coming through
Bunch of weirdos lookin' corny
Started off wit blue jeans then I took it to Barney's
Keep you girl over there if you notice she horny
Shoulda left her in the crib if you notice she on me
Bars is Polish spring, flow is Dasani
Purple label that's why you ain't notice the Pony
You see the difference in the stones,
Forty cal. kick back different when it's chrome
Now I react a lil' different 'cause I'm grown,
The sour come out when the piff is all gone
Stay givin' 'em hell, keep heaven wit me
I seen the game winner rim out, that's a?
I'm in down seventh, in the new seven fifty
And all I do is pray that the Feds never get me"

(Feat. Snoop Dogg and DJ Quick)
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rollin' through the hood
Playas watch me 'cause they know I
Shine, shine, shine
Hey I know I'm shinin I'm fresh ?? bodies in the ??
Love to hate me 'cause you know I'm gonna
Shine, shine, shine
(Female Singer)
Keep doin' what you doin'
It's ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine
The party starts tonight
My friends are comin' over
I really think you fly
Tonight's the night
(Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg)
I shine like Neptune, Venus, and Mars in ya face in ya state
In and outta cars, interstate, win a date with one of my broads
But you gotta hate a bitch before she gets your dick hard
That's what shinin about and when you get the hoe
You can tear her linin out, what you whinin about
You want the presence of pimpin', I'm walkin' while limpin
And holdin' on the drink that I'm sippin, I'm flippin the script an'
I'm slidin while I'm dippin my whip in, out of traffic
It's so drastic, boombastic, this shits a hit, Jadakiss
Matter fact nephew this bitch is a classic, pass this
Ayo locie loc' let's blow some dope, better yet lets go for dough
Hoe for hoe, I'm so fa sho, and so low and sensational
You know how I do it
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rollin' through the hood

Now wuts the haps on the bottle caps I want a snow bunny
I'm rick james bitch I got fasho money and I ain't hatin' for nothin'
But it be so funny cowards be wantin see me with my eyes and nose runny
I got nails and burbs while you got pounds of curbs, and one of us got a play
Basically around the burbs I'm fittin like a lego block, you bullshittin
While I'm sittin' in an eight o drop, these suckaz tell me keep it gangsta
But they don't know, when they ain't lookin' I be doin' population control
Then I'm lookin' for a breezy with a whole lotta soul so I can have a malfunction in my warddrobe
To not the jada with the ??, it's the Jada with the fo' fifth, clutchin on the fifth
With Snoop be in the front and his ***elry shinin all through his clothes and little tigger's
In the back on the low, but I still shine though
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rollin' through the hood
Playas watch me 'cause they know I

Hey I know I'm shinin I'm fresh ?? bodies in the ??
Love to hate me 'cause you know I'm gonna

Uh ya, uh like a African diamond that's deeper than rappin' and rhymin
Success happens with timin, over here I'm doin' low with the punk
When I'm over there I'm in the low low with my unc and all the bitches
Lookin' for us but I ain't lookin' for puss, right now ma I'm lookin' for cush
And I'm strapped with the pound and ?? shoes, cackies, T shirts
Uh uh after my surrounding, air force ones, jeans, city lab
A fitted that's when I'm back in the town and don't get it confused
I'm proud to be gone, be home in a year with duffle bags out on the lawn
So much money my *****z be countin' it wrong, so many hits
I can't keep count of the songs and we still grindin, stainless still nine
And y'all still hate but we still shinin let's go
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I'm rollin' through the hood

45,Shoot Outs,2004,Kiss of Death (2004),,Jadakiss,"Let's go
(Feds in the precinct lookin' at our picture)
If rap don't work we gonna get it like Guy Fisher
(I was taught to ride with them niggas thatl die with ya)
Headed OT? Then bring some pies with ya
(Buy your man a lambo and tell him to fly with ya)
Or throw the nigga jewels and tell him to shine with ya
(I shine)
You shine
(Like smith 'n' wesson you don't wanna feel the ghost)
Or the kiss of death n'
(Tubs still lift up)
So do the sink now
(Pablo escobar shit)
Buyin a clink now
(Dead presidents shit)
Robbin the Brinks now
(100 shot tommy guns)
Hell of a stink now
J-A-D-A
('Cause the P will hollow the gun to holla at son)
Muah, I'm that nigga y'all know that
(Do it Holiday Style)
Double R is Comin' for War
On the average day we smoke about a quarter
(And everythings is bad for a nigga nowadays)
So we drink a lot of water
(Talk about you ""so rich"")
Nigga you ""so bitch""
(That your parents probably think they got a daughter)
Yeah we them boys that bring all the terror
(We persevered through all the errors)
Lay niggas down with all barettas
(Everything in the bag--chains, watches...)
...All your leathers
(So you can act funny with yourselves)
I'm in the hood with dope
(Sacks is filled twenty after twelve)
A sign of the times kitchen cook 38, 38 treys
(That remind you of dimes)
Hustlers, entreprenaurs
(Anything to do with the hood)
That's what we responsible for
(Battin you down)
Knifin you up
(Stompin your jaw)
Bail a nigga out for stealin something out on the tour
(And they makin' technology to trya nd screw niggas)
I'm good long as an old gun will kill a new nigga
(Y'all dudes with 9 lives got one life left)
And controversy sells but it ain't like death
(So pop him in the head till his brains start to fizz on him)
I ain't sell my soul to the devil, I bought his from him
(Waitin on the day they say Jesus is gonna come)
So god bless y'all niggas 'cause I'm sneezing with my gun
Ah-choo
(Bless you)
You ain't D Block or Double R nigga
(No doubt imma stretch you)
Imma shoot back 10 feet
(Imma catch you)
Real brutal shit
(Make sure I snap your neck too)
SLR or the Aston Mar'
(Lamborghini or the Porsche with the crashin bars)
Iced out
(Or wear no ice at all)
100 Gs on the dice game
(Life's a ball)
Listen up -- if you real get real estate
(We the best in the game, that ain't a real debate)
And they never had AK's peelin face
('Cause its written in the starts for us to seal your fate)
Time to skate"

Yoooo!
Uh, uh-huh, uh
Yo yo yo yo aiyyo
Never will it stop
Hanguns with double digit shots
I move work on other niggas blocks
Leave out the club wit a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward, is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower, hour
Beats is knockin', hooks is rare
Earned my spot, nobody ain't put me here
Burnt my block, I had a fiend cookin wit beer
Like the Bobby Womack of crack
Might see me in the burgandy thing, or the black on black
Matter of fact, go get ya chrome
'Cause I rather be, broke together than rich alone
Clappin em' down, backin em' down (uh)
Fuck what ever happened before, I'm what's happenin' now
(Chorus: Nas (Jada))
Now gangstas live, gangstas die
Grab ya guns, soldiers ride (show discipline nigga!)
Kill ya moms, kill ya pops, kill ya seed
Kill ya girl (Its principle nigga!)
Sell ya crack, sell ya coke
Sell ya E, sell ya smoke (you hustlin nigga!)
Grab ya nine, grab ya pound
Grab ya tec, grab ya pump (you bustin' at niggaz!, wha)
(Nas)
We bravehearted, I had bitches tryin' to poison me
Niggaz who kilt loyalty
Set me up, vested up my move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and icesticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous, and when life can just stop for pussy
Niggaz killin' over hoes, guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals, touch them they feel like they froze
Speech, totally calm, holdin' dead rappers dome in my palm
Burnin flag, plus its on the qu'ran, its on the bible
Plus America cause that every car that's drivin'
Holdin' the homeless sign you focus you know its Nas then
Prince of the globe, leave no prince of the toast
Played with Ouija boards, burned frankencense wit a ghost
I've learned, to do good plus a waste of evil
And do what it takes to keep a smile on the face of my people
I was raised by the apes in this dark creepshow, but yo
(Jadakiss)
Yo yo yo yo yo yo
Think bout when I splatter ya mask (yeah)
My niggas is happy, ya momma is sad
If ya niggas is riders, the drama will last
If ya niggas is snitch, been judgin my ass
They said I'm too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip, I'm changin the gun
The realer the beef, the longer the clip
Murder ya man's, I'm gone in the mist
Call this girl after dark so we talked the bitch
We ain't care cause the whore wasn't shit
Doll, I ain't takin' the L or waistin a shell
I bring the heat like I'm Satan itself
Fuck if you hard, fuck if you soft, long as you lost
Dick in the dirt, shit in ya drawers
Ill make ya grandmother get on the floor
Tie you up, then beat you to a pulp, say that this is a war
If'n the four, mackin a pump, actin' I dump
Throw you out the window then act like you jump"

Yo Shawty is courageous,
Going through the stages,
Of where her body is more mature,
Than her age is,
Far from the daddy's little girl type,
Can't even imagine what her world's like,
It all started off as a youngin,
Stepfather used to touch her,
And she couldn't say nothing,
The more she held in the pain,
It kept coming,
Eventually it scarred her for life as a woman,
And then he just kept touching her,
Inside that was crushing her,
I got something to discuss with her,
I'm coming with the tech,
With the ear holes and the mufflers.

Big boy toys, of course the shoe's right
See the 22's reflect from the moonlight?
Barry White or Walter Cronkite?
Couple cold words when you talk 'bout birds
You ain't talkin' 'bout green, you ain't talkin' 'bout me
Hold up, this your bitch on my caller I'd
You could tell I'm somethin' else, pussy nigga do the math
Just look at me nigga, you can't tell I got cash?
Got together so fruity, 26 inches
(Girl, ain't that Blood Raw?)
You can't tell I got bitches?
I'm a three summer soul survivor
Tell me have you ever met a nigga that's real as the bible?
You could tell I'm addicted to paper
And if it ain't my clique I'm like Maino, fuck you haters
You could tell the way I stack my money
(I'm somethin' else)
Nah, I ain't one of them dummies
(I'm somethin' else)
Tre's, nick's, dimes and twenties
(I'm somethin' else)
The way I get it in with the honeys
(I'm somethin' else)
Still representin' the block
(I'm somethin' else)
And you ain't got to tell me I'm hot
(I'm somethin' else)
I'm exactly what they not
(I'm somethin' else)
Hah
(I'm somethin' else)
Ah-hah
(I'm somethin' else)
Yo, aiyyo, any situation involvin' paper I'm all in
Pull up on your block, old school sittin' on all rims
Still keep them semis on deck in case I'm tested
And gotta do a nigga dirty, turn him to a mess quick
Chest all hangin' out, everybody screamin' out
I grew up in a house, where damn near e'rybody fiendin'
So don't ask, why I hold me the pen on my fuckin' self
If I pop through and you come back I'ma
Hit you with somethin' else
I'm somethin' else the way I come off, bars that make 'em run off
Rippin' up his back but the strap'll tear your front off
Neck slump and run through your boss, he tried to jump off
It's D-Block, we treat every town just like it's New York
(D-Block)
Cross the whole game like my verses do the track
Push the pen like a pack and let it work through the trap
(Snyp)
Get your roof cut, ace hit by shooter's that'll spray shit
And if it ain't the ruger shit'll melt you and your face split
Okay, Bully bitch
Uh, I'm somethin' else, run through niggaz like Phelps
D-Block's next generation explains itself
(D-Block)
You don't wanna fuck with Bully the don-dada
Name ring bells in the hood, a known shotter
You gets nada when it comes to my ricotta
Fresh Levi's, black V-necks and Pradas
I'm a problem for niggaz if nothin' else
Control, substitute or police, I'm somethin' else
You could tell the way I stack my money
(I'm somethin' else)
Nah, I ain't one of them dummies
(I'm somethin' else)
Tre's, nick's, dimes and twenties
(I'm somethin' else)
The way I get it in with the honeys
(I'm somethin' else)
Still representin' the block
(I'm somethin' else)
And you ain't got to tell me I'm hot

50,Still Feel Me,2004,Kiss of Death (2004),,Jadakiss,"Uh-Huh
Real life shit
Feel me
Matter fact, still feel me
(Jadakiss)
Aiyyo
Past few years
Shit got so ill, was kinda hard for the god the laugh through tears
I went through something wit mama, no drama
Something that came and went, real life Karma
My pop think his son is desertin' him, it's hurtin' him
Guess I got to be the man and sit down and work wit him
My little boy seven, he the sequel to the thugs
So I told him the money will never equal to the love
Listen, I'm grown y'all
When comes to my family, it ain't never a problem, it's only a phone call
They tend and take that and run wit it
So every other month, I be on some new phone, new number shit
The Violators stay again
Gus totaled the Beamer and broke K leg again
SHHHHHH! Let us pray again
And I ain't get enough of hangin' in the local bars yet
Had to let the thang off cross town in the projects
All these rumors and shit but I ain't get robbed yet
Bitch ass niggas ain't stop actin' like broads yet
In arm reach of a gun and a mask
Somebody clipped me for a hundred in cash
Still feel me
I hit the road and tried to get more grip
And It was cool till a muthafuckin' tour bus flip
No charges brought up
Bitch popped up wit a kid and got caught up, then I put the caught up
Now the road to the riches is takin' me longer
It ain't kill me yet so it's makin' me stronger
I don't know if it's the hate, frustration or hunger
That keep a nigga goin', rappin' for a reason
Shit don't just happen, Shit happens for a reason
I'm that dude, like it or love it
I do my thing in the hood and get right wit a budget
Ain't afraid to give my life to the public
And when you see me next time maybe we can further discuss
How my sixteens give you a visual
I know you thinkin' he ain't really sellin', how he live off residuals
But right now, the game is pitiful
And niggas is lonely, they need company 'cause they miserable
Yeah, Uh-huh
Shit is still real B
That's why I want you to still feel me"

52,Things I've Been Through,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"I just wanna thank y'all for takin' the time to listen
I appreciate that
Yo, regular TV to cable from bouncin' label to label
Just tryin' to get the horse outta the stable
Was once part of a dynasty, well, least I was tryin' to be
Think it was the time in my life when I was findin' me
Sittin' in the spot with the dimes
Willin' to do anything just to be a Bad Boy at the time
Then I rolled the dices, nah, the money didn't add up
But just that whole experience, it was priceless
No free rides to the bank
On top of that was the untimely demise of Frank B.I.
Then the 'No Way Out' tour, we was smokin' outdoor
Made eighty stacks off Cee-Lo that without tour
Videotaped it all, I still watch it now
I traveled the world, learned how to rock a crowd
It ain't much but it beats poor things that I've been through
Is all I can speak for
I can only speak for the things that I've been through
I can only speak for the things that I've been through
Now I'm on Ruff Ryder, Interscope
Same shit partnership, joint venture fifty, fifty, same split
Jimmy put the money up, two singles off of 'We Are The Streets'
Then after that seemed like he was done with us but it wasn't over yet
Styles had a plan from the jump
Which was to come out with my solo
Next thing's a little better
These the niggas that I been doin' it wit forever
Next, so I'm like whatever
The first album dropped, promotion was hella
Every stage I rocked, the performance was stella
Had the whole world ready to ride or die for me
And I wasn't platinum, I was just side money
X was bringin' in the moollah
I was in the hood in the kitchen wit the digital ruler
I can't tell you 'bout the evil men do
I can only speak for the things that I've been through
I can only speak for the things that I've been through
I can only speak for the things that I've been through
As far as the LOX, we all fine, cellar is all wine
Selfish for me to say Rocfella is all mine
'Cause it ain't, I'm just a another employee that's on line
Tryin' to get my act together and do it one more time
Twenty one guns salute with all nines
And I know it's on me to make sure that we all shine
Gotta fall back, let the weed contact your mind
Confined bullshit in any contract you sign
But if you from the streets though, it's plenty of loop holes to eat yo'
Once they let you in you're supposed to keep doe
But I can't give you the formula, I'm on it though
Expect the worst, the outcome is enormous, though
Stay humble, still keep your heat for insurance though
Things that I been through to get it weren't normal yo'
Yeah, this is what my heart beats for
Things that I've been through is all that I can speak for
I can only speak for the things that I've been through
I can only speak for the things that I've been through"
53,Time's Up,2004,Kiss of Death (2004),,Jadakiss,"(Jadakiss)
Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And... it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail cause them years'll cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggaz, or over trust them
Uh... yeah them M's is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the Tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
'Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't shake the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what
(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, play time is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground
(Jadakiss)
I know how to get my pairs off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbin your head
Know that he's sick, know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwin' them bricks
Puttin' purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwin' them nicks
That's right, homey, you can't move me
I ain't goin' nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shootin is the breeze, a bootleg uzi
I'm just waitin on a que like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just gotta feel the kid
If not rap for the fact of how real he is, what up
(Jadakiss)
Aiyo, niggaz know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just wanna rock for a century
And then chase the book with the documentary
If you, can't do nothin' other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from +Blow+, let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck ridin' the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out lookin' crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you.
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fuckin' with Jason
After I cash in, it's really no justification
Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get outta line
Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up"
54,Toast (Intro),2011,I Love You (A Dedication to My Fans) (2011),,Jadakiss,"I'd like to say a few words
Excuse me
I thank all y'all for coming out tonight
We all gathered here at this table
To celebrate the brothers we lost in the struggle
Those that fell victim to the street
All our loved ones behind the wall
And most of all, to the new up and coming cats
Paying homage, to those that paved the way
Let's toast to that,
Cheers!"

Toast to the street life, this is how we eat right?
Strip harsh Chris Bosh, gotta keep the heat tight
Toast to the connect, cheers to the cheap price
Toast to those too foul, avoidin' the three strikes
New Range the cash we took, I threw shoes on the sport
It got athlete's foot
The God flash the gems
I nicknamed your girl Kim, 'cause every time the car dash she in
Ya use to scrape the plate, Brillo
Had the head swingin' back 'n' forth, Willow
Cops tried to ban me from the court, Billo
Riley still wit his girl, but he knows
She ain't a dime, I can see that cellulite shit
Those are just dimes I can see their cellulite shit
Fred the God, Jadakiss what's close to that?
Now let's toast to that

Still squeezing the juice outta the headphones
Put your bottles in the air and make noise wit 'em
Send your girls to the rear and let my boys hit 'em
Fifty large, all hundreds, chip ahoys wit 'em
Cash, full length minks on, all the toys wit 'em
For those not here, for those still employed wit 'em
We celebratin' the times we enjoyed with them
In way, a apart of me was destroyed wit 'em
Tried talking to the Lord, I get annoyed wit 'em
Fiends take a hit and feel like Floyd hit 'em
It was never beef everything was soy wit 'em
Ex rhythm hunter, used to enjoy rhythm,
As the years went by he learned more wisdom
Always kept cigars and burned more?
We all die the object is to avoid prison
If you ain't paying respect, then you supposed to
'Cause that's really something to toast to

Watch who you around if you in between streets
And may all your ups and downs be in between the sheets
There's only two choices, the powder or the hard son
Jada the forefather and Fred the Godfather
Jadakiss top five, Fred is the future
It's about to get ugly, Madeusa
Life's still a bitch, when I spit I seduce her
Toast from the boss to the shooters

You was there when I was on the bench hurtin'
Now that I own my team
Its only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now
She carrys the money, the hammer, and material across town
And understand she fine
Understand she mine
She understand the grind
Cooks, clean, and irons
And whatever she's wanna push imma cosign
And if I ain't got it already than imma go find it ...
I guess imma lucky don, and she's a lucky queen
'Cause her jewerly box look likes lucky charms
All color stones
And she no that I'm in the hood
But she also now's that I'm coming home

And you will let me know exactly how the ladies will respond from a womens point of view
And that's why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin in the bed with a pearl long vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
The sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so its crazy ill

Get off this, fucking with X, but on some other shit
Why the fuck you fucking with X? You must be fucking with X
Go catch a chicken, fucking with me you gon' catch a whippen

When is they getting off our dicks, them niggaz is clowns
How many dogs you let go up, still getting down

Y-O motherfucker for real, yo 'Kiss tell 'em

Shoot to kill, stomp niggaz out boot to grill

Niggaz can't fuck with Kiss, I mean that
Had to stop eating red meat 'cause I ate too many Beanie-Macs
I'm not one of them niggaz and since you so richeous

Niggaz gas you to force your hand
Realistically you just a worker and your boss is my man"

We got water, (X, haze)
Plus weight in the D
And I'm tired of hearin about old niggas that had it
And be the same old niggas that ratted
(Who cares?) Talkin' 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back
(SP)
Gun works official but niggas don't be wantin that
(Why?) 'Cause they puss and they man's is lame
(JK)
We so for real in the hood we make candy rain
(SP)
I could easily send you to God
(JK)
But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
If you can't remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver it hard...
(JK)
Ja- da- mwa, I'll kiss you you bitch ass nigga
That the hood won't miss you you bitch ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean
(SP)
He be aight though
(JK)
You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it till you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the eight and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
'Cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer I manufacture crack
And, niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eatin right, gettin' good rest either on the far or the foam
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
Sound anything like Kiss then sign right here
And, y'all just talkin', I'm doin' it well
Jadakiss motherfucker I'ma see you in hell, what"

(Chorus - Eminem)
Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams
With things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers,
Pin handlers Hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun don't shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
'Cause every cities got a ghetto and every ghetto got a hood
Take a good look around you 'cause there's a D-Block near you
(Jadakiss)
Place where ain't no body that proud, it's a fuckin' black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Workin around though, see if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
Wild men is flappin the whole town though
Lot is assumin a niggaz salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beatin' a body is a technicality
Other than that catch 'em and clinton on a gallery
The determination and dedication of disipline
Listenin and catchin the ***els you was missin'
And they still doin' coward shit
You know the haters gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Somethin' in the air but the older they get,
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick,
We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say I'm exquisite,
Anytime you can pay us a visit
(Chorus - Eminem)
Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams

Welcome to D-Block, the might mighty D-Block
A place in New York City where Diddy won't even walk
Its D-Block, the part of yonder where I wouldn't be caught
Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
D-Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walkin',
Stick up kids every block who walks with that free op-
-Portunity, as soon as you leave out that ***elry shop
And you won't even notice your mind will be so preo-
-Ccupied on that new watch you just copped
You wont even see that ride pull up along side you
You'll be shot fore you even realize you were spied over three blocks
D-Block the place where gees get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked
You don't even see cops, hiphop police don't even stop,
On D-Block, where everybody wants to be Pac
And you can get popped over the new G-Unit reboks
(Chorus - Eminem)
Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams

If you bust and your gun got niggaz on the run
And you rep where you from nigga you D-Block
And you try to come home and your pockets is light as a cup
They don't give a fuck, you D-Block

Homies been a monster, but its worst now that my son been born
And every ***** where I be, I put in work for free,
It's D-Block muthafucka, here grab this P
(Styles P)
Welcome to D Block, a place where lil niggaz is killaz,
And the mother's raisin a son That turns into Gorillaz,
And the hallways is pissy as hell, all we do is get bigger
More ignorant, you send us to jail, my niggaz shoot anything that'll move
Sell drugs, from the rise to the sun to the fall of the moon,
I'd die the way I stand With my man if I can when the shells come,
This is D-Block y'all welcome
(Chorus - Eminem)
Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams

60,What If,2009,The Last Kiss (2009),,Jadakiss,"(Verse 1 - Jadakiss)
Take a second, what if we could rewind the hood?
Better yet, what if the L.O.X. woulda signed with Suge?
What if Puffy never signed us?
What if Oprah made them comments like Imus?
What if you designed this?
Thought like I did
Said it like this
What if Peyton was fightin' dogs instead of Mike Vick?
What if Arnold woulda just let Tookie give life?
What if B.I.G. missed the party?
What if 'Pac missed the fight?
What if you was caged in?
What would you change then?
What if there was no Rocafella law for made men?
What if hate ran through me?
And what if Portland
Would've drafted Jordan instead of Sam Bowie?
What if you really had to be nice to get a deal?
What if all of these rappers' ice was really real?
What if I hit you with the razor from cheek to chin?
What if Mike Jackson never would have bleached his skin?
(Chorus X2 - Jadakiss)
What if you never knew things that you needed to know?
What if you never been places you needed to go?
What if you get there, and learned them as you go?
What if is the question, can I ask then once more?
(Verse 2 - Jadakiss)
What if the pain went away?
What if you changed in a day?
What if you can eliminate all the games people play?
What if Shyne beat the case?
What if Diddy did a dime flat?
What if Nelson Mandela could give his time back?
What if Malcolm was silent?
What if Martin was violent?
What if you could really sneak a Uzi on the island?
Yeah
What if I made you kiss the nina?
What if a brick was only just a misdemeanor?
What if Manhattan was hit by Hurricane Katrina?
What if a black man was the one controlling FEMA?
What if we ain't never let emotions come between us?
What if the last time we rode, somebody seen us?
What if...
(Verse 3 - Nas)
I flow calm, but don't push
What if Saddam hung Bush?
What if One Mic was called One Hook?
What if the bridge never showed me how to hold a weapon?
What if I ran up in that sick chick with no protection?
What if I never wore that army jacket?
Carhartt to match it
Unlaced Timbs, the hood on my first album cover under plastic
What if I was another corny rapper?
What if I went instead of Notorious, who would tell my story after?
What I loved less and lust more?
If Obama was on Mount Rushmore?
Would Ali give Tyson a busted jaw?
What if I never glared out the project window?
Whenever scared for me and the life of my kinfolk?
What if that gun pin broke?
I would have never leaned back in an Enzo
All red
What if real niggas was all dead?
What if Hiliary and them were reptilian?
And 20-12 was the end of men, and all world civilians?"
61,What You Ride For?,2001,Kiss Tha Game Goodbye (2001),,Jadakiss,"(Fiend) WHOMP! WHOMP!

What you ride for? What you die for? BOUNCE!
I got some bitches that'll ride for me, die for me (WHOMP! WHOMP!)
(Fiend)
Cornbread by the ki, the language when you call on a G
Prices cut (?) when you ballin on me
Sleepy I'll fuck all over your jones, holla at my cousin for zones
He don't communicate with Fiend unless you're buildin a home
Hustler kill on his momma, before he short me
Shoot him in his heart then go take it to heart, see gon' mob me (?)
Ghetto red hot, seventeen ward block
Yes I issue more shit for you to cop, then store it by the docks
Hide the fun if you can't afford cops
So ain't no tellin' where your boy rots
I employ Rotts that be wildin off the rocks
Speak in fives - like gimme what you got
And still pop a nigga ass from the rooftop
And still catch the 'Kiss performance later with The L.O.X.
We real raw - my dog collar signin with the R and R
Fuck with me you blow up with your car, (?)
(Yung Wun)
How come I don't stop in this
You wanna ride get in and get gone, gotta get my thug on
You wanna war? Okay... all right... bring it on
Touch me, you ashes (boy) I'ma leave you gaseous (uh-huh)
I'm a ghetto bastard if I want it let me have it (woo!)
You play the game raw, I make a fuckin' mess (BLAOW!)
You play thug in the streets I'm wavin at your chest (nigga)
You heard about me boy, you don't want no drama
I make it hard for you to breathe in the streets
While finessin your baby momma - get your mind right shawty
While you poppin' that X, I'ma pop yo' chest
And leave you dead in the party like soakin wet
That's what happens when you flex
In the A-T-L shawty don't be caught in the hype
I make two phone calls from a pay phone and there go your life
(Eightball)
Yeah
I, lock shit like a, big pimp nigga
Eight mackin with no, fake shit nigga
Coast to coast tossin hoes with my clique nigga
Stick my clip in, and do a hit for 'Kiss nigga
Dirty money - the only way for this nigga
Hustle after hustle - tryin' to be a rich nigga
If I get caught up, I'll never be a snitch nigga
We pimpin' hard charge it all to a bitch nigga
Under my denim is a big fo'-fifth nigga
Fuckin' with me is like, jumpin' off a cliff nigga
And I don't practice I was born with this gift nigga
Pure pimpin' from my brain to my lips nigga
Sticky green takes my mind on a trip nigga
In A-T-L I get my Gucci down at Phipps nigga
We call 'em slabs in New York they call 'em whips nigga
One hundred baby - Eightball gotta dip nigga
(Jadakiss)
Uh, uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh - yo when I'm loadin the clips, niggaz I hate, face be on 'em
That's why I stopped coppin the guns with safeties on 'em
When I touch down, call me up, I'm on the porch
With the mac, servin' niggaz ""Eightballs"" and up
You wanna know why niggaz is broke, because they hate money
The rims that I'm sittin' on is in they late twenties
Bitches wanna see me holla at 'em, throw a dollar at 'em and
If they hustle throw some hard or some powder at 'em
This is for my South niggaz
Gold and platinum ice in they mouth niggaz
Let's ride out niggaz
Everybody gon' follow the bitches
Until they realize, bullets gon' follow the stitches
On the other hand, shit is real low, it's a fact that
Nine out of ten niggaz mouths get 'em killed though
What you ride for? What you die for?
'Cause I got some niggaz and some bitches that's my word that I kill for"

Go get yourself a drink lets all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' lets blow this pound
Naw somethin' jump off we gonna hold us down

Uh me 'n' honey on the dance floor just flexin
Till the neck on my white T start stretchin
Liquor comin' outta our paws and we sweatin
But that ain't slowin us down, we still steppin
Her gear is strong, her hair is long, her feet is small
And she smoke weed and all, so we gonna pop us a bottle
And blow a good splif, VIP is crowded but they all look stiff
I'm well connected, I got wolves over there, and *****z that
Act like pitbulls over here, ya I'm just doin' my 1 2 and shit
She's shakin it, doin' that Saint Louis shit with her back in it
So I put my bones in it, the rollz go prezzy, got the pink stones in it
Why you want drama with me, I ain't gonna blast you
Before I put the money on ya head I'ma ask you *****

For me to get your wifey up out of a Von Dutch
As far as the funeral, you got it, its on us 'cause *****z ain't crazy
They just armed us uh, so let me get another round

Then its time for the gangstas so get the rubbers now
K I two of them swirled things one more drink and ya boy
Might be doin' the earl thing, ma it's me, you and whoever ya girl bring
Meet me in the back, I'm outside the pearl thing

Go get yourself a drink lets all get down
Roll somethin', smoke somethin' lets blow this pound
Naw somethin' jump off we gonna hold us down

Can't knock a ***** that didn't make it, if you try
Far as me though, my spot is celitified so when I hit my number
I'ma hit it high and when I'm dead and gone, they gonna say I did it live
'Cause I done been too nice for way to long, they can't hold me back I'm way to strong
Double R D-Block that's what it is and that's what it's gonna be
We gettin' it on I just wanna know

Real gon' recognize real, phony gon recognize steel
I reckon I will 'xpose those who are, if you ain't what you are
I don't gon' too far, sorry, muah
Get yourself a fresh flesh or a new scar
Bullet holes on the side of your new car
Load up the AR, spray yo, kayo

Aha
It's dat real
Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in dept
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if there part of your set
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death
Yeah, and why they gon give you life for a murder
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin' down
Why they sellin' niggaz CD's for under a dime
If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine
Why my niggaz ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That ain't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill Tupac 'n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Crist'
Why them bullets have to hit that door
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw
Why he kiss that whore
Why
(Chorus: Anthony Hamilton)
All that I been givin'
Is this thing that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why, oh why
Why they do me like that

Why would niggaz push pounds and powder
Why did bush knock down the towers
Why you around them cowards
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail
Why they stop lettin' niggaz get degreez in jail
Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time
And why do niggaz lie in eighty-five percent of they rhymes
Why a nigga always want what he can't have
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Even though it's almost over
Why niggaz can't get no jobs
Why they come up wit the witness protection
Why they let the terminator win the election
Come on, pay attention
Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least
(Jadakiss)
Uh, yeah, yo
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it
Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch
Why rap, 'cause I need air time
Why be on the curb wit a why lie I need a beer sign
Why all the young niggaz is dyin'
'Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for aids
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days
Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York
Why you forcin' you to be hard
Why ain't you a thug by choice
Why the whole world love my voice
Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties
'Cause I got all my old ones
That's why"
