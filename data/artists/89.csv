0,A Toast To The Good Life,2009,Loso's Way (2009),,Fabolous,"A toast to Mr. Tagalucci
And zippin open Louis duffle bags of lootchie
Braggin loosely 'bout baggin hoochies
No logo's on the clothes but the tags say Gucci (nice)
And everybody raise your glasses
The beautiful tits, and amazing asses
Bring cigar cutters and the trace of ashes
To money burials, hideaways, and staches
Thanks to DEA's gettin' slick
They used bad tape, the charges didn't stick
The lawyers, Ebanks, Sadler
Life's a bitch and I probably coulda had her
Here's to no witnesses
And playing dumb like ""I dunno what this is""
Unforgetful that's why I keep my shit full
Along with alarm systems and pitbulls
Good food, still need seasoning
Gangsta POV, that's how we sees things
It's talked about with good reasoning
Over good steaks and sweet measlings
Yeah
Beef is just a entre
Put stacks on the boy like his name Andre
All the shootouts and the killings
Sympathy for bad guys, rooting for the villians
I put my money up, loot is in the ceiling
And two baby .9's that look cuter than some children
Cheers, blood sweat and tears
No room for emotions and fears
It's the way, nothing more to say
I make the call, we can go to war today
This is Loso's Way
Follow me into Loso's way"
1,B.K. Style,2003,"More Street Dreams, Pt. 2: The Mixtape (2003)",,Fabolous,"Yeah, Its bout to get real hard for these niggas to move man
Somebody get these niggas some wheelchairs or somethin'
Goin' to war is still a scary issue
But in my hood they train to kill wit every pistol
Like they military issue
Guess you a star if you sell a million every disc two
Catch a gun case and bounce and still they'll barely frisk you
'Cause, I proved I move the retail
Make the smoothest grooves wit female
And I remove the rules on V12's
You ain't never seen it move this smooth on sprewell's
I'm a hustler, you just a middle man to me
The way I pass the rock could make Jason Kidd a fan of me
Just cop one joint, I'm a one point somethin'
Still I'll have you at gunpoint, with one joint dumpin
So watch what you say to them crackers
Ill put a couple G's on yer head like you play for the Packers
I'm rap's Labron James, I quickly see baskets
These scrubs wouldn't make it to the Mickey-D's classics
You got some sticky weed? Pass it
If not put it out, I'm pushin it before they put it out
Wit the dash, wooded out, Shaq O'Neal footed out
Blastin a (?) get it first, before they put it out, Clue!
Yeah, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Maybe wouldn't be a million kids wit they faces on containers
If cops pursue the same way they chase us entertainers
In the hood, a few big faces and a chain a-
Get metal in ya mouth like braces and retainers
Even the young bucks be scheming on somebody change
Tryin' a sell somebody 'cain, before they even potty trained
You can smooth talk your way into a hottie brain
Have her suckin long enough to leave a nigga body drained
I wasn't taught, I learned from watchin stupid people
That'll run up shootin, in front of a group of people
I lay in a cut,"

Can you be my B A B Y?
I'll never call another lover mine
And why would I? And why should I?
When I seen a lady tonight with my good eye
That I would try and make my
(Baby, baby)
I was up in the club putting my hood high
When I saw you and I stood by
Just looking at your onion
Girl, I could cry and I could lie
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet
But only one thing could keep me off the street
And that's if you be my, B A B Y
I can be why you always be fly
And I'm from B-Stuy, just like B.I.G. was
That's how F A B does
We can sip something till we both be buzzed
In a V-dub and that's only because
Need someone to be my
(Baby)
Kind of girl you find in the club rocking those phat jeans
(Baby)
Gonna find someone to be my
(Baby)
I see some ladies tonight that should be having my
(Baby, baby)
After the baby talk, the goo goo ga ga
You like this, that, you do bla bla
Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's
It's time to do you mama
First I'ma put you on your back
And make you scream out just like I put you on the track
(Baby)
Then I'ma lay you on your side
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride
And my baby know how to start me up
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills
I ask you 'cause I know you gonna gimme it real
It won't be fake and don't we make a good couple
And won't we make a good?
(Baby)
Ooh, if I seem just a bit taken, pardon me
But you're so amazing
I just want us to do this exclusively
Say you'll be my baby
My baby's the only one I bring to the villa
That can get the bling and the scrilla
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla
And still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller
I'm watching that like the boxing match
In the ring of Manila
I wanna keep it coming like the singles of 'Thriller'
I mean if you still uh, my B A B Y
Need someone to be my
(Baby)
Kind of girl you find in the club rocking those phat jeans
(Baby)
Gonna find someone to be my
(Baby)
I see some ladies tonight that should be having my

Can you be my B A B Y?
I'll never call another lover mine

3,Baby Don't Go,2007,From Nothin' to Somethin' (2007),,Fabolous,"I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't) {y'all know what this is}
Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin' to scream about just back your Beemer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to Kima house
'Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you 'cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'ma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay
I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't)
Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne
Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin' crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man
I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't)
Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin' the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'ma do somethin', it's the undercover way
When them hatin' ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin' to perm us up
We already straight - yesss
I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't)
Fab we gon' have to make a dance to this song man!
Y'knahmean; ain't no WAY you can't dance on this
Uh, T-Pain!
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!"
4,Back to Do the Damn Thing,2008,There Is No Competition (2008),,Fabolous,"I feel like the ex champ back in the title fight
The young contenders are lookin' at me in idol light
Fresh taper, Waves lookin' tidal tight
Yeah I'm in the buildin like a corey lidal flight
I'm married to the streets, This is my recital right
I got the phantom drop dressed up bridal white
You know them doors is suicidal right
Sorta like they slit ya wrists wen I try sit ya miss
Nigga picture this, Like a kodak moment
I'm off the bullshit, Bout to go back on it
N I ain't hard to find, Bet ya lo-jack on it
Call it corn row roof, Cause it go back don't it?
I gotta get it now, Ain't no pitchin plan in rappin'
Fuck bein friends, Save me the hand dappin
Understand captain, You'll be under land nappin
If you keep thinkin' that it can't when it can happen
Ask scarface, Faster than a car chase
At ya grandma's place, Lettin A-R's waste
Sports coupe, Not too much car chase
The trunk look like Desperados guitar case
If you say a thing wrong, I won't let it string long
All I gotta do is push the button like ding-dong
I don't play the back 'n' forth game unless it's ping-pong
Mike Tyson flow, So I ain't in the ring long
Nigga you ain't King Kong, Thinkin' that you did shit
You gon have ya man sick, Someone sing his theme song
My nigga Freck plugged me in with this Beijing jon
So hot, She play Alaska with a string thong
Real delicate, I just call her china set
Fendi Fur, Gucci Gators, Guess she like designer pets
She saw a few things that get her vagina wet
SF, G4, N it's not a niners jet
But check the body drop, Baby boy shittin
But it's just sittin', So it's like I made a potty stop
It's like karate chops, We be breakin bricks down
Cocaine tour, I ben through 6 towns
Openin crack is the openin act
Heroin headliner, Stage name china
What you call dat? That's what you call a crack star
I could get the kingpin charge for these rap bars"

(Hahahaha)
Yeah, I'm a Ghetto Superstar nigga
Most niggas trying to get one chick, right?
I'm trying to get two
You know, two is always better than one, right?
Yeah...
I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone
It's 151's prone, that have you and hun's stoned
Trying the unknown
Doing things I know y'all parents wouldn't con-done
It's you, her and me; eyes too blurred to see
Speech too slurred to G
But you know ""Young'n"" would love ta
See ya upon each other, feeling on me while tongue'n each other
Wow! it's a wonderful thing
To have a pretty female under each wing
The cake can prob'ly Pollie, both of these Bobby Darlies
That take off their Rockavalis?
My job is narly from getting slobbed on Harley's
Getting smoke from the supplier, robbin' Marley
I hope this ain't tooking wrong
But ma now I wanna see how both of y'all look in thongs
I got a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by
Said a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by
I'm willing to geese 'em if they feeling a threesome
I'm pulling up in the GT before the dealers release them
I ain't with the blazay blah
'Cause I hold the record for the most Menage ' Trois and lama taje (?)
I got a bad chick on my left lap
Bad chick on my right lap
Do as I suggest, I confess
At my request they gon' get right
So when you see lipstick on both cheeks
That mean I slip dick in both freaks
They started calling me Two Time Johnny
After repeatedly leaving the club wit two damn mami's
This brother done had 'em
From close friends, the girls all know each other from Adam
I'm always this humble boo, HELL YES!
It's cool for your girlfriend to come through too
At the most it'll take an hour together
To get these girls from dancing wit each other
In to taking showers together
They know, it's a studio in Fab crib
One of y'all can rock the mic while the other one ad libs
Boo, my government is personal
But I got enough sets of twins to make Doublemint commercials
After trying X, I can only imagine what y'all be trying next
The stacks that I be splurging have girls in the back of the Excursion
Forgetting 'bout the fact that they was virgins
I don't care who you bringing wit you
Just let her know that I'm poking her while I'm fingering you
I love that thing that you do
And I know about the tongue and nipple
But I ain't know you had a ring in it too
I can tell when they came, 'cause they start spelling my name
Like F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S (oww)"

Yeah I like pussy, just not standing by me though
My man did 15, he came home grimey though
Hold his gun eh'day, still think he in '94
We missed him, but we caught up with his slimey hoe
Shooters ain't picky so it's Inny Minny Miney Moe
Catch a nigga by his toe
We don't play no games
But it sound like Call Of Duty when we let that P90 go
Chitty chitty bang bang

It's not a pretty thing so it might get ugly
It could get knifey, it might get slugly
I send the family at 'em I might get Pugsly
Might get Wednesday, Gomez, Cousin It
We on some can't find em, we run up on ya cousin shit
Always sayin' what they does and knowin' who they wasn't wit
All we tryna do is make the pieces to the puzzle fit
So we question niggas wit the gun out
The story changes, the excuses never run out
It's Summertime so we gonna make sure the heats felt
See me reach hear the clip, don't think it's a seatbelt
Think of 9mm think of .45's
I get away wit a bitch, I must let shorty drive
I tell her keep it running, honk if them people coming
I bought her a Louis bag, it's just to keep the gun in

7,Body Bag (Remix),2010,There Is No Competition 2: The Grieving Music EP (2010),,Fabolous,"Yo Fab what up nigga
Funeral Service, Killa Season, Slime Flu
Lot of shit going on
Let's get ready to go in though
(Verse 1: Cam'Ron)
Huh, I said, ice in a ceramic van?
Dammit Cam, Cam is stuntin'
Weed in a picnic basket, bastard hit the panic button
Over a piece of paper, street sweepers, meat cleavers
Deep freezer, meet your maker, place your order, we the waiters
Coke, keep the?, instigators?, keep the flavours
Main course, meat potatoes, keep your favours, see ya later
The crew?, black and grey, we the Raiders
Diamonds in my ear, please baby these are lasers, haters
Front on me? Huh, I doubt it punk
Pop the trunk, my goons, high noon, out to lunch
The D&G bag? That's where the weed stash
Keep cash, breeze past, fuck y'all, eat glass
My tank on full, ease gas
Stay on point with the white, (like who?) Steve Nash
Gun go in the waist, dun' dough, I get cake
Me and funeral Fab, front row at your wake
(Hook: Vado)
Hit 'em up, shotty blast, zipped up, body bag
Fifth tucked, then what? Bullets hit your body fast
We beatin' murderers with the same lawyer Gotti had
Tie him to a pick-up truck and watch his body drag
(Verse 2: Fabolous)
Funeral, Killa, this just got very scary
All the competitions in the cemetery buried
Jesus piece, rosary, black white canary jerry
Pardon me, it's the God in me, marry Mary
But all them long stairs/stares ain't necessary, hear me?
Cannon with me, not the one Mariah Carey carry
I'm talking sawed offs and 4 fizzys?
Fuck knocking on the door, to blow the doors off, it's more easy
I'm at the top floor of the Wardarf, for four seazzys
Nickname, never caught off the floor seazzys
Tonight they lost?, ask Walt Frazier
We had a little bet, wouldn't say a vault breaker
But watch your mouth, I'm not the best insult taker
I make them call the yellow tapers and the chalk tracers
They got names for niggas like y'all, it's called ""fakers""
They should put anthrax in your salt shakers
(Hook: Vado)
(Verse 3: Vado)
In due time let your semi spray, they kidnap my slime
On a rainy day I got them back with two 9's and 20k
Timberland boxes of plenty yay, more squares than?
Our records carry? like a Fendi case. Huuh!
Four five meetings make a long day
Rap LeBron James 23 a whole ball game
That's what we call cane, black rocks, all dames
No slaves, suit and jewels, pin stripe, ball chain. Ha!
Skinny nigga on his? shit
Benz doors go up like the arms on the Karate Kid
A cocky kid, no rappers but my pockets big
""Can I Live"" bumpin' pumpin' out my mamas crib
Burners, mayhem murders
Gangland, double black suit, white tie off Space Jams
I'm causing funeral arrangements, make plans
I'm Paid In Full, y'all ain't rich like H-Man"

I see dead people
I look in my pocket and I see dead people
I see dead people
I see dead people
I look in my pocket and I see dead people
One, two, three, body count
One, two, three, everybody count
One, two, three, body count
I check my other pocket more bodies found
(Verse 1: Fabolous)
More bodies I'm back for more bodies
The competition is a skinny bitch nobody
I'm running and I know's it
That's why I'm so snotty
You little boys sit yo ass down, no potty
(Verse 2: Fabolous)
Let's keep it a hundred
That's word to Ben Frank's
Money's what you can count on when your friends ain't
Grass green over here
Green like the kushes
I got presidents in my jeans like the Bushes
We don't chase money we chase dreams
Rub this money in your face, face cream
Doctors say I have a problem
I see nothing but the bread
Told me close my eyes ""what you see""
You know what I said!
(Verse 3: Fabolous)
And if I go make sure the family gets the cash
And at my funeral there's only 1 wish I ask
Give the haters one last chance to see me cause this they last
Turn me over one by one let them kiss my ass
I see dead people
I see dead people
Pocket full of ego, big head people
One two three body count rising
And everybody got their hand out fucking Heisman
Your boy just convinced her that she gorgeous
Must have took a couple thousand of them Georges
They call me funeral they call us [? ]
Face on point they should call us swordfish
He got a gang of money
You can't stop his drive
He in the blue six screaming out stop it five
Black out jewelry, you still see it though
I make a moviue in the club, you still see it though"

Big up to the big girls, y'all are so precious
Salty bitches tryin' to raise a nigga blood pressure
Grown little girls, do yo' mouth get any fresher?
Huh? But it ain't fresh as Loso
Monogrammed out, son, case you didn't know so
Flow so deadly, swag too murderous
Known for bein' nice, that don't mean courteous
This is nothin' new, I'm not a beginner
I get big checks like a lottery winner
Her boy dissin' ah, boy, listen ah
Kindly sent him on his way, tell the mortician hi
You better holla at your homie, holla at your dog

You kept licking your tongue at me knowing how quick that this young'n be,
To pull out his dick from his dungarees,

I've been having some deep thoughts when that L blowin'
Niggas in jail know it, when you do it, do it yourself and never tell no one
You see them shells blowin'?
I go to hell knowin' that I had them eagles sitting down like Terrell Owens
I spell evil backwards, I gotta live
If money's the root to evil then fuck it, I'm an evil bastard
You know that diesel acid when it reach the masses
I swear to God, it'll burn, turn these streets to ashes
Dope in the charger, still smoking, L's laughing
I'm coaching 'The Carter,' call me Samuel L. Jackson
Niggas been fags, funny like Sinbad
Me I'm from the hood, my life savings in a gym bag
I'm flamin' the .40, I ain't even sorry
If you with your kids, then I put your brain on your shorty
I ain't open that damn block for the fame and the glory
I was hoping to 'Jamrock's like Damien Marley
(Fabolous)
Ayo, I'm living better, second letter with a set of wings
Butter leather, hoody sweater, and some better bling
Black beretta, these niggas better not have said a thing
For the cheddar I'm not a forgetter or regret a thing
I could get her, don't have to sweat her, or to get her things
I could dead her, or feel better just to let her cling
When you met her she was better than Coretta King
Y'all lived together, she was gonna get a wedding ring
She chose me and blows me like she owes me
You knows me, I take whatever life throws me, shows me
Girls don't like boys, they like cars, money, and some of that good smoke
Kush jars of 20, tell a few good jokes
But it's far from funny when you in the hood broke
But see I understand what makes niggas underhand
So I put a hundred grand just to put you on the land
This ain't what you wanted man
(Paul Cain)
I'm a problem for every rapper breathing
On every track I'm eating
It's a fact I'ma be a factor and wrap the season
I pull my strap and squeezing
Come out with a pack of demons that'll leave the pastor bleeding
You ain't gotta ask the reason
I know it's jack or scheming,
You can see the tiger stripe J from a mile away
Yellow white and glasses geaming
Chain's so sick, I don't need a piece for it
I can hear the streets talking, I dare you to reach for it
I'm strapped, if you look closely you can see the Taurus
Hate niggas that keep talking, they usually be informants
That Brooklyn bullshit, you better believe I'm on it
You know if my team would wanted [flow], put G's up on it
But naw, I don't get along with these rapping cats
They mad my chain the same size as their platinum plaques
That's a fact, let me get mine then after that
I'm completely done with rap, you cats can have it back
(Stack Bundles)
Heaven hammering sport thoughts for the winter, summer thoughts for the winter
These long john weather fiends come in shorts in the winter
Sure it snows in the winter, hope you getting my drift
And you should hold your head back when you getting the drip
Drip, the little grip, I could cover the order
When I floss, I'm a boss, I could front you a quarter
See the cross all flooded, little stones in the border
And I just got a divorce, so I'm looking for Run's daughter
Tell the Rev that I'm dealing with some evils
The sunshine on him 'cause the coupe still a see through
Danky women, Antik Denim
His pockets gotta be nauseous, the man's keep spinnin
Trickin' on niggas, throw a lil kiddie on 'em
My niggas'll seek em, they empty out the semis on 'em
You'd rather spit on God, then go against him
They was second guessing, then Squad Up convinced 'em
(Jaz)
They can't take me in a dark gray Jag
Seats the same leather as the Mark J bag
Jaz, the kind of bitch that the Narcs may tag
'Cause I'm bringing the kind of butter like Parque had
Y'know, I ain't a hoe that'll want a nickel of herb
The street bitch need a stack that's as thick as a curb
And you might catch a chick in the 'burbs
Maybe 'cause I'm nice with the nails, and slick with the verbs
Yeah, it's Ms. Jizzaz, fizzaz to spizzaz
I'm like Better Shabizzaz, with a little pizzaz
I wasn't sworn in just to join in
Been Family since the moment that I was born in
And getting money is hereditary
That California Kush got my eyes red as cherry
These bitches waiting on their next payday
I'm in the XK8 with the body of an ex-playmate
And I'm still holding the SK straight, nigga!"
14,Can You Hear Me,2004,Real Talk (2004),,Fabolous,"Fabolous lyrics
""Can You Hear Me""
'Cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggaz laid out, Till my niggaz lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me
(Fabolous)
Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines
But at the same time we was on some different shit
'Cause you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes
And I'm your nigga so I tried to smell 'em wrong for ya
Wasn't there to take the fault for ya, But if you hear me
I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side
I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup
Pants down and dick up, Leanin with one in his head
And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up
(Fabolous)
I remember selling three bricks of raw powder
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours
He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours
On a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower
And a chain that had Christ on it, a rollie with alot of Ice on it
A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around
Its likely that he blunted
With a pretty lady in them Nikes that you wanted
It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone
He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back
And now I'm black I wouldn't put it past him
The D's would Harass him, till he finally blacked out
They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out
Shots fired till his trigger finger got tired
All the newspapers said was 'Another Nigga Dead'
And it's fucked up
(Fabolous)
You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass
Great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty
A big time dealer that's doing a state biddin
Who did more than his share of dirt in the world
Enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl
So he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle
Away from the hassle to the day that he pass through
There's some enemies he might have who may wanna blast you
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs
Convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile
And she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial
Who started going on about how he moving on
About running with them same niggaz Smitty had warned about
She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off
They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off
And it's fucked up"

Keep hittin, and shift blocks for that Cali dough
Keep gettin', my tip rocked by them Cali hoes

You might end up the reason ya homies will have to pour out a little liquor
Every stack that a draws out a little thicker

But the kid's wrapped in jewels
The kid clapped that tool
Kidnap that fool
You don't wanna wake up gettin' told that ya kid's trapped at school

To the left side of ya head, push ya mind right

Baby girl
You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litagations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitta
When the startin lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like I'm gassin ya
But it take time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin
Just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey
A little bit uptight
Wonder why he comin' home in the middle of the night
It'll be all right if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be all right c'mon
(Chorus - lil mo)
I really wanna be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go
Your the one I want in my life (want in my life)
Already got a wife (got a wife)
Can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go
(Fabolous)
You ain't ever step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while on springer
At first you were somethin' I denied
Something I would slide
Just do somethin' in the ride
But shorty
There's something that you provide
Cause the entre ain't as good without somethin' on the side
(Chrous)
(Fabolous)
Uh oh, I might be leavin' the earth soon
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
It's gonna be a clip toss if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She wont care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely
You seen what happened with mr. big and r kelly
(Lil mo)
You know I care for you
Anytime this chick is there for you
Feelings I'm'ma share wit you
Which makes it a lil mo clear for you"

I don't think you know me (No)
And I don't think I know you (No)
The way you shakin' that ass (No, no, no)
Now there's nothin' in this world that I can't get ya
I can't sweat ya, but I can't let ya
Don't get carried away, I just met ya
Or you'll get carried away on that stretcher
And you respect this gangster
When you lookin' at this big diamonds and the
Necklace, ain't ya?
Checking the 22s on the Lexus ain't ya?
Peepin' at them black air max's ain't ya?
Friends would say I'm gassin' ya
Cause there ain't enough room in the coupe for more passengers
But while they feenin' and hatin'
We be leanin' and escapin'
Sticky green circulating, what you mean are we datin'?
Shorty's, a little bit too hype
But if a nigga give her anything
It'll be the pipe, and it will be all right
Cause you know the kid will be the type
And do her like Lewinsky, beeyatch!
Homie, I don't think you know me (No)
And I don't think I know you (No)

I don't think you know me (No)
And I don't think I know you (No)
But you lookin' so good
And that's just why I can't let you go (No)
You will never step out of line and come out your face
Cause you don't want to see these guns come out the waist
It'll be weeks before your neck come out the brace
Months before the verdict come out the case
When I'm there, the hypno come out the case
Hip hop cops wait for me to come out the place
But you know whenever fellas go through
I'm in the platinum and yellow gold too
I'll always get them girls do the kinky things
When they see the size of the pinky ring
It looks like a bracelet on my finger
Wedding ring in my ear
Earrings on my neck, yeah what you expect
Nigga, I'm something like a pimp
Something about the limp
Before something like I'm pimp
I said I'm something like a pimp
Cause every thirty days I'm pulling up with something with a tint
And I know something that you don't know
Can't nobody stop my nine
Can't nobody stop my shine
Can't nobody stop my grind
And I know something that you don't know
Can't nobody stop my flow
Can't nobody stop my glow
Can't nobody stop my dough
Uh oh, you might see me in Brooklyn
My heat is on me if you ever see me in Brooklyn
'Cause I'm gonna have the top down when I go back
My bulletproof vest on under the throwback
I don't see no other platinum rappers doing good like me in the hood like me
But keep it in the stash for when they pull the rover
You heard what happened the last time they pull me over?"

And changin who I am ain't part of my plan

Now I don't know if I should hug 'em or slug 'em now
And I don't know if I should cap 'em or dap 'em now

You couldn't break me

Quickest one to barrel is jump back on the heat
Y'all don't wanna see me jump back in the streets
So be happy that I ride though slump back in the seats
Bein' broke is a joke
I never found it funny
That's why I count my blessings
As much as I count my money, nigga
(Akon)
If I'm your man
And you're man
We ain't gotta worry bout where we stand
But you cross the man
You force my hand
And changin who I am ain't part of my plan
'Cause I will not change up
(Change up, no)
I said I will not change up
(Change up, no)
(Fabolous)
Some niggas change when they get change
Funny when they get money
Switch when they get rich
Strayed when they got paid
But I stresses you to holla
'Cause they never made bullet proof vests outta dollas (street fidda didda damn)
We never change this is us every day
I call them boys up they gonna bust every day
They ride high like them cush Chevrolets
Like old wax and cane lookin' for his cousin's killas
I got a dozen killas
For niggas who doesn't feel us
I changed for a reason
But homie it wasn't scrilla
They can't say that nothing change but my clothes
Oh, I'm lyin', I do change up my hoes
I pitch game you should see the change up I throws
Ain't gotta get 'em to ring to get 'em to swing
I'm a team player
If I win then we won
They gonna put us all in the hall of fame when we done
(Akon)
If I'm your man
And you're man
We ain't gotta worry bout where we stand
But you cross the man
You force my hand
And changin who I am ain't part of my plan
'Cause I will not change up
(Change up, no)
I said I will not change up
(Change up, no)
Now I don't know if I should hug 'em or slug 'em now
And I don't know if I should cap 'em or dap 'em now
But I know that it's feeling funny now
Maybe it's 'cause I'm gettin' this money now
You see things ain't the same
I said things ain't the same
No things ain't the same
And I know I ain't changed
(Fabolous)
Money can't buy happiness
But it's a damn good down payment
I don't talk much
Feel like I'm around agents
The game ain't what it used to be
I'm the same but these lames ain't used to me
Them otha niggas
Be full of theyselves
Get money and disappear
Try and pull a Chappelle
Well, I ain't hidin I'm ridin'
I ain't duckin I'm buckin
I ain't hangin' I'm bangin'
I ain't runnin' I'm gunnin
(Akon)
If I'm your man
And you're man
We ain't gotta worry bout where we stand
But you cross the man
You force my hand
And changin who I am ain't part of my plan

19,Change You or Change Me,2003,Street Dreams (2003),,Fabolous,"You know what?
Everybody goes through some changes in life
Some poeple change for the better, some poeple change for the worse
But umm, some people need to make that change
Why would I change?
I ain't never slide down a bad pole
Even though I'm certified over plaques sold
They say I'm different 'cause I ride in a plat. Rolls
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?
I never snitch and go and hide in a rat hole
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold
No pride, I ain't that old
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm Matt Knowles
It probably don't seem like a struggle
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you
Is beggin' for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you
And goin' through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you don't ride for me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you
Why would I change?
I ain't stepped outside of Superman's phone booth
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth
I'm speaking the known truth
I ain't been living the same since I moved under the Sylvia Rhone's roof
Why would I feel like I'm a stranga
And why should I feel like I'm in danga
And I grind until I'm right
Whether it's on the streets or online tryna climb sites
I ain't blind from the limelight
I had my mind and my rhymes tight and sign when the time's right
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my .38 full
I'm playing the game like I'm supposed
Staying the same like I'm supposed
Ghetto Fab in the house! Hip-hop hustler
1 million customers and still bust at ya
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you don't ride for me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghetto-est folks
Known a few dime moves and met a few Locs
Made a few comments and said a few jokes
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then
Some have even became rivals instead of friends
Only two become liable for settlements
I grew up watchin the Bed-Stuy with some veterans
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in
They know the family bring knives and barettas in
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd
How could my head be in the clouds?
It's strange, what the fame'll do
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride for me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you
I'm the same nigga man
Same nigga, that ridin' with you
Niggas that's fuckin' with you
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like
Now they on my dick right? Haha... shit is crazy
Don't let this game change you nigga..."

Broads is watchin me they wanna leech to my trap

I teach you to rap in my Sunday School
These bitches get a one day rule
You gotta fuck be Monday, cool?
Or she gotta stroke a stick like the hun play pool
If not you gotta walk like a runway fool
Catch me in the moon shine or the sun ray jewels
If you keep sayin' your prayers maybe one day you'll...
...Be blessed like me till then keep stompin in your Air Force O-N-E-S Nikes
They should make scriptures wit my flows
I'm the young Bishop Don Juan that stripped ya for your hoes
So if I throw a dollar at ya scream Hallelujah
While I grab the neck of my robe and pop a collar to ya
Church

Now in this world that we live in, there's all kinds of pimps
You got ya playas, ya ballas, ya macs, ya gorrilla
Pimps that take what they want
Ya all-star pimps... Pimps that (?)
Pimps wit nothin' but the Gators on ya feet (Preach to 'em brother)
Nice pimps, mean pimps
I feel like the angel of God
All I gotta do is drive the Range through and nod
It's like I was put here to put layers in the air
Put squares in my ear, put squares in the chair
Put pairs in the rear
I even put 20 inch footwear in my spare
Lord knows I gotta stay on them spinners
Dis verse is like grace that you say on your dinners
Girls come wit me knowin' that they gonna be sinners
But, I'ma sense of relief
And I ain't never been a trick kinda like its against my belief
If she got it from me then I'm convinced she a thief
But they say God giveth and He taketh away
And I can do the same thing when I shake with the 'K
If a nigga make a mistake wit the pay, Goddamit
At the club I get right in
So if heaven got a ghetto I should fit right in
God loves me
(Reverend preaching)
Now just what kind of ho are you?
Are you a tough ho, or a soft ho? (That's right)
Are you a big ho, or a little ho? (Lil' teenie weenie)
A domestic ho, or an international ho?
A rich ho, or a broke ass ho?
Yeah, me momma got my name from the Baptist who made
Tha wrong moves wit the women and died for it
You make the wrong moves when you come and you try for it
New York City of God
I 'den saved some of New York's prettiest broads
I'm spittin' the gospel
I hit my apostle's wit the coke that'll heal a sick
Soon as it get in they nostrils
A Dros Trios, bring the organs on ya
A 40-Caliber'll turn ya to a organ donor
And a day or two, you'll be a morgue aroma
While I go city to city fillin the pieu's up
I ask God to forgive me while I'm fillin the Uz' up
Demons won't let me see a man fillin my shoes up
I ease 'em wit a sermon, but that ain't hard
When I'm in the Beamer before they released 'em to the Germans
You prolly got the man you love wit you
But wouldn't you rather have the Man above wit you?
Can I get an Amen
(Reverend talking)
Now some of y'all are pimps, And some of y'all are hoes
But the rest... the rest of y'all... don't think I don't know
Ya just a hater... They hate what you got
They put a black eye on on the game whenever they play
They piss in the pool, And they fart on the elevator
Then look you in the face, Like they think you did it
They hate change (They hate change)
And they hate progress
They hate me and they hate you
They hate they own momma
'Cause they think it's her fault that they ain't got shit
But I'm here to tell ya today
That if you a hater
Then you are the outter take or your own business (Amen)
And someody just put 25 dollars in the collection plate
So I'ma go up on the corner

Wind up hook on machines, livin' like peas and carrots
Ya team wanna beef, that's when I screw the muzzle on the tip
And strap the beam underneath
When I ride through, ya don't see no lid
I put snipers on the roof like Nino did
All it takes is some c-note slid
To have you on the news askin if anyone seen yo' kid
I don't scream it in a rough tone

We waitin on boats, these guys go Broadway
Ya gon make me tie a bomb under ya Benz
See how much you talk wit firearms under ya chin
No you can't take the coupe wit dishes
'Cause when I hit the highway, it always makes the troop suspicious
Please, I get my dollar from the hersey
I'm on that fly gangsta shit, I pop the collar on my jersey
You know I got the heat the way the Vanson is bendin
Same laid back flow, no dancin' or grinin'
Who else can it be spellin it at them
You have them tappin they friend like ""I'm tellin' you that's him"", stupid"
22,Computer Love,2006,Loso's Way (Rise To Power) (2006),,Fabolous,"Excuse me girl, I don't mean to bite
And I ain't trynna make a scene and nothin'
But you got a face I done seen in magazines and somethin'
Kinda Legs hat the models be seen with strugglin
Some pretty brown eyes and I seen them cuttin'
In my direction, but I mean it's nothin'
If you have another man, or have other plans
Other than, cruisin the city with this brother man
On the other hand, if you wanna get your feet rest
I take you where you goin' I just need a steet address
That got her to blush,
I told her if she not in a rush, I know this lil spot on the hush
She's like a pop up, mixed with a hot club
You can pop up and it even got grub
I ride the top dubs, that do not rub
That usually get my top scrubbed in the hot tub
But Esther, kept makin' these gestures
That niggas like me don't even impress her
So I became the aggressor, started to press her
She worked for some investor who startin to stress her
Go to school but this her last semester
She even get harassed by her college professor
She just want a nigga that'll love her right
Said she passed on the spot like ""maybe another night""
But : she ain't in no hurry to had home
From there I was in her ear, just like headphones
So I inquired, what she desired
I started askin questions, like I was wired
And I could see, that she openin up to it
It's late but I have a ate, hopin she up to it
She like ""no I had dinner already"",
""But if it's sauce at your crib I make a mean spaghetti""
Now I'm on the highway like Andre
Within a couple minutes we was back at the rest
I told her make herself at home, don't act like a guest
She said ""I know guys like you be attracting the best""
""But you don't even know me, bet not try shit""
Talkin' with that attitude, rollin' her eye shit
""You tryin' to seduce me with all this fly shit
But it ain't that easy to get up in my shit
Look, let it go course
I will use no force
Oh yeah, I forgot, I ain't got no sauce
""See, you ain't care about gettin' the food
You was more about bringin' me here, gettin' me nude
I said ""hold up babygirl, you gettin' it screwed
That might have been on my mind but I didn't be rude
She said ""I can respect that, but I don't expect that
Looked like you was tryin' somthin so I had to check that""
I told her ""Don't trip though, we can move lighter than a tiptoe
And sippin on this hennessy and hypno
She started giggelin, Now I'm figurin,
I stay on my cool shit she might let a nigga in
I throw some more Jigga and Notorious Biggie in
A lot of ass wiggelin, tetas gigglin
Then she jumped on me and reached through my monkeys
I started kissin' on her neck, grabbin her donkey
It's bout to get funky, I'm tuggin on her zipper
She jumped up and got undressed quicker than a stripper
I ain't rushed, I played with it like 20 minutes
Had my hand all up her like I left money in it
Had one of the fattest asses I seen
And was throwin' it at me after them glasses of green
I laid back in the passenger lean
I'm fastin my jeans, she hit the pipe just as fast as a fiend
Then she hopped on your boy quick
Went up, down, round and round, all on the joystick
The girl screamin like she's in labour
Hittin Mariah Noise that'll wake up the neighbors
So now I'm ready to introduce her to the backshots
The Yac got me in and out her like the crackspot
I'm hittin that exact spot with the smackshots
I don't know where she yellin' like she hit the jackpot
To make the long story short I couldn't control her ass
She came first I came last, rolled the grass
As I break the cush, I ask her for a math
She got up, grabbed her jeans bust them to her lap
Said ""you probably try every girl that'll cross your path
I said ""you trippin' again, take a sipp of the henn""
Then this lil breezy came across greasy
""F-A-Beezy, you so easy!""
Matta fact sleezy, your game so cheesy
But a bitch can't lie, the dick is off the heezy
Truthfully you pass through my block like every day
Same time, same coupe, I be on the same stoop
Watchin, knowin' that I could have you If I wanted
You see me, there's no doubt Ima be confronted
So today you finally opened your eyes
Hopin to try, to get me her open my thighs
This was a challenge for me, that wasn't hard
And I know you probably could have F****d a dozen broads
But you was my hoe tonight (me?)
And I got a nigga waitin up for me at home, so goodnight
Fab:
WOW! This bitches is crazy man (crazy, what the ****!)! This bitch gon tell me?
Listen to this shit son, this bitch gon tell me (Do you believe this shit?)
Yo, matter of fact, this shit don't even matter man
Word up man, I got the ****in pussy anyway hahaha
(She was tryin' to **** anyway, tryin' to hide the ring on her finger or sumthin, hahaha
Don't let this bitch outta town man! I'm easy, I'm easy hahaha)"

Sit on the next bus like that show on MTV,
The wings on the chain, make a nigga fly like the wings on a plane,
When you sittin' in between em',
Even when you clean em', Glistenin' when you see em'
Beemin' through the tints when I'm sittin' in the ""Phenom""'
Oops! I mean Phantom, my words got ""Tangled"" man,
But this Tiger strike, watch, make this bitch a Bengals fan,
We all know Jacob, check the shit he did,
We spent more time, ""Making The Band"" than Diddy did,
You feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse,
I'm out in DC, at the ""White and Gold House""...
Wanna convince me love, Secret Service meet me with some of that Lewinsky love,
She saw the chain, gave me brain, no strain ever since,
Now that's what I call a real ""Chain of Events""! Nigga,
Diamonds In My Damn Chain!
Diamonds In My Damn Chain!

Birds love how a brother ride, truckin it sick
I'm heard of on the southern side, I pluck through it quick

This is way before a nigga brought grey plaques in
So if I spray mac-10s, Bet you niggas lay back then

Yeah I made crack grins but ain't a damn thing funny
I keep a pocket fulla do the damn thang money
I keep it comin' with bottles of champagne dunny
So keep it bouncin' till you pull a hamstring honey
These pimps just better have a gothic for me
I got them hoes starin' like they got a problem with me
I got them boys slingin rocks in the lobby for me
I'm rich bitch, ballin just a hobby for me
(Chorus-Young Jeezy)
I got a pocket full of money and my wrist all froze
So fuck what you heard we don't love them hoes, heey

(Verse 3-Fabolous)
You waitin instead of participatin with them boys
You skatin on them 22 datins like them boys
I'm hatin' that they communicatin with them boys
I'm waitin just to send them to Satan for that shit
They see a nigga stones look sick
And I gotta stack of singles in my hand that's phone booth thick
'Cause I'm so hood rich

And even if she gotta pimp then a hoe should switch
And get ridda that shit spitta, get wit her, shit gitter
Sit wit her, hit spitter, that don't bitch chitter
My style fit wit her
I tell her you don went left now you need to go right like a switch hitta
I know them tricks bitter

So I'm in a mix with her
Fourty four six with her

Why do we make up just to break up?
Wanna be together but the world tryna take us
In different directions and ain't even tell us the choices, the blessins collected
But hold on now wait a second, caught up in my recollection
I remember that body you flexin
Baby me and you was all night sexin
Your boy put it down, didn't he?
You told me you'd never forget
First time that you let me hit, got on top of it and just rode it rode it
All night long (Ha), shoulda been all life long
Me and you cheatin', won't right no wrongs
But, with a good memory, we'll stay strong
(Let's go)
I've met alot of women in my lifetime
I still never met nuttin like you
So I'm never, said I'm never, given up the pleasure, not ever
I know, you was the only one true to me
I shoulda thugged you so much more
Cause it shows, through do everything you do for me you kept it real with your boy
Believe me, I remember them day-ays, when nothing came between me and you
We be straight up doin' our thang (Thang)
When you be next to me, we in ecstasy
I'ma love it, I'ma never leave it cause that's all we got
Keep me in your memory...
And don't forget about late nights, playing in the dark and waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and, I can see it in your eyes,
You still want it
So don't forget about us (I'm never gonna let it go...)
(MC, holla) Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know, nothing comes close to what we had, it perseveres (Yeah)
That we both can't forget it, how good we used to get it
There's only one me and you (Uh uh)
And how we used to shine, used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact, that you can't deny
So baby we just can't let, the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret, so don't forget about us

And I ride on these niggaz wit a smile on
See I'm 'bout stackin' money but when they start actin' funny
I fall back and all a man do is laugh
I'm the kinda player that ain't gotta do the draft
Buncha hits, couple plaques nigga do the math
But a nigga must be gone for gettin' his hustle on
So I had to come through and take the corner back
And I'm back wit the rubber bands on a stack
Nigga quit or take what I give on a pack
Girls still think I'm fly
Blow kiss and wink the eye
And tell me they wanna go somewhere and freak off
I tell 'em I would love to stop and take the week off
But I won't stop, and I don't stop
I listen to niggaz flippin' my lines
And be grippin' my nine
Like damn niggaz flip and only spit game
Niggaz comin' at me tryin' to get names
Niggaz lookin' like me tryin' to get fame
See first it didn't matter, and I was a little flattered

I love you like a lie
I get a rush from your touch,
Sort of like a high
I used to adore your presence but now I'm like goodbye
Used to keep it a hundred with you
What gave you the right to lie
We in two different spaces
And you done turned Gemini
Completely changed faces
You wouldn't understand even if we trade places
You'll never find another me, face it
My life ain't sweet
I don't know who told you that
My shoes, might want to tiptoe in that
Walk slow with that
I'm the same ain't changed
But the haters where the homies at
Got me like damn
Where my homies at
Fuck it, it's just me
Can't hold me back
You should bite the hand if it is you
Especially when the hand's illegal
I got you 'cause
Consider it a lesson learned
I'm guessing it was just my turn
To learn the hard way
You can't always trust the ones you love
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah mmm ah probably not
You look so familiar too
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused
You got to take the good with the bad
Love what you got, remember what you had
Always forgive but never forget
Learn from mistakes, but never regret
I feel like it's coming it just ain't never done yet
You wanna take off
Go head rev up the jet
Ain't gotta act like our passion never had met
Let's be happy apart instead of together upset
I got the least out of something I put the most into
It's fucked up when assholes are who we closest to
You remind me of somebody that I used to know
Me and that other you weren't introduced before
And I don't like that bitch
We go from back and forth
I don't like that shit
Who's gonna fill your space
That's still a case
Been French but only familiar face,
Get money
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah mmm ah probably not
You look so familiar too
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused
Cause that can't be love
You took advantage of a good thing
And that ain't a good thing
Take it how you want
I guess she forgot how I used to hold her
The nights she was goin' through it,
Crying on my shoulder
And did a 360 it's like she got colder
I'm starting to regret all the things that I showed her
But I'm a rider
She used to be my roller
I guess the general just lost his best soldier
I thought I felt some type of bond and got close to her
She mean to me more
'Cause ya boy a ghost to her
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah mmm ah probably not
You look so familiar too
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused"

And you already know you ain't gotta ask me you can see that everything is up
And I'm so bout my money you ain't talking about no money you ain't even gotta bring it up
And I hope you don't think me give a sugar honey iced tea or a middle finger up
I just stay sucker-free, leave the lames where they be, and I let my chips pringle up
Everybody calm down, there's enough to go around, you just gotta say how much you want
Don't know what you're looking for, unless it's a problem, I promise this ain't what you want

Like it's designed in their favor
Like it ain't outlined for them to waver their rights for a little fame
Get into bullshit fights for a little name to get
Noticed by some niggaz that don't give two fucks about you
Till you make them a few bucks they doubt you
Tell them you don't do the jobs and shucks and they
Route you to the shelf
See there is no money is good health
So they need you to be sick with it
Ill content and delivery niggaz
This nation thrives of misery nigga
So if you ain't trying to let you hard times increase my wealth
Nigga keep that progressive shit to yourself
This is the business of buying souls and we only fuck
With those who try to sell them
You see they may see me as an adversary 'cause they know
I'm trying to tell them about the farest artist who
Grow only to meet indutry acess
How they take a niggaz dreams and write them off in their taxes
Contracts is confusing
But don't worry they'll appoint the lawyer for you
Whore you
Loan you funds to fuck your soul and make you pay it all back
And still maintain control of stroll your track and your hot ass slow flow
They'll keep you looking good and all that
But no dough
You see when they get a bitch they got a bitch
Incontrary to popular opinion it ain't my sisters that
Switch is my brothers we the dumb motherfuckers
Harderst niggaz in the street turn to industry suckers
'Cause we refuse to do the knowledge
Nigga you can't learn this shit in the streets or in college
So you better pick up a book or something
Or fuckin' Black Ice will put it in a hook or something

Got you pumpin that poison while they paint you them

I bring the drama back where you lives, flatter your wiz
Reload and then point the Mag at your kids
So what I sound remorse, the records I still peep guns on me
But the difference now is only Deserts
If I talk it's gonna be reckless; I'm ready to die
So when I apply pressure, niggaz gon' respect it
Tote guns to rob niggaz, I told 'em to use
And leave enemies of friends that like broken and bruised
They ain't crazy, they just broke and confused; cross me
And they'll be talks of how they found the man smoked on the news
I'ma career crook - they used a mug shot from my graduation picture
And my junior high school yearbook
Paul Cain never appear shook
Yeah I might talk to my enemies but never police (nah)
You wanna converse it better be brief; you ain't gotta say much
Show me the money and the cheddar'll speak
If it ain't involvin bread, I ain't with it
I don't need D's on me, I'm already dodgin Feds
When the shots from the revolver spread
Duck, I don't discriminate, leave CEO's and artists dead
Make slugs a part of his head
Vanish then pop up in a SL double nickel, scarlet red

When I pulled the 5 out; I kinda expected
For the backstabbers, to be standin behind me, wit they knives out
Then the Range, wit the fins drove in
I wasn't shocked to see my foes, dressed in friends clothin
But - I still pull through the sty; wit handguns
As big as the one, Robocop pulled from his thigh
You prolly heard about the bullets I buy; and how it look like
I'm throwin' batteries, when the bullets shoot by
So what, you wear a vest, why would I care
If I aim for ya chest, that be a good idea
Nigga, it's nothing to clap ya; but I'm more worried
'Bout the groupie cops, who wanna put they cuffs on a rappa
That's why I'm limpin off wit a freak; and a lawyer
Who woulda got O.J. Simpson off in a week
I could show you how to blow up on ya own; in a Benz
That'll hit a buck! and make the windows go up on they own
Wit a stash box compartment for; a handgun
That make holes the size of peep holes, on apartment doors
My closet look like department stores; and you wonder why
Ya girl's comin' home, wit a cigar sip for
'Cause I just dump the light Dutch, mash the guts
You won't believe how much ass I touch
Who else struts pass the sluts, and a chain wit so much
Ash and cuts, that it hangs much pass the nuts
That's why I get followed by broads; wit deeper throats
Then the people at the circus, that be swallowin swords
Y'all hopin that the Don fall off; but my money's long enough
To keep shootin ya bank until, ya arms fall off
I'm eatin, and I ain't have to use someone's utinsels
And when you clean as me, you know that every bum is against you
But please don't let someone convince you; to test the kid

From the 745 on the 105 won't be nobody in the club but m, e you can say anything you want about my business better hold your tonge unless you witness my life first hand, my joy, my pain not just my music and my name.
Fall Back, I'm tryna breathe and you killing me
Fall Back, I understand that you feeling me
I ain't gotta attitude but I'ma flip if you don't give me room to move
Fall Back, I'm tryna breathe and you killing me
Fall Back, I understand that you feeling me
I ain't gotta attitude but I'ma flip if you don't give me room to move
(Lloyd Banks)
You can bet'cha bottom dollar, if there's ever a room that I'm tied up in
The armor throw bullets like Boomer Esiason
Give him a wound where his eye has been, then lift him
Off the ground like a hot air balloon when it' firin
My game smoothe as Mariah's skin, but I'm popular
So I travel with the goons when I slide up in
I'm blamed for the heat 'round my way, I made it
Without a Making of the Band or a Freestyle Friday
Why you wit him if his troops don't buck? I'll have the coroner
Wrap you up in plastic like a fruit roll up
I get brain like every female in my past intellegent
And take in more nuts then your average elephant
They actin' like they own slugs and amory, but if we bump heads
They be talkin' faster than Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
The names you can call me but broke ain't one
I'm in the game for the O.J. run, my goal not done
Go in ya'house and get cha'old gray gun
We got some big enough to be a court case son
And I've learned to overcome the new faces, I'm startin to
Heat up, so my dick get more toungue than shoe laces
You can catch me in the hood, a couple G's and I'm bangin' things
High 'cause I go through more trees than orangatangs
You're gonna make me put the clip in and pop ya
You're horrible nigga, I'd rather sit through an' opera
Fall Back, I'm tryna breathe and you killing me
Fall Back, I understand that you feeling me
I ain't gotta attitude but I'ma flip if you don't give me room to move
Fall Back, I'm tryna breathe and you killing me
Fall Back, I understand that you feeling me
I ain't gotta attitude but I'ma flip if you don't give me room to move"
36,Feel Like I'm Back,2009,Loso's Way (2009),,Fabolous,"Aye my nigga, do me a favor. (What's that my nigga?)
If you happen to bump into the streets
Can you please tell him I'm back? (oh okay I'll do that.)
I appreciate that (My nigga)
Na nana na, nana nana na (4x)
Well all right, okay
I've been gone, and away
For too long, a mistake
But right now, I feel awake
I'm feeling like I'm back (Just like I'm back)

Said I'm feeling like I'm back (Just like I'm back)
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (Feel like I'm back)
Hey hey hey hey
I take it in
I blow it out
On the courthouse steps after they throw it out
Bentley waitin by the curb, I spurr it out
Doors don't open they self, the chauffeur get out
My exhale made ayething a foggy blur
I make my way through the reporters and photographers
I take my lady's hand, I shake my attorney's
Slide in the back seat and let's begin this journey
Told the driver hold off before we pushed out
I let my window down and out comes a kush cloud
Any last words?
Justice has been served
Now back to the streets that's what the hustlers deserve
Well all right, okay
I've been gone, and away
For too long, a mistake
But right now, I feel awake
I'm feeling like I'm back (Just like I'm back)

Said I'm feeling like I'm back (Feel like I'm back)
Hey hey hey hey
I ain't lose a step
I ain't miss a beat
Thugs have emotions, we miss the streets
We kiss the heat
We love the block
We rubberband the money, we black glove the glock
I'm screamin free at last, free at last
She used to send me pictures so I could see that ass
That's real talk, that's a real bitch
Fly as I left, the minx still fit
They know my name but in case they didn't know so
Appear in a casket courtesy of Loso
So, you should have your shit packed
I'm'ma need ya to not be here when I get back
Well all right, okay
I've been gone, and away
For too long, a mistake
But right now, I feel awake
I'm feeling like I'm back (Just like I'm back)

Said I'm feeling like I'm back (Just like I'm back)
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (Feel like I'm back)
Hey hey hey hey
Aye daddy's home after a long day
I'm from the hood, I came a long way
But I ain't goin' back, I'm just visitin
I hear the streets talkin', I'm just listenin
If they ain't talkin' money, I'm out my business then
If dying what it is, then what is it then?
I'm out here grizzyin, swizzyin
It's me bitches, sittin' in a phantom
Got the streets back but I didn't pay the ransom
My father who fathered you treat you like my grandson
I came back for it like I left it nigga
You try me you get more than a Efa F it nigga
Well all right, okay
I've been gone, and away
For too long, a mistake

Loud and clear - Jersey's here
Hey, Ja, Joey
Triangle Offense do it like ... (whoa)

(Female voice: ""yeah"" - repeated)
(Verse 1 - Fabolous)
Maybe it's the dipped Jesuses
The twin Jesuses with diamonds in them, that's clear they break gooses
Maybe 'cause I'm in they roofless or the Hypno I put in they juices
I'm the ""Joe Millionaire"" of rap and one of these chicks
Is gonna get picked and gonna get dicked
I'm all that and then some, y'all cats have been bums
That's pocket change, you call that an income?
Tell the way I walk that I'm doin' my thing (uh huh)
A lot a niggaz talk but ain't doin' a thing (uh uh)
Whatever come in the fall, I do in the spring
See I told y'all I'm doin' my thing
And I'm winnin' by a landslide, damn right
Don't you see the way they point at this man's ride
Now, look at here, I took it there
I'ma make this statement loud and clear - Brooklyn's here
(Chorus - Joe Budden (female voice - repeats ""yeah"" in background of Chorus))
That fire, problems in the club, reach for that snub
Look dog it's on fire, that's when you turn it up
You wanna burn it up, come deal with them riders
Small one on my hip, when you hear the clip
You got to see fire, when it all hits the wire
We gonna light it on fire
(Break - Joe Budden)
We gonna do it like
We gonna do it like
(We gonna light it on fire)
Triangle Offense daddy
Cain (we gonna light it on fire)

38,First Time,2007,From Nothin' to Somethin' (2007),,Fabolous,"First time you kissed my lips
The first time your finger tips
Touchin' me couldn't resist
The first, the the first
Wooh ...i think everybody remember the first time

Guess who, first time fab
Sound like you hear me for the first time again baby[haha]
First time you kissed my lips
The first time your finger tips
Touchin' me couldn't resist
I knew I was meant for this
My first time checkin' you, only took a second to
Start inspectin you, without disrespectin you
Wasn't inspectin you, to say it was affectin you
What you wearin got me starin' like you butt naked boo
It may seem, like I don't even reckon you
But I day dream, about kissin' on the neck of you
Style is impeccable, smile is incredible
Ain't nothin' like ya, and baby I done met a few you
The way I feel its almost like crush[crushh]
My heart beats faster its almost like a rush[rushh]
And that's just when you in a in a room
I could tell when you round by the scent of ya perfume
I see why they put these r&b songs together
I feel like mariah ""we belong together""
It's my pleasure, I treasure, that I met ya
I could get ya on the first time
The first time you kissed my lips
The first time your finger tips
Touchin' me couldn't resist
I knew I was meant for this
The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
The first timein side of you

Unh (uh-huh unh) yeah
There's alot of money over here
(Hahahahahaha) Ha Ha
Unh (unh unh unh) That's word to Brooklyn
I'm back I don't know what the fuck is wrong with these niggas
Maybe 'cause I'm eatin And these bastards fiend for my grub
I carry pumps like I serve gasoline to these scrubs
Have you seen my Aston leanin on dubs
And they can't afford chrome so they puttin' vasoline on they hubs
I'm lookin' for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub
These niggas hate I'm movin so much cash and cream in the club
And don't pass my green on my bub
But I'm a fly nigga that don't do much to pull her and dick her
Everyday I'm poppin' a tab and pullin a sticker
Everyday I'm switchin the tags and pullin up sicker
Every ""K"" I'm loadin the mags with bullets to flicker
And I ain't hesitatin homie I'm pullin it quicker
So you can act tough After a few pulls on some liquor
Got 'em pullin on niggas
And they won't be goin' nowhere for a while
They might as well pull out a snicker Ye-Ye-Yeah
Forgive me father for I have sinned
But look at all this money that I spend
And look at all this jewlery that I'm in
And look at all the places that I've been
And look at all the women in those brims
Look at the blue flames that I'm in
I look at all the bullshit that there's been
And if I had another chance I'd do it again
Anywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me
Pokin out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty
Think I throw you grams if you read with me
Just because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy
Dammit we P-driddy??? Now I got G with me
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties
I keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam
But with the soap it's gonna blam
The info put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham
That's why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam
Dope and hunn-ed (hundred) grams rope and hunn-ed grams
At the same time our artist get to open Summer Jam
Hope you understand or use better sense
These niggas don't want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga!
I'm in a waggy with 'em passin by ya
With a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier
What I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier
When you can smell it through the bag you know that's some fire
Gettin' stressed by these hotties is regular
I got a magazine to press to your body like editors
Test me somebody I'm beggin ya
I got the gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator
I'm a hustler I don't sling no rocks to the fiends now
Got dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef
'Cause I chop jobs bigger than Chris Rock front teef
I'm the nigga tearin the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup
Of the Cris
And while you at probation fillin a small cup full of piss
I'm in a coupe with a roof that ball up like a fist (Catch up!)
That's right I'll do it again nigga (unh yeah)
I'm a motherfuckin ghetto superstar nigga (unh)
Desert Storm Street Family (unh) we here (yeah)
Young G's Salute (yeah)
Get this fuckin' money man

Bring some money out homey, we spend again
Wipe the frown off shorty, we grinnin again
Did he say again? Yesssss... we winnin' again
(Fabolous)
I'm ridin' through the metropolitan, everybody hollerin
Me I'm just acknowledgin, with this million dollar grin
Shine like a halogen, cool as the island wind
I don't judge myself but if I do I'd give my style a ten
Met a chick, who belong, on front of Cosmopolitan
Thick in the right place, otherwise she model thin
She don't do no swallowin, but she got a wilder friend
Who don't give a fuck, I told both of them to follow then
I'm with the familiar, you might be familiar
With a few faces but they still the nine milli-a
They be like the Young Guns, so I guess I'm Billy bruh
I do more than William Bryant, I'm a little Willie-er
Change a little chillier, wrist a little sillier
And I'm grown, so I'm not, really the, kid at all
But I hope you get it y'all, I can't say I did it all
But believe that 'fore I leave it I'ma try to get it all
What I don't get at all, is what these critics call
Stuntin, don't mean nuttin, they don't live her like they read it y'all
It ain't the car, it's the way it's kitted y'all
Meanin' it's the little things, like the way my fitted fall
The way my posture lean, the way my necklace hang
You should respect this gang, if not expect this bang
But all this wreckless slang, it don't effect us mayne
They build you up to break you down, it's just like Tetris mayne~!
That's why I sex Ms. Thang, and let the next miss hang
And even if I wake up late I do the breakfast thang
That's an important meal, I is the important deal
Jay brought me to Def Jam, feel like it's Jordan deal
I'm young mellow game-winning young fellow
Remember me, I mixed one white with one yellow
Turned nuttin into somethin', you can do it too
This the music that you do it to, 'Lo-so"

Fab's livin' la vida loca
Only nigga in the hood you can come see for either weed or coca
Nark's wanna see me and my team in a chair
They heard about the kid with the high beams in his ear
DEA been lookin' for proof since 9-3
When I came thruogh in the Benz with the roof behind me
Tell them jake's through on bullet proof's and find me
You need extingwishers to go in the booth behind me
Who the fuck wanna beef
My Fendi knits be (3X) so you can't see what's tucked underneath
And I might not even drop
Just take my advance and make a small town in Cleveland pop
""Vivrant Thing"" on my hip, that will make you ""Breathe and Stop""
Rock ya chain in ya shirt, Your roll (Rollie) with the sleeve on top
You niggas know where my heat stay at

Niggas don't think I'm still shavin crack
'Cause I pull up in a truck with a system that make the pavement crack
Baugettes have my face and beard covered
And I keep a Leathal Weapon like Mel Gibson and Dan Glover
Now I lose V Money and C Lo
And the cops think me and Muggs is G Money and Nino
I don't hit these honey's with C-Notes
Rather put them on Greyhound, Strap these honey's with kilo's
Type of gangsta every chick wants
I get Nike's from Aster you won't see hit the store for 6 months
Something 'bout the Beamer (X5)
When I come through it be increasing a skeo's sex drive
Half the click look like they stuck Genisis up
The other half is tryin' to wrap they sentances up
I'm never gone hate, Half these artists never slum weight
When they call NY, it's the only time they touch the 7-1-8

Pull in ya drivers side and unload
They find ya when its time for your ride to be towed
On side of the road
With ya brain on ya passenger side of ya Rove (Rover)
Y'all niggas ain't gangstas till y'all ridin'

It's g-a-n-g-s-t-a
That's how it be and it's gon' say (Y'all know whoooooooo)
That's how it be when you see me
That's how it be in NYC (Y'all know whoooooooo)
If it's me it's got to be
If it's me it's got to be
G-a-n-g-s-t-a (Y'all know whoooooooo)
(Verse One)
I'm still living la vida loca
Where hoes sell prices on weed or coke-a
For the hustlers, for the customers, trust the buzz
It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does (woo HAH!)
They love me just because
I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo (Ha ha ha ha)
With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta nigga
I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and hoe-hounders
I can tell when they ain't learn to lean
They gold cups missing stones, turning green
I roll up wrist in chrome, burning green like what's good
(Verse Two)
God was in a good mood, on the day he made me
I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me
And I wouldn't change it for nothing
I stay on point, that's 'cause I know the danger of stuntin'
But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'
It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta
That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'
'Cause we can tell by the body language you frontin'
And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag
Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag
I'll put the red dot on you like a Japan flag
You need some high heels and a handbag
(Verse Three)
I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em
Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots
Give me a .40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine
Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine
But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta
Oh no thank ya, I earned my key
My name'll get you fucked up, and burners tee
That's gangsta love, from the heart
Yo I told y'all from the start
And now (y'all know whoooooooo)
Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up
Cali bringin' peeps and weed up
I'm coming through with a bunch of girls that'll deep a seed up

I could be in Fiji, one call to Gigi
She on some Belly shit like X with a squiggie
They say it's gangsta but it's just the way of life
If life's a bitch better make everyday your wife
I'm from the era of the shootouts from drug spots
Happy to be here so I smile in my mug shots
The David Dinkins years, I even dug Koch
Before the George Bush drugs watch, Bloodclaat!

When the song go on, throw on, ya tight mugs or ya stares
It's like Bugs up in here
Like Thugs up in here
Throw ya fingas up like you gon' snipe slugs in the air
Haters - might have a slight grudge when I'm there
See the strobes on my wrist, light bubbles in my ear
Ladies pass through, I might rub on her rear
Pop Cris' in her face, make her wipe suds from her hair
Even dykes tug on my gear the way I like strut up in here
Don't get the Nike's smudged that I wear
Drinks be flingin, minks be swingin'
The way the pinky-ringin', link be blingin, you think we slingin?
I wanna see the roof of your coupe, sittin' behind ya
18 inches and up, no sittin' on minors
After tha club hittin a diner, spittin' the lines
And end up in a hotel, gettin' vagina
Ladies- Rub ya tits if ya gettin' right (Hey)
Niggas- slap ya dicks if ya gettin' right (Ho)
Don't be thinkin' bout that nigga that you wit tonight
Don't be thinkin' bout that chick that you wit tonight
Ladies- Rub ya tits if ya gettin' right (Hey)
Niggas-Slap ya dicks if ya gettin' right (Ho)
If gettin' right is the only thing you wit tonight
Ladies (Hey)
Niggas (Ho)
Ma, it's hard to stop and not admit it
You like the way the drop I got is kitted
Cops can't spot who is it
You wanna stop and jot ya digits
Must be how I hop on yatchs and visit, tropic spots I did it
The top the watch is glitted
Make niggas wanna bop they knots, stop and plot to get it
Like I won't pop a shot in fitteds
I got the type of machine guns that cops and swats prohibit
I wanna drop but not to hit it, stop we not committed
Think we hittin shoppin' spots, forget it
Move ya neck, rock from side to side
Neva get checked, me and my glock side and side
This in ya deck let it knock inside ya ride
We in the 'jects of the blocks in the widest five
Spendin a grands nutin for 'lous (lis)
You ain't got on a badge playa, so why you handcuffin the chicks?
Y'all hardly see I be 'round
But when I do, I be, I be down in a VIP lounge
I get in the club, I don't need ID now
Bulky knit, can't even see my 3-pound
Y'all know how that kid from B-Stuy be down
Y'all see my C-pound, y'all see y'all be drowned
Skee-o, gotta, re-ply she down, which sheet I meet down
I know she gettin' right- HEY
Ladies tug me when I strut
So this thug be in the cut, takin' bubbly to the gut
Rays beamin, y'all think I be day-dreamin'
But I stay schemin like, ""Shortie could get it""
Next screenin, they see all this ice and grey gleamin
They like ""Damn, Shortie could get it""
And I may be crazy
But I see some ladies tonight that should be drinkin' my baby's baby"

Who have the weekend occasion
Sneak in the Days Inn
I'm never tweakin' of haze an frequently blazin'
Now if they ain't on ya face it ain't the cheeks that I stay in
Can't deny it, Used to take weeks and persuasion
Now I just be lookin' down at these freaks in amazement
With a girl, The first thing I peep a notice
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is
So you ain't gotta be perfect
I'll buy you whatever you want, But your heads gotta be worth it
Still what I mean is
Your brains gotta send chills through my penis
Till I feel like a geinus
Look at it from a playa's postition
I got a scholarship, I get smart without payin' tuition
My classes be like two three hours
That's why I'm the smartest young guy since Doogie Howser
Still what I mean is
I really just wanna get smart until I feel like a genius
And all that I ask is
That you help me get good grades in all of my classes
Still what I mean is
I really just wanna get smart until I feel like a genius
And all that I ask is
That you help me get good grades, Ma in all of my classes
These bitches they done got real bad
Cause now I pull out, leavin' 'em lookin' like model for a ""Got milk?"" ad
I'm a teachers pet
And even if you good at math ma
You'll have trouble countin' each bauggette
All it takes wit hood tutors is some good buddha
And promise to buy them some of them Razor foot scooters
They don't care where the cops is
Outta the blue they stop biz
Teacher started givin' me a pop quiz
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs
Pocket full of green, Duke on it invented the night bulb
I might pass on a female, And call up a subsitute just for night
Class in the CL
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared
Can't tell her from givin' my dick CPR
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurtin', before squrtin
It's for certain
You are the weakest link, Goodbye
You know my girls in North and South Caddy
They all for mouth waxin'
And the whores in Texas, Oral sexes
I head to Cali, Take more blows to the head than Ali
And the Philly momies suck the kid outta Willie Bonnie
And the way females so Southern Hospitality in ATL
Don't even know them hoes
In South Beach, They let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece
Forget about Vegas, The head is outrageous
The broads in Seattle will make ya knees rattle
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in VA
Them hoes in Detroit will suck the Breevort
My dick don't get to die down when I'm in Chi-Town
My bitches in B-More, Blow till they knees sore
Good damn, there face I, ain't screwed down in St. Lou
New York, It ain't got no pipe instructions
They just suck outta you like liposuction"

(Intro - Fabolous)
From hood to hood they see what's hood
And know who I be! uh!
(Verse - Fabolous)
I got the Yankee leaning, just sittin' over to browse
And the G4 is just getting over the clouds
You can't tell me that I ain't what's up right now
I got a bottle of Tequila upside down
There's some chicks wit boyfriends that are up tight now
'Cause they know the big 'dog' had a 'pups' like wow
I'm stuck in my city ways
Heading over seas wit a zip of New York City's haze
You rats can keep running through your city's maze
Until you get sprayed with the pesticide
I know you in that hole, you best to hide
Like the rest who tried, who went and testified
Of course your girl wanna slide over and be rubbed
And don't mind taking rides over the G dubs
I ride Rovers on Spre-dubs
Please don't be another dude who died over a ski dub, chill
(Chorus - Fabolous & (Thara))
From hood to hood they see what's hood and know who I be
From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be
From state to state they cannot hate, they know who I be
From the east to west, through the midwest and downsouth it's Ghetto!
(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!
(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!
(Verse - Fabolous)
I get it jumping like a lo lo '64
And bet they hop on it like a pogo stick pro
I'm chilling wit these go go chicks though
That do the kind of things that belong in a porno flick yo
You know it's him and the gang
Wit the bling worked on, that remind you of lemon meringue
But remember the thangs, ain't too far
And y'all wanna hear 'em go bang bang bang
Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching 'em closely
I know the snakes gon' slither soon
The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon
The back feels like sitting in the living room
I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman
It's that man that back to back plat' scan
I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living
You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga!
(Verse - Fabolous)
They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky
But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees
I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's
On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi
Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed
And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis
Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call 'em the Fresh Prince
And throw rose petals when I walk
They love how I came back hard like good blow
And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho
That's what hood though, yes I would know
That's 'cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers
Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother
I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others
The man no other, 'cause I been in it
My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes
I'm gone! catch up!

They all go crazy over me
Don't matter what part of the world
Girls want to be part of my world
Look, I done had my share
Bringin' round me, is a bad idea
I take Big or small, short or tall
Light or dark, I try them all
'Cause I like
From stupido groupie hoes
To one of these r&b group skio's
I need a slick mouth, thick south, brickhouse
Or I may date, a-rate playmate
Ten in the face, thin in the waist
Tight in the thighs, light in the eyes
Even those
Who think they the shit, on some female player shit
I keep my
Walkin' on pedicured paws
Touchin' wit' manicured claws
If you waxed down, and tanned up
So let me see ya hands up
Now
I like my
In four inch Christian Laboutins
Lips made for kissin' and poutin' I like my
Fat butt, flat gut, and that strut to drive a cat nuts
I like my Gangsta pretty, stank saditty
No change, only got franks and fittys
Them Natural born freaks, wit blonde streaks,
Seven's on cheeks
My nothin'less than a dime piece
Pink face cartier time piece
I like my

Wit' tits that'll bust out tops
I like my Classy and sassy,
Still know how to be nasty
I Like my

No bra's and no draws'

From the Asian to the Malaysian
I even had the Bahtian to the Caucasian
I spend most the weekend
Wit' pretty Puerto and Costa Rican
Then again, I love Dominicians
And might be stylin' wit' a Italian
I be shakin for a Jamaican
And take by the million if they Brazilian
I'm sailin wit' a Australian
Or trafficin' wit' the south African
Panamian or Grenadian
You know I cross the border for a Canadian
I need a miss that's Swiss, a freak that's Greek

Yo, Fabolous strive for digits, even connive to get it
Niggas can't tell me nothin' dun, the 5 is kitted
For Dead Presidents any cat alive can get it
I walk around covered in ice like I survived a blizzard
Got enough chips to bribe you wit' it
Pay off security at clubs, get my guns and knives admitted
I'm the type that gets tried and acquitted
If my vibes ain't wit' it I pull the Four-Five and spit it
Then niggas run to the precinct and describe who did it
Come home and find the necks on their wives are slitted
I got niggas on my side committed
To leave you and the driver splitted
With your brain spilled inside your fitted
Fabolous, the only way to I.D. him is in a Five BM
Puffin' sticky green till my eyes be slim
Operate with more chips than IBM
Fuck with me and make the news at Five PM.
If y'all see me gettin' locked it gotta be drugs
If y'all see chrome on the truck it gotta be dubs
If I'm givin' somethin' to haters it gotta be slugs
If it's one thing it's gotta be it's gotta be thug
No info, I'm I'm leakin' it gotta be blood
If my earlobes are hangin', it gotta be studs
If the bitch on her knees, it gotta be love
If it's one thing it's gotta be, it's gotta be thug.
(Fabolous)
Niggas don't wanna play around, they see how calm I do things
Swarm in a blue range, armed with two flames
Flex play my joints, drop bombs like Hussien
Catch a cataracts, glance at the charm and new chain
I got coke in every part of Brooknam that you name
Niggas want it, when you wave firearms their views change
End up havin' to move they Moms to Ukraine
Get ADT alarms and new names
Come in the club, under each arm is two dames
Buyin' bottles of Dom with my loose change
Niggas hate me now 'cause I catch the eyes of dimes
Flooded the hood with Tre's the size of dimes
Ride through the hood with chrome pokin' off the wheels
I'm in the game tryin' to get broken off with Mils
Shove the gun in your mouth, have you chokin' off the steel
Niggas love the band, but the chicks open off the grill.
(Fabolous)
I'm ready to address the haters and underestimaters
Hop in the truck, ride up on y'all like escalators
Hit ya chest up, leave you hooked to respirators
Bed ridden talkin' to investigators
Now these ladies will do anything just to date us
'Cause we skate around on ice like escapaders
Dressed in Gators, in peace I'm restin' haters
When police come for me, fly West to Vegas
Ridin' or dyin', niggas know I'm ridin' with iron
Smoke compartment in the dash that I'm hidin' the lye in
My pockets is fat, y'all accounts is on slim fast
I'm Twenty, with Twenty's on a M-Class
Just gimmie head it won't sweat your hairdo out
We ain't tryin' to hear you out we tryin' to air you out
Make y'all run to the stores and clear Clue out
'Bout to put cameras in the truck, take the rearviews out

It's Loso just in case you ain't know so
I'm feelin' like Arnold in the 70's in here ya know
Real icy, Call me Arnold Frozennigga or sumthin
They say New Yorks got a problem, I'm there solution
I'm the breath of freshness through this air pollution
Dog you the smog that clogged up the city
I jog through ya fog, Dog I'm the diddy
Of this rap marathon, I'm lyrically in great shape
My late tapes are like how to lose weight tapes
The worst enertainers use me like a personal trainer
They try to use my verses as gainer
But these lightweight rappers, Don't know what they up against
I put they pockets on a weight loss supplement
Ya powder sniffin if ya can't see our difference
It's like dumbbell curls compared to powerliftin
The way I pull up in whips, It looks betta than the pull ups and dips
Bein done by the bartender, I mean maybe it's my star spendin
But better get her to that car window
And shorty said her name was carlinda
Dats cool, Now won't you get up in this car linda
Later I could bend ya like a car fender
Have that ass wakin' up tomorrow tender
The perfect push-up that make ya pecs swell
I like to purple kush up, And then I exale
Ya gotta breath, 1 and then the 2
I do a couple laps and be runnin' it in 2
I'm nutritious, I ain't in GNC
Try the new dishes on the truck from GMC
He in sea, He ain't got to do no dancin
These diamonds are so performance enhancin
I'm princess cut up, Canary them stones
And I'm well known for how I bury 'em home
I just do my thing, And then I carry 'em home
I mean the world don't need another Marion Jones ya heard
Cryin lyin' that she never did it
Some women are Clemons, They just keep goin' with it
Don't sweat it, Be like Pettit just admit it
And for the record they be sayin' Barry Bonds hit it get it
We outta here baby, Loso is so outta here baby
Street fam is so outta here baby
And here's another hit barry bonds"

[Lil Mo] Right here... Right here... right here baby
Here's another one
(Fabolous)
You need to holla at somebody real such as myself
Wont nobody do as much as myself
And it's so real ill hop out and get the dutches myself
For a pretty girl as such as yaself
'Cause ima busy man I don't see too much for myself
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself
But I... make the time when I have to
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women
There's some who be willing and skimming
And dive in to relationships 'cause I got a million to swim in
They'll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous
Others pass diseases that you can catch now
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world
And... I don't wanna live in it alone
Come on
(Chorus - Lil Mo)
Ill give you all my love
And you can always trust
My loyalty, honesty, and security (and ill never)
Ill never leave (no... no... no)
Can none of these other chicks fuck wit me
So holla at somebody real ('cause i)
'Cause I'm so real
(Fabolous)
(Real love) I'm searching for a real love like j blige in 92
(Awwwwwwh) but I pray I will find you
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you
The fake may try to blind you
That's why I stay fly like I do
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to
First I need a girl that may die as my boo
Then I may try the I do's
But... I refuse to be trick
Or used by a chick
Who gets amusement of kicks
Out of abusing my dick
When its real I'm all in it
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it
(No) before it didn't matter who
Now I look for some with a little attitude
I could chitter chatter to... good looking
But witty and compatible
Long hair wit a fatty too
And that'll do
(Lil Mo)
No I'm not trying to pressure you
But my loves to incredible
For to waste
In front of your face
Then I give you something you can feel
To let you know your hollering at somebody real
(Fabolous)
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you
The feelings that I feel could that be true
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away
That's till somebody real sways my way
Then I might spend some days aways
On a asia bay
Eating food made the cajun way
And sippin a lil saki
Blowin' a lil brocoli
But this world is full of fluzi's
And bullshit usually
I pull I'm choosy
And on this joint and at this point
I know I need to holla at somebody real
For real"

Met her up town on dykeman
Aight then
Light skinned
Starring with a slight grin, I don't know, Might been
'Cause I'm in this white benze
:: Honk honk ::
Or the way the Ice in the Brietling flash brighter than a lightning
But I knew from right then
She was 'bout her money, and how she fit right in knowing how I might spend.
To make a story short, other than a Tight End
Had a Washington Hieghts friend
Who bring that white in.
Set up a meeting, Her dude caught a flight in
Sat down at Sole, popped a bottle of white then
Got straight to business like two corporate white men
The food came, before I could take a bite in
He said ""You the type I usually don't invite in, but since we got a like friend I could get you like, 10""
I told him I could move like 10 by nights end
Put the white over the plate, like I'm throwing strikes in.
'El Duke' got a dude in the UK, Buy 5 bricks at a time, $22K
He send the Euro's I send the Puredo
Now that's the real meanin' of a ""Foreign Exchange""
He smiled. Duke finished his glass of wine
There's a van outside, pull your S-Class behind
My man will pass a dime, at 15 a pop
Tell shorty ""Make the drop, Don't make no stops!""
I gave him a hand shake some dollars for the tab
Gave shorty the location then I holla'd for a cab
I hit mike told 'em ""Send the wire to the buyers""
Word got 'round like we were passin' out flyers!
And them thangs went as quick as they came
I'm back being a hustler, this chick is to blame
And them thangs went as quick as they came
I'm back being a hustler, this chick is to blame
12 months in, turned a Benz to a Lambo
Everywhere the fam go, corks fly, Champ Flow--
I gotta celebrate, that's the way I am yo
In the past week I watched 50,00 grams go
Pocket full of money, Army full of Rambo's
Trunk full of bricks, Hand guns full of Ammo
Even got detectives if somethin' goes wrong
The money's so strong they see it from my perspective
But with my shorty, A nigga's so protective-
And should be, she's the one who knows where the connect lives.
She don't talk much, real calm and collective
Seen something in me 'cause shorty's very selective.
I tell'er fall back, shorty stilla drive
Said the rush of the risk just makes her feel alive
I listen at her fuss, saying ""that I must, let her do it 'cause they're ain't too many niggas that I trust""
So now time is flyin', I been kinda eyeing-
A ring for my queen who got me diamond buying
I'm in the GT headed up to CT, Lookin' for a stone to light her finger like ET
I got there, and got a call from a DT (detective)
Sounded nervous saying ""we need to talk now""
I told 'em chill out, I ain't in new york now
Any problems I got, get traced in chalk now!
But when I get back, we can meet and chit chat-
Better not be no bull shit, I ain't even wit that...
Back to what a nigga came out here for
This 5ct. Diamond without near flaw's
Head back to the city, call up the committee
Get ready for tomorrow, they're comin' in with 50
--I almost forgot, I gotta stop and see a cop
I figured it was a drop who must ain't get his gwop
He told me meet him by the bridge, I get there in a hurry
Got me worried and it's probably just a minor mix up
He said: ""Nah Los, FED's dun snatched ya chick up- Caught her at a pick up, scoopin' those bricks up! She gon' cooperate, in a fix up. She's probably at the headquarters now hangin' Flix up""
I asked him ""Was he sure""
Shorty's ""Mi Amore""
This happened to me before, with my man Diadore-
Over a Ki (lo) of raw-
My nigga got killed, caps got peeled and I still got guilt.
He assured me, I was hot- she had put 'em on me
Swore to Jesus' Tears that he was here to warn me.
Normally, I would have just ended her life-
But this was the girl I intended to wife
So I went home to shorty, had trouble sleepin'- shorty's kinda peepin my sudden discomfort
She woke up mad early, so I got up with her
Got dressed and told her I would hit the spot up wit her
She wanted to go alone, but a nigga insisted
Like ""Baby it's been a while"" and truthfully I missed it
We rode out, but she don't know that I done made a plan
Once she hits the spot, one shot- see you later man
I watched her in the building,
Knowing it's the last time-seein' her ass climb in and out of the car
Yo I even thought about gettin' out of the car
But sat back lookin' at the ring about to be y'alls
I let one tear fall at an unfair call
Ya whole life can change in just one year y'all...

Damn right, they come to a star
That's right, it comes with the car
Now tell ya boss, you can't come in tomorrow
My dro, come by the jar
They bring me drinks, why come by the bar?
Naw niggar, I ain't come here to spar
These hollow tips? I'll come were you are
Stomp through, Smooth with the soldiers
Two stepping, Moving ma shoulders
Now the moneys rolling in
We got bottles lined up like bowling pins
Mami, You stearing with a slouch
Stearing at me, While am standing on the coach
Come and get in a blue flames
Have a sip with a blue shit, Let rock!
Now you know I don't usually do this

And you know I don't usually do this
(But you gon smoke tonight)
Now you know I don't usually do this

Now, Whose hot?, Whose not?
I could take a few shots you got
I could burn a few knots you got
I could blow a few spots you got
But, I chill, I will
Get it the popping when ever I feel
I still shut it down
And am white and yellow studed down
Watching pretty girls strut it round
Take the birdies and plot it down
Like tiger woods did it
But am hood with it
You never seen a thug looked this good with it
And I promise that, Fuck with me
You better move where ""sadam"" is at
You see am in here with the white ones on
Tryna get fucked up, Before the lights come on?"

The lambo's milked out, No expiration
And I ain't ask for a estimation
I just pass the cake off, No hesitation
Ya see I'm nothin' like y'all guys
I just do the stuntin, Y'all niggas fall guys
And everyday I get the benny washed
It's Deja Vu like Denny Wash
Budget too big, Billionaire a hurt a label
Play it tight, Spray the creed on the purple label
Pie vay settings, Jacob got me linked up
The Bentley wag bulletproof like a Brinks truck
C.B.L, We don't care what ya homies sell
Rubberband around the stacks like a ponytail
I could meet a hoe sweeter than Damita Joe
She act conceited tho and I'm a get deleted yo
I'm not a musician, But I play a instrument
The ragin bull handle any knid of incident
The black latex, D's can't get the print
The flyin spur so fly, I had to get the Bent
Got initails on the door scrap, Initials on the floor mat
I ain't braggin homeboy, Dis my format
The 22's look like they ridin' on 4 flats
Young octopus, I carry arms
I draw to challengers, With cavali carry-ons
Freck Billionaire, I'm the 1 with the bling
Got canaries on the wrist, Not the ones with the wings
A real hood nigga, I got a lavage flow
I could push you into theaters like Magic tho
You don't want beef, You just want raps
I get ya lil ass smoked like a blunt wrap
C.B.L spray, What da fuck did you thought
I tote the cig, But I don't mean newport
I wash my money up the laundry way
I stay guccied down even on my laundry day
The linen clean, Splash ya [? ]
Double blue 62 smash ya limousine
You could set trip, But I get the ammo near
Like a bad allibi, Switch up the lambo gear
These other rap niggas, They could'nthold a candle near
They got it all screwed up, Like chandeliers
I'm gettin' money is my quotation
Family man, So I need the lambo station
Slick talk, I'll put a chamber into rotation
Director style, I shoot 'em on location
My hoe's hatian, trenny and croatian
Ass clap louder than an Oprah ovation
Double D's on her chest like Daredevil
I shoot dames at a 900 a pair level
I'm in perotta, The color of Ricotta
Cheese, Please you can't tell me not a
I don't share keys, Nor do I give her codes
I set run through records down on river road
Then I switched up, Posted on palleysay
The Denali stay, Smellin like Cali grade
I come through bar, Numba 9 squirts
Osama rich, That's the hard to find shirt
Ya rocks keep 2 they selves, Well mines flirt
They 2 clean, Board of Health couldn't find dirt
I'm rich bitch, And I'm screamnin it like ashy larry
They call me Brinks boy, Maybe it's The cash I carry
Rubberbands pop, You gon need a scrungee for me
She a jump off, Bet the chick a bungee for me
I came a long way, And I still stroll the avenues
Move and style, Louis V roll and travel
Local nigga, You never been to Poland have you,
So you couldn't judge me if you was holdon gavels
And I used to get the raw from Olivia
That was back when Raven Symone was olivia
I did the take-out, Meanin' that I ran orders
I had the transporter sittin' by the land borders
The rocafella a make you rather do a manslaughter
They goin' in June, It's comin' back with grand-daughters
So homie if you got a weapon tote it
You can't jump ship, Niggas won't accept you boated
When I was doin' it 4 TV, I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin' niggas try 2 find it and webisode it
A half of clip in ya hip, A make ya Elvis shake
You'll more then moan when ya bones and ya pelvis break
Benny drop cost two hundred and twelve to take
Red gut, White paint, Red velvet cape"

Seats is brunette, paint is dirty blonde
Speakin' of dirty blond, say hi to curvy don, Fergie John
With the body movement of a turbion
I just watch her, it's been a hectic year so I sit and get fried
Call the weed electric chair
But y'all on death row, one request left
You lookin' for ya girl, oh, she just left
Her and my dick just became B-F-F's

Nick name funeral got that from this killer flow
Err things still a go, my pockets be extra fat
Big money on deck like a rods next to bat, shit
Somebody contact the tabloids
I'm a big deal like a contract from Bad Boy
Yeah, it's all good baby, baby
My swag plays a big part so it's all gravy

Watch ya step, baby, gettin' out that G-M-C
You bust yo ass, girl, we both gon be on T-M-Z

The worst that can happen is a amber rose you
People runnin' up like damn, I knows you
Hey, ain't you? Yeah, I am that bitch
6 feet deep, nigga, yeah, I am that ditch
Throw it in the bag in the recession, I am that rich

I ain't what's poppin', bitch, I'm what's popular
If I'm the one to go at, nigga, what's stoppin' ya?
I call my gun, Nadia and I be finger poppin' her
Keep that bitch comin' like blakka, blakka

She say lets stay in the room and order Dom Cruz
It sounds like a plan
'Cause girl once I got you by your limbs
That guy who spot you at the gym can't put it down like I can
I wanna take you places further than where your feet walk
Why scream when your voice is better for sweet talk
A little accent, cute ass lisp
First a toast is said then a flute glass kiss
I like it when you whip yo hair, but that's Willow fault
I speak body language, f-ck pillow talk
We can wake up 'round noon on a Saturday
And make a f-ckin movie, now that's a matinee
But on the weekdays I wanna be yo' wake up call
Kiss yo' face before you put that make up all over it
You go from gettin' ready at the bathroom sink to gettin' bent over it

But tell me baby does he touch you and flirt?

I want you after dinner, your such a dessert
The night is lookin' sweet the only thing I'm tryna bite is yo physique
And in most cases with you
Only thing I wanna fight is gettin' sleep 'cause I eat and go to sleep
You know I is in the sheets, niceeeee
Don't touch it, let my eyes do the undressin'
Play Usher and take ya back to confessions

Come on ma
It's more than a flashing
I woulda traded it all in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashing
Just off the shore so you can hear when the water be splashing
The Drop top 3 in a quarter we dashing
Flawless diamonds in the water we flashing
The money we oughta be stashing
I make sure every quarter be cashed in
I can't really explain it
My friends be thinking I'm slipping
These girls be thinking I'm tripping
What kinda weed you be smoking
What typa drinks you be sipping
Sweet thing just to think of you dipping
Would have me with the blue so hard
You would think I was cripping
Now you relaxing in the Benz
Credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxing when you spends
But since you been asking about the friends
How'd you like it if both our names had Jackson on the ends
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak
Remind me of them trips to Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you it ain't because my whips is ruthless
So sit on chrome, dipped up deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary NVS dipped Jesus is
Other ballers look dumb when they press you
Five and sixes, you don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Being a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, this superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart while the villa being painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it can feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, yeah
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

My money talks in a Chris Tucker voice

You a stand up rapper, hip hop comedian
I start laughing as soon as I put your CD in
You joke, you joke, you kid, you kid
Should have went to Comedy Central with the vids you did

My brother my partner for real like the Wayans
Plus everything in live In Living Color
High rise checks diamonds the size of Robin Harris'

You call it a tribute, a ?? distribute
Sales was slow I got Paco to contribute
Some morals in each state, move weight, get caught,
Don't talk, Dave Chappelle niggas might break

Phantom is light gray sort of like Ashy Larry is
King of the one liner lil' rhymers watch what you say
You just a potty mouth like Andrew Dice Clay
I pop collars on niggas, I drop dollars on niggas
I jell O's together I Bill Cosby on niggas

Funnier than Dane Cook, you hit the Sufi

Make joke of them, I ain't the richest nigga but I ain't broke as them
I'm serious, petty worth will make a man delirious like Eddie Murph
Girls get curious

Bernie Macing
I ain't scared of you maf**kers kick ass
Hon stack thick ass
A deck of card VIP section hard
They try to holla at me you know the heckler broads
I'm popping Rose, I don't the neck to God

Watch your wise cracks or I'll be at your front door

(Haha, You know how we doin' baby?)
[Jadakiss] (Styles)
Keepin' it Gangsta, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yo
How many men could you kill? (Let me count all the bullets I got)
Many bricks could move, (you can say 20 a block)
Many niggas'll ride (you could fill a football field)
(How much money you got?) You think I signed a football deal
(My nigga give me the word, I'm gonna kill that lane)
You know major league niggas play the kidnap game
Have the kid missin' for days, listen and pray
(And I'm kill 6 of your niggas, 6 different ways
And we still got exza of rhymes) Still gangsta
(Try to run up on the guy, that send your legs to your mom)
And we still got kilos of coke
(Ruff Ryders to the death, ride or die nigga we know the oath)
That's why I'm tryin' to send this metal through your head
Cause you got me curious, you probably look better when your dead
Nine by the spine, (5th in the holst)
Scum bag it's them D-Block boys, daddy kissin' the ghost
(Comin' through like the ""Matrix"" in the A-6
Triple black leather, six-speed, with the gray stick)
Give me the safe, I spit at your face
Double clip in your mug, then have SP hit it wit mase
(And we just caught burners and do me I'll say this)
Your little niggas lookin' up to me like the walls in Green Haven
Keep heat and we shank ya, (rob ya and say thank ya)
Now that's keepin' it gangsta (keepin' it gangsta)

We your favorite gangstas, favorite gangstas (do better both)
Before these slugs sink hitters, weighs like anchors
We don't own clean guns (all our skets is dirty
I toss bullets, New York niggas gel like Testaverde
I don't keep the scope on the ratchet
And for the dope I'm gonna catch it)
Make sure the joint ain't point blank so they can't open your casket
My whole crew (got glocks on 'em)
In a hurry to shoot, (like they put shot clocks on 'em)
All that gossip we blast, better see if they possibly has
A V12 ambulance that will get you to a hospital fast
(We done came out the cages in shackles
I ain't call a pager to track you
I'm loadin' up gauges to whack you
We been riding together
And us back and forth), it's like puttin' Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden together
Soon as you get a crumb, they wanna bury ya
That's why I travel with a semi, like Eddie in ""Coming to America""
(Silencers, it sound like it's hummin' when I'm airin' ya
Won't know you hit, till your body start numbin' in that area)
The kids don't want to see the toast of mom and daddy
Plus we rather be roastin' Charming fatties
In a toasted armor Caddy

Or twisted, 'cause you'll get it twisted and fucked up

Half the click look like they stuck Genisis up

She keep callin' me, callin' me, I try to leave her alone but
She keep callin' me, callin' me and I gotta go
Damn, here we go again, I just came back
Girl, don't make me go again, she say you been in the streets
You was with that hoe again, money wrapped in rubber bands
What you sellin' blow again?
How she got you holdin' guns but you call that hoe your friend?
You ain't 'posed to bring her home, what do you show her in?
I was like show her in, never that, oh no
Anybody in the streets know that that's a no, no
So know I would never ever, ever, ever
Baby, I'm a G, yeah, that's right the seventh letter
See one thing about the streets, I know where the heffer at
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her at
But you know we had a bond, no ring, no paper
And I don't hear this shit when I bring home paper
My ears to the streets, what you gonna tell us?
You keep talkin' down, girl, you sound like you jealous
This is the last time, I know I'm 'bout to drive you crazy
Last time but I gotta see my baby
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more
Try to walk but I just can't leave her alone, girl
She keep callin' me, callin' me, I try to leave her alone
But she keep callin' me, callin' me and I gotta go
Hi honey, I'm home
She looked at me and said it's five somethin' in the morn
You smell like you been drinkin', the vibe from me this strong
I said, baby, that's cologne, she said, nigga, that's patron
If you wanna keep with them bad habits, that's fine
You think I'm with it then you out your rabid ass mind
They'll say tricks are for kids, most chicks woulda slid
But who ain't miss a visit through the six that you did
I'll be damned if I do another six with some kids
Who only see they daddy in them flicks on the fridge
Them niggas that you think are inna mix with ya shit
They the same reason Michael Vick's doin' biz
I say hold up, I met you, I was thuggin' back then
And you was ridin' with me holdin' on a Mack 10
But that was back when you ain't give a what
Now you standin' here tellin' me to give her up
This is the last time, I know I'm 'bout to drive you crazy
Last time but I gotta see my baby
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more, try to walk
But I just can't leave her alone, girl
She keep callin' me, callin' me, I try to leave her alone
But she keep callin' me, callin' me and I gotta go
Hold on, baby please, you can't leave now
No, John baby, please, we gonna get you to a hospital
As quickly as possible, life is full of obstacles
We gon' get you through this one
You looked me in my eye when you told me you was done
I played her for a fool but I guess I was the foolish one
'Member when she told me that she know how this dream ends
Late night phone call from one of my close friends
Tellin' you that we are rushin' to the ER
By this time tomorrow we was posed to be in DR
Me blowin' a cigar, you sippin' a tini
I told her pack her bags and don't forget her bikini
Then just like houdini, it all disappeared
The escape to paradise, didn't end like this I swear
Sorry baby girl, I tried the best I could
If I can't be in the streets I guess heavens just as good
This is the last time, I know I'm 'bout to drive you crazy
Last time but I gotta see my baby
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more, try to walk
But I just can't leave her alone, girl
She keep callin' me, callin' me, I try to leave her alone

I kinda thought you had the same feelings I had
And you helped sell it, like a fly ad
But you was Mac'n at the house, iPad
Not mad, but there's a few disappointments
Let's just say that I canceled on a few appointments
I blew paper with U, not a joint bitch
I say ""bitch"" when I'm tryna make a point, bitch
Other times, I call it how I see it
I won't give you the title if you don't know how to be it
Which proves, I love it when the shit's SMOOTH
But show yo ass to yo nigga that's a bitch move
Imma ride, but what are you about Joe
U gon pull a Tre and say let me out tho
Never saw it coming, what a cheap shot
Your strongest enemy's the one who know your weak spot
I kinda wonder if I cross your mind
Maybe you my X 'cause you crossed the line
Maybe you just never saw the crossing signs
'Cause the hand up measn don't walk
We don't talk, and somewhere there's a disconnection
U take it the wrong way so much misdirection
Baby what it is, tell me what it does
This is what it is, fuck what it was
But it was good while it lasted
But when it's dead let it go put it in a casket
And don't dig it back up
Got my swagger back up
I pick up to call you then I hang it back up
And Imma get back to 'em
To know a backstabber gotta turn Ur back to 'em
Or maybe it's just me and I'm going crazy
But let me ask you this; Where you going, Baby?"

We all in the building and its rocking like a crack house
All the sexy women wearing dresses with their backs out
My neck is usually light up but tonight we have a blackout
Call me Tom Edison 'cause I'm about to light up
My head is in the cloud
Felt like it just took a flight up
They tryin' to slow me down like that sizzurp in them white cups
Clear that Imma bubble like you shoke a fucking sprite up

Fifty grand richer from a thirty minute set show
Gangsta but I'm the flyest you ever met ho
Button up etro
The Air Jordan Retro
Million dollar neck row
Got homie upset so
Now I get the bank and make them petty dudes bet mo'
Told you from the get go

I just supply it
For those who buy it
Now I ride by it
It might start a riot
Chicks won't quiet
Long enough to try it

Might be Gucci down to the tidy whites
Okay, it's Loso, everybody knows so
My son is the heir to the thrown, Prince Joso

Blow game like the late Dizzy Gillespie had
That's some good jaw, pop quiz, good score
She call her pussy Mediene, that good raw
For you little cheap fucks, hood whores
You niggas soft in the middle, call them hood smalls
Everybody on the block going cuckoo
Phantom doors open like the clock that goes cuckoo
Birds poppin' out, sittin' on the hood

Yo, I ain't got no reason to trick or spend
Mami, I'm the reason the chicks begin cheesein' and snickerin'
Playa like me? every season these chicks have been
Talkin' how I came through the P's in a sicker Benz
Heard about the platinum visas the bricker bends
Jewels so icey I need freezers to sitck 'em in
I be's in the keys wit a click of friends
Trees and a liquor blend, I be too queezy and sick to grin
I don't care if a skeezer is thick or thin
It's gon' look like she havin' a seizure I stick it in
Skeos say ""can I get the keys to ya six again?""
After I nut, that's when amnesia be kickin' in
Most broads I done met, ain't see a guy
Who spend a G on gucci T's, five for sweats
I'm what chicks strive to get, I stay in the P.J's
You thinkin' (?) I'm talkin' pivate jets, uh
I need the cash in my palm, the ice in my charm - ma' be easy

Wanna lean to the side while I cruise in your ride - ma' be easy
(Put down that cheese)
Gotta have a broad wantin' and let me hold somethin' - ma' be easy

So the kid never stresses a female
And if you ask where I live they gon' give you
Addresses to e-mail
All that cops can suggest is that he sell
How I'm gon' push it unless it's a v-12
From S's to CL's, I request is detail
In the head rests his TV's dwell
They heard how many albums I presses for retail
And they can't get a dime unless it's a weed sale
And lets be real, catch me at the bar wit them crispy bills
Gettin' Cris' re-fills, my wrist be chilled
And my wardrobe look like I got an Ice Berg History deal
Still dames have been givin' me slow neck
And I don't even know what they real names have been
I feel ashamed to spend, 'cause when it comes to knockin' 'em down
I'm right behind Wilt Chamberlin
Ma you musta had too many weed totes
'Cause I ain't givin' you any C-notes
I'm all about floatin' on them new skinny speed boats
Hundred and somthin wit two skinny deep throats
Winter hit, I'm in a new finny ski coat
See the screens? ain't gotta use any remotes
No more shoppin' sprees I'm rough wit the ends
Keep honeys on their knees, scuffin' they shins
I deal wit nothin' but tens
I be the club king wit diamonds shuffling your friends
Chickens get keys, scuffin the Benz
'Cause they wanna lock me down like I'm Puff in the pens
Snatch any chink blond who feel my link longview

Hope trickin ain'n one of the things you think John do

And I let em', 'cause I can bend em'

My pimp game the same, don't forget the name
And when chicks peep the chain, they just can't restrain
Shorty don't try to fake it,
Just up and face it,
Your time is being wasted, your man's a basic
See it all in his face, that he's cheap and tasteless,
But life is what you make it, just watch the bracelet

I bet your man can't do it like me, (Nah)
His veins don't pump pimp fluid like me, (Nah)
He's nowhere near or like me,
And he probably think keeping you in check,
Is buying you a pair of Nike's
Why wouldn't I... get dome from her,
When the digits on my checks, look like phone numbers
Fuck It,
You might as well tell that buster skid addle,
Not even cockrin can help him win this custody battle
Yeah

You can catch me in the club, with a case of bub
And a thick chick to rub, niggas hate because
When they sit in the truck, they be quick to fuck
When I'm getting a nut, they just lick it up
I'm their favorite, plus the flow is dangerous,
I don't aim to get shortys out of relationships,
But they crave the chips, how many the range can fit

To the pace of the bass and this cash money record,
She just drop, drop, drop, damn you manny fresh
But I got my thing together, told her she could bring whateva,
Get some green, we could puff, get the cream, get the cuffs
Baby even when I'm gentle, it might seem like it's rough,
But if neighbors ain't complaining, you ain't screaming enough
And yeah they might hear as I'm slappin' to the jewel,
She said baby right there, do it rapid, do it smooth
I said baby, right where? Kept tappin to the groove,

And you can't catch your breath, you just laying there chilling
Like 1 and then the 2, 2 and then the 3, 3 and then the 4,
Damn I want some more
So I slam her to the floor, set the camera to record,
Throw them legs up in the air, just like Lamborghini doors
See we might have had some problems with the stamina before,
I'm no amateur, I'm sure I could ram into you sore
But I ain't tryna hurt ya,

I'ma slow it down and I'ma speed it up
And I will not stop,
Do it to you like a dude that ain't got no job
I ain't got nowhere to be, so I don't gotta leave,
Get the itis in the sheets, I'ma eat and go to sleep
Then we wake up and repeat, everything you do to me,
I'ma turn and do to you
And then I'ma black and blue that thing, dance for me
I love the way you move that thing, so nasty
I look and I say, ""Ooh that thing""
Make me wanna sing a song, anybody ever seen a,
Make 'em wanna sing along

Raindows in my diamonds, you would think my bezels gay
Passion, Pain, Pleasure, Trey knocking in the Escalade

Here today, gone tomorrow and I just met her yesterday

Can do a suit with a fitted on some draft day shit
Aand maybe I'm too busy to hear what the talent blind say

Top floor gusevoir see me with bench pressers
Slimes that push weight but ain't hit the gym never
Like quarters got red orders
Bags over bags stash house look like horters
Avon home tell marlo these my corners
Matress tight walls we snatching wife daughters
Only dimes keep on my time sheet

Who can hold us? the OG rollers New York city's coldest
Sour diesel, weed aromas, numb of casualties of soldiers
My position, remains the same while niggas change and switching
Politics from famous living, heavy chains and brainless women
Place to swim in, 22 spinning leather grace the linen
If you find a space forgive em, gangstas can't erase the sinning
Ducking po po, the 2k winners Banks, Vado, and Loso

King size, But right now it's full of cash
Niggas call me the dentist, They know I pull it fast
I know you hatin' niggas wanna let ya bullets blast
The SLR fully armored, With da bullet glass
I got my cleets on, You'll never catch me slippin black
Red white and blue tags, Call 'em the Diplomats
It's a fact, You would think I had immunity
I came from a hood nigga not a community
Trump tower, You ain't got the same room as me
I spray ya whole click, Killin' y'all in unity
Philly Freck got more bars more flows (Mo Cars Mo Hoes)
If it cost a quarter mill, Den trust me ya boy got it
If it cost a hundred thou, Trust me I boycott it
We make it rain in the club, Them other dudes cheap
I pass dat paper out, Sort of like it's looseleaf"

(Mary J. Blige)
(*Harmonizing*)
All my love is all I have
All my life I look for you
(Verse 1 - Fabolous)
I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now
But I can barely be found
And I rarely be round
But when I do, the jury be drowned
And you can see how clear the Pavees, and the Canaries be now
The top on the 5 series be down
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now
Although there was a time I would barely see thous
But I'm gettin' a multi-million dollar yearly fee now
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round
Everybody staring unnecessarily now
But there's no tints on my life, so you can clearly see now
(Chorus - Mary J. Blige)
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today your dream come true
You need me and I need you
Lovin' us is very special
Lovin' life and life and livin'
Your very special
(Verse 2 - Fabolous)
Y'all can never be built like me, even if y'all look at my blueprint
But since y'all watches look like its movement
I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint
Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent
100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint
Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints
I stay away from anythin' that look like a nuisance
But y'all gotta peep this rookie's improvement
I tip it with you and
Cause most dudes was doin' verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents
All I do is try to teach and look to influence
But it look like the students are playin' hooky, and truin
And some say that we lookin' like new gents
But money talks, and it don't look like y'all fluent
And y'all done seen how this ""Young'n"" look in the new pints
But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints
(Verse 3 - Fabolous)
Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way
Even though I feel like the same old John J.
Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray
When I eat, I order the same old entree
When I ride, I let the same old songs play
And when I work, I do the same old long days
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way
They know where we came, from the name they call me
I already know what these lames is gonna say
And I already seen what games they gonna play
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way
And when you die, y'all crackers gonna blame it on strays
(Mary J. Blige)
Cause love and life, and life and livin'
Your very special
(*Harmonizing*)
[Chorus] - w/ variations
(*Harmonizing*)
Me and Fab are very special

Me and Fab are very special"

Yeah, me a clock every time I check
Niggas don't measure up, and try and blame the Pyrex (Damn)
I'ma do it bigger than a 5 X
Can't ride with an L, so I don't drive Lex
Game so bickery
So full of trickery
Nursery rhyming, hickory-dickory

Oh, it's my time
My time is more like fly time
Don't call it gettin' dressed, call it in a sky time
If you ain't a pilot, you probably couldn't style it
Unless you was a stewardess, you won't know what to do with this
First I take the time out
Then I put the time in
Money ain't everything, it's more about the timing
So I got the Audemar
Flawless diamonds
In other words that's called perfect timing
I feel like I'm favored
I feel like a savior
They clockin my neck, I feel like I'm Flava
I go so hard
Loso god-damn
Street Fi-di-di-di-dam
'09, all mine
It's been a few years now it seem bout time
You know I got committed with it since I been up in the zone
Sign the dotted liiiine now its on
So y'all better check your wrist piece
Why? Cause its time to make history
Since I been here up on this here street
Howda, howda, howda hell you gon' evict me?
You know I'm here stay, never clockin' out
Big bottles we poppin' now
No telling when we stopping now
And I represent the Chic-A-G-O
On the track with F-A-B-O
You know we"
86,Never Duplicated,2003,Street Dreams (2003),,Fabolous,"Uh, yes I am often imitated
But I am never duplicated, yeah
Yes I am often imitated
But I am never duplicated
I can't deny it, you's a dick rider
You can never flow like me, blow like me
Why would a bitch like ya?
She can see that I'm a fuckin' rider, you a hitch hiker
I'm walkin' in some shoes, they can't make fit ya
Got millions of paper that you can't take with ya
I don't wanna talk and I can't take pictures
Listen to your demo, I'll handshake with ya
Excuse you, who's you?
If I need a stunt double I'll use you
Pardon y'all, I don't wanna step on y'all toes
Seperate the authentic from the replica flows
And the kid be places you could never be at
So that can never be this, and this can never be that
These niggaz got some audacity
Sell some records as fast as me
Or sell some tickets out as fast as me
Motherfucker
Yes I am often imitated (yes he is often imitated)
But I am never duplicated (but he is never duplicated)
So all that y'all can do is hate it
None of these wannabes really come close
I feel like I'm watchin the MTV show Christina Milian hosts
Everybody know this brother got it
Way before everybody and their mother got it
They still wonder how he sound like he do
If I was you, I'd wanna sound like me too
'Cause I got M's, they got G's and they all right
But they not me
They hear how I spit it on a station
Now they wanna put me on they singles just to get an imitation
No, I can't make an appearance
Give you a cheap fee or break on a clearance
I'm what your label hoped it could be
That's why they trying to mould your little ass, into a sculpture of me
With the ladies it'll be like leader, she like real
Y'all trying to be like me and be like ill
So all that y'all can do is hate it
I'm real
It's the way I talk, the way I walk
It ain't my fault
I won't let nothin' on two legs stop me
'Cause the real is always better than the bootleg copy
Like I ain't show 'em the white and yellows at the same time
Throw backs and pin wheels at the same time
Like I'm scared to drop at the same time
I'll show you how to do this young'n
I ain't frontin'
These Jordan's ain't comin'
It ain't nothin'
Keep the complaints comin'
Can't hop on my bandwagon
Jump in my blue flames
You should not try, you are not I
It's the dude with the Grammy grin
It's no relation if it ain't a street family kin
So won't the real Fabolous please stand up
Please stand up
Please stand up
So all that y'all can do is hate it"
87,Never Let It Go,2009,Loso's Way (2009),,Fabolous,"(Chorus - Keys)
If only I could see you again
I will make sure that those days never end
If only I could do it all again
Just to have one more chance
I'll never let it go
(Fabolous talking over Chorus)
I mean life's not like that though
Sometimes you only get one shot
Most times, yeah
(Verse 1 - Fabolous)
Don't you hate a could of, would of, should of nigga?
Could of did, would of did, well you should of nigga (nigga)
I am never on the iffy shit
You see her with me, you ain't gotta wonder if he hit
My daddy was a player too, Ken Griffey shit
He said kill these hoes and get the death certificates (haha)
So when I do me, I over do it
In the red Rover sendin bitches over to it
Might use the Caddy, part-time golfer
But act now I'm a limited time offer
And I'm off the, chain like a stray dog
If I want it, I'm a fetch it, I don't play dog (I don't play dog)
I see the game from a sick angle
New York had a chance, the bitch pick Tango
In my case you get one opportunity
Minus convertible, so let's call it drop-tunity, haha
(Verse 2 - Fabolous)
Get a slice of the pie now, you wait till the pizza's cold
Then you sayin' what you +Shoulda+ did like Keyshia Cole
+I Should Have Cheated+ (nah), I +Shoulda Let You Go+ (nah)
I just shake 'em off (yeah), Etch A Sketch a ho (haha)
I draw a blank, back to the drawing board
I'm like Michael Jordan if we talkin' scorin broads (damn)
To me you got one chance to miss ya shot (yeah)
Better get ya J up (yeah), life is not a layup (nah)
Meanin', sometime they make it hard
Like a straight dude, naked broad get on top of me
Why give an inch if she can take a yard? (woo)
You land on ""Chance,"" take a card, it's Monopoly
I think past ""Go"" (yeah), 200 on my mental dash though
And my foot is on the gas ho
If opportunity ain't there, make one
They ain't give me a chance, so I had to take one, Los'
(Fabolous talking over Chorus)
Niggaz be lookin' at shit that's right in front of 'em man
They don't even see their chance is right in front of 'em
You know? It's fucked up
(Verse 3 - Fabolous)
I look at Obama and I more than glance
I don't just see change, I saw a chance
How many hustlers do you know waitin for a chance?
Some pedal more than Lance in the Tour de France
How many convicts inside waitin for a break?
That's rare, short time, waitin for a steak
How many shooters holdin' heat, waitin for a shot?
Fall asleep in the car waitin for a shot
Sniper's in D.C., I know what he see
I'm tryin' to put you on to it, Cici
Just ate fried chicken, I took greasy
I told this bitch I'm a Mac/Mack not a P.C. (haha)
I sit niggaz down, don't let 'em stand a chance
Only way you squares ride is a ambulance
Kill 'em while you got a chance in a Bronco
Or it comes back in the end, Benny Blanco, yes

This the Triangle Offense
Ghetto Fab

We all ""Street Dreams""
At one time or another
Fast cars, cash
Money, hustlin...
C'mon y'all
Desert Storm
(Chorus - Paul Cain)
Some niggas thug, and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas'll rob, and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got shit, some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time, and some live as a snitch
(Verse 1 - Paul Cain)
Now some niggas like to pull out and talk, some niggas pop off
Some niggas found they way to the top, some niggas got lost
Some niggas keep it thorough in jail, some niggas got soft
Some niggas ride hard top Coupe, I pull the top off
And quick to speed off on the jake
Quick to back, any nigga gettin' money, come up off of the safe
Fuck the city, I'm extortin the state
I'm like O. from the ""Wire"", walk wit a sawed-off and a .8
When I was taught, never talk wit a snake
When you kill a nigga you love, you pay for the coffin and weight
Get you wrapped up, and tossed in a lake
If you can't get the whole pie, just take ya portion and skate
Don't fuck wit niggas, if they soft or they fake
Only jail cats, and niggas going back and forth to court could relate
Fuck wit me, and I'ma alter ya fate
Send some wolves after ya girl, I specialize in torture and rape
We in the game most dudes ain't built for
Cain talk the type of shit, niggas get killed for
Whatever it's gon' be, let it be, I ain't waistin a slug
And time is money, and when it come to mind, take it in blood, nigga

Some niggas thug, and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas rob, and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got nothin', some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time, and some live as a snitch
(Verse 2 - Fabolous)
These niggas act like, I ain't sling the clip at the last lane
And ran to the cops, to bring the tips of the last names (Nigga!)
Like I ain't bring the shipments, and past caine
And sticky that'll leave ya finger tips wit the grass stains (Nigga!)
Like I don't swing and zip through the fast lane
Would you believe, this ringer chipped me a fast Range (Nigga!)
Like I ain't sling on stips, till my past fame
And stacked it up, like the Pringle chips, when the cash came (Nigga!)
Like I ain't fling and dip, when the task came
I knew these niggas sing like pits, so I stash change
The singles chipped in my ass changed
But this player never pay for, them rings and whips, just to gas dance
I'm why you stay in touch wit ya writer
Even made you pick up ya pen, and start clutchin it tighter
I ain't much of a fighter
But I know, everything about rollin' up, like a Dutch in a Spyder
My dope is much more than whiter
One hit'll have the fiends yellin' out, they need crutches and lighters
The Fed's can't touch us indict us, and the hoes can't even get numbers
They wanna stay in touch, they could write us, nigga

Listen, listen, I lived that life, of click-clack life
The kidnap life, the kid's the wise, I did that twice!
You prolly see that through ya bitch ass eyes
Still I'm that nigga that you get at why
Man forget that they knew me, remember me thug
I'm from that same block, rips snorkle on ja dip in a Lucy
'Member they back you down, when knives was out
.45 was out, scully ya eyes come out
But now could you hear nigga all in this place
That when you see him in the streets, you gettin' all in his face
More you give a nigga, the more that he takes, and you wanna beef
Knowin' I'm slower than do so, 'cause I got much more at stake
HUH!?... that's why I'm ignorin ya page
I can't respect you no more, you's a fraud and a snake
But you noticed that's the hate that I love
You see me eating off rat, that same feat you think you capable of
Don't get me worng, I would like to get it
But you acting like, I ain't blow my show money on a rifle fetish
And my pop's voluntarily, surrendered to the Fed's
This is the wrong time to fuck wit my head
I'm tryna tell you, friends are ya worst enemies
So if I make friends wit my worst enemies, that'll maybe even things out
But one in ya dome is easy, get it on if need be
Chrome for sheezy, please, DON'T believe me

Hope you chumps been walkin' with armor on,
Somethin's turnin' his momma on,

Bet it look plump when you got pajama's on,
Jump in, let's hit the Bahama's ma',
And it's crunk whenever I'm on the song,

I'm in a throwback so old,
It'll make your grandma glance,

Half of my roots is Dominican,
Faboloso! Me gusta le benjamins

Gotta be careful, I could pull a thick of the age
Chick on the stage, and winde up, sick in a cage
When I come through, it's usually in Dickies that's beige
Pushing a ""Eleanor"", like I'm Nicholas Cage
And it's funny how a few bucks can
Get you put under a white sheet, like you in the Ku Klux Klan
It's Street Fam' for life, we ride to the death
We play hard dog, don't cry to the rest

Others waited till I came through, short willing the Maybach

Still tucking and letting the fo' spray
Still ducking where ever the po's lay

A couple'll lift a detective
And make sure the legs that he used to walked with is defective
All you niggas do is sit on blocks and jive
About who's the baddest bitch and if Pac's alive

With a button that make the roof flip back like pocket knives
I can't knock ya drive, you feelin' like Rocky
Till you get a beatin' like he got in Rocky 5

To open they legs wider than a field goal post
Broke niggas don't wanna stand my grind so they knock it
Think my jeans got Mickey D's signs on my pockets
The hydro combined with, the chocolate have ya eyes
Lookin' like the tall dude who signed with the Rockets
The flow is so sick, sooner or later
These niggas gonna need barf bags bigger than golf bags
The coke get flew on planes monthly
And cops search me for weapons harder than they do in Hussein country
And any chick that get a view of the chain wit me

But now shit with these skios changed
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange
Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain
Be saying ""That's nasty,"" wouldn't give me no brain
Y'all surprised F-A-B-O's sane
In my rolla life, I done jumped in and out of 3, 4 lanes
I'm still here
My momma used to tell me
""Son, you're gonna make it one day, it'll happen""
Who knew I'd have what it takes,
To be famous and one day I'd be rappin' - no
My papa used to ask me ""Son, are you prepared?
Cause one day it could happen""
I dreamed about this game,
But who would of believed that one day I'd be trapped in - no
I just want some peace of mind
Niggas will risk havin' cuffs on their wrists
For this masterpiece on mine
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined
But on a small island, too far for police to find
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined
I gotta make sure my niece is fine
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time
Some be like ""At least you signed""
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines
All y'all can see if every piece be dime
And I be gettin' Nikes before they even get released sometime
Youngsters, don't let these videos ease your mind
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time
Feel me
Sometimes I wish I could go way back when
I could walk through and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson
Everything was OK back then
Now everybody playin' a cool role and I know they actin'
I gotta go back through my ol' way packin
These wolves know my jewels is filled with O'Shea Jacksons
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s
And I'm the one the PO's stay trackin
Plus I got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin
These hoes may crack grins
But I swear to God I won't never take O.J's actions
If I would've let this flow stay packed in
I'd probably be with Nick and 'Rome, spending my whole day shacked in
For now I just roll on those eight Jacksons
Till Clue and Duro brings those gray plaques in
Yeah
One day it'll happen
That One day I'd be rappin'
No
One day it could happen
One day I'd be trapped in
No"

My definition of love must differ his
I mean every friendship has its differences
But these Young Bucks remind me of Fif and his
They hear the good life, wanna see what the difference is
Some just wanna smoke, enjoy the piff-vileges
He unwrap a cigar like it's a gift of his
He a funny lil' nigga like Eddie Griffin is
Between smokin' and chokin' then you got to live
So I gave him a chance and that's a lot to give
We posed to make the most of what you was paid to gross
I gave you bread and butter, you supposed to make the toast
Fifteen years, fifteen years

How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you?

There's a parallel path 'tween friends and enemies
And whenever you cross it you make frienemies
There's no remedies for these sick memories
My doctor said there's no cure for the Emmalese
Had a crush on you, now we Kim and Cease
We don't even talk no more, it's no biggie
I was so Biggie, you was Faith
I let you slide in my home, you was safe
I thought my ability to provide you stability
Was what was really G, okay, silly me
I was Billy D, smooth cappa really street
Really, she attract niggaz like the A Milli beat
And I happen to rap but somethin' 'bout this beat strange
Soon as I try to flow with it the beat change
Never thought she'd change
But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change
Love changes

Just niggaz with chains on tryna be S.F.
That's when your ace become ya B.F.F.
Pa-pa-pachange like they was a P.F. chef
Da-da-da-danger, it just feels mystikal
I miss the cool nights sittin' in the Coll-O
Now it's like, boo, we sittin' in Apollo
It used to be all good then, shit just went mile low
And that's bad, matter fact that's sad
'Cause when you lose a friend it's hard to handle the loss
They do some bitch shit, gotta give ya man a divorce
End up watchin' Friends like Joey, Chandler and Ross, ya see
Most of these niggaz ain't never love 'em
And these bitches just think whatever of 'em
So maybe playin' dumb was kinda clever of 'em
And less friends are your best friends become strangers

I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a f-ck
Rather hold my high and die then live and duck
If you're cool being taken down and giving up
Your lifestyle's a blow job, the way you're living sucks!
I done felt pain, waited but no help came
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain
Ever been told ""go to hell"" and felt flames
The water's to your neck and only gets deeper
It's all down hill and it only gets steeper
Gotta get over it, be a hurdle leaper
It cost to be the boss, it ain't get no cheaper
But there's a man above that we all under bro
No bread truck but he work wonders though!
After you wake up, everything is wonderful
You can overcome anything you undergo
As an artist I'm just tryna paint the perfect picture
But see where tryna wait for somebody that's perfect gets you
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses
And I be tryna cut, surgeon bitches
Dreams of splurging riches, pretty but curvy misses
Chef to serve the dishes, driving to swerve the ditches
I'm just another kid on the purple wishes?
And the streets is tough, on the verge of viscious
So I sold weed and crack, business
That white girl helped a nigga, Fergalicious
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses
So when you killin' shit watch out for the murder witness
An old head told me, let nothing disturb your business
Beef is only good when you in the burger business
So I chilled, but loaded up the steal
Like I wish a nigga would, But I know a nigga will
But for real you loaded up to kill
Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will
And I don't owe these niggas nothing
Put that in a nigga will"

Cop: All right there ah buddy license and registration
Fab: Uh officer is there a problem man what's going on?
Cop: Yeah, I had a report of a UFO
Fab: what's that?
Cop: An unidentified Ferrari looking object flying by me on the highway
Cop: you know how fast you were going?
Fab: nah not at all man
Cop: you must have been going pretty damn fast because my radar is over there smoking buddy
Cop: keep your hands where I can fucking see 'em too
Cop: I heard about you in the paper, I know you got the toaster strudel (mumbles)
Cop: yeah I need some backup over here I've got two rap singers
(Fabolous)
I wonder briefly
Could it be there's no roof above me
Or the 22's underneath me
That's keepin' them sirens flashin on my ass
Should I get to pumpin the brakes or mashin on the gas?
I'm naturally harassed
And I feel like I'm getting punked... but I don't see Ashton in the grass
Nor is there a camera stashed into the dash
It's a guy in a uniform and a passion that he has
For flashin wit his badge
And shining light in my face
Plus he keep his right hand right by his waist
The wrong move will get a gun right in my face
And they fighting for my life... I'm fighting the case
And I ain't trying to be the story they twist in the press
Like: the young man resisted arrest
Then he started reaching for something that looks like a pistol I guess
So I pulled on a nigga I mean I pulled on the trigger... figures
(Hook: Nate Dogg)
I go around the corner what do I see?
Po Po's followin me
Askin for my ID whos car I'm driving
Po Po's botherin me
Got me in a lineup, got my hands in cuffs
They don't wanna set me free
Trying to bring me down, when they come around
Po Po's fuckin' with me
(Cain)
Awe shit the jakes are fucking with me again
They hate to see me rich, they'd rather see me stuck in the pen
Everytime they walk or pull up beside me
Flash lights in my face askin for my registration and ID
I don't know the reason for the harassment
And the questions they askin
Or the ice grills they get when I'm passin
Or maybe it's my fault
'Cause I be out all times at night
Doin' shit I know I shouldn't plus I don't be ridin' right
Smokin' lye... no stash box for me to put the skit
Two warrants, no license and I ain't got insurance yet
I keep a hammer close because foes wanna stick me up
But keep my movement swift because Po's wanna frisk me up
Since '94 I've been told on by 50 descriptions
And in 10 years not once did they get a conviction
These pigs shouldn't provoke a rider
I'm so tired, they got one more time to fuck wit me before I open fire

Ones for the money and twos for the show
Three must be for the motherfuckin po po'
I've seen ghetto kings fall to the floor

Vanilla aroma to cover the back with the tree scent
The way I ride I know I'm in for a case
But the coupe do 200 so they in for a chase
When it comes to lawyers I got the man Puff uses
That's why you never seen my wrists with handcuff bruises
I got them hollow tips... to stick up in the AR's
Detectors in the dash... to pick up on the radar
Stash box in it when I purchased the vehicle
So I don't have a problem wit you searching the vehicle
They probably want to scoop an arrest
I try to throw shots but its cool, I got a coupe like a vest
And 'em troopers will just feel stupid I guess
The slugs will bounce off like they hittin superman's chest... nigga

Hey shorty, we can do it real playa like
We can go a few places that you say you like
See what a day is like when you be my a-alike
Girl just lay back, I'll do it the way you like

You need to leave them burgers alone and make a steak upgrade
I'm filet mignon with a tape-up fade
I see things clear through these Mark Jacob shades
Like the clarity in these jewels that Jacob made
You sleep better knowin' you gon' wake up paid
Hairstyle, nails filed, makeup made
We can shock South Beach, shake up Dade
In a droptop Phantom with the Drakov blades
I'ma stop by the barber, you can hit the shops in the harbor
Then get the chops or the lobster
Prime on 12, dinner for dos
We, begin with a toast, end with a dose
Of the light green cheeba, rolled in a Cohiba
It's Sunday, so you know the Forge is
Weather gorgeous, not a cloud in the sky
We can show the world how to be fly, yessss

If you want to act Hollywood fine, but shorty let's do it
When we sittin' on the hills like the Hollywood Sign
And every man lies, but not every man flies
Privately to Van Nuys
Range on the runway, driver to pop doors
Straight to Barney's, somethin' we need to stop for
She like, ""It's early - what we gonna shop for?""
How 'bout green grass breakfast, top floor
Later on Fred C, or Max Fields
Real playa like dress, good black heels
No 'Hanas, we can do Katana's
You, me, and ooh-wee marijuana
Then slide through Hyde, might include Mood
Maybe go to Area, if it's in the area
The Friday's young, try things my way hon
Malibu ride, highway 1

Nothing is too much, everything you touch turns to gold

Girl you are so...

Ay shorty
Bring the Maybach, we got a long way to go
Just lay back, you had a long day, I know
And they whack, do it the wrong way, I know
I play back but have the song playin' low
While - we six-deuce and let you fix Goose
In a glass with some ice, maybe mix some juice in
On the way to L.I., well I, coulda took the hell-eye
But we do more behind wheel
Hampton home, two floors for nine mill'
Real playa like two doors from Seinfeld
White marble, new floors that shine still
And the help keep food stored, wine chilled
Hey, you gotta live one day right (right)
Well how 'bout from Friday to Sunday night?
Then back 'fore they notice back up in Lotus
Let the world know we back and we focused~!"

I hardly see my moms, but she know her son is somewhere grindin
Some where rhymin, or somewhere climbing
Out of a pottable 760, inclasable very sticky
Wit a handgun, to send these cowards to Heaven quickly
I ain't pussy, so I won't allow you to ever dick me
I know these greaseballs, wonder how could they ever stick me
But I move, like the President through town
Wit stones the size of earrings, in my Presidential crown
I put hollows from the Desert into clowns, cause the cemetery
Is where most of the dudes, that are hesitant are found
So I take the time, of whatever the bench throw
The 4BM put down, in a seventy-two inch hole
Mean while getting adapted, to the fame has be hectic

And the girls more than like you, when you running run
Doing world tours like Michael, but girl's sure don't like you

I'm on a mission to get richer, it's as simple as that
I make it obvious, when I pick up a pencil and rap

And these verses, are like the hollow point I sent through yo back
I get you murdered if I think you a wrap
'Cause if you don't show loyalty, then that show me where ya principles at
And you don't know how much I been through, in fact
I never did like you, I ain't even gon' pretend wit you cats
And I'm the nicest, I ain't gotta say it twice and repeat it
I'm a lyrical genius, I never been beated, defeated
I'ma draw my weapon and squeeze it, you better believe it
Leave you parapaligic, I demand respect and I mean it
My Desert's the meanest, you probably dead if you seen it

When you in the kinda truck that I push up to the joint
'Cause theses motherfuckaz will push him to the point
That you'll end up locked down doin' push ups in the joint
But they'll box you in the corner
And you can throw ya fists up and act like you a boxer on his corner
Ride wit ya gun in your glove box instead of on ya
You'll be six feet deep in one of them boxes if you wanna
Not me, I squeeze the clips drop from the handle
Till your remains is in a urn on top of the mantle
Till everybody scramble off the block like they Randall (run)
Till there's a murial on your block and some candles
Who wanna die?
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
'Cause I'ma have to kill someone just to get some respeck
My teflons will have you screamin like wyclef jean (someone please call 9-1-1)
But if they ever get the watch on my left arm
Ima have more bury than that guy stephon
First they put that white seed over you brother
Then the newspapers put you all over the cover
Then you in a suit one hand cross over the other
Next you in the earth with the dirt over you brother
A tinted hearse is what most men leave in
Followed by a limo full of family and close friends greavin
When you pull the marijuana
Ima wanna kill you as bad as The Terminator wanted Sarah Connor
But I'm loosin my patience
Fuck it send me to the island I could use a vacation
Now it's easy for me to understand
How you could just kill a man
I'd rather be judged by twelve
Than carried by the six
My gun ain't on my man, or carried by my chicks
My gun ain't in my crib or carried in the six
If I'm right here nigga, then this right here nigga
Picture me putting my hearse
Like I ain't gotta a clip full a hollow tips to put in these jerks
I might as well put in the work
Spit 'em up outta herre and get 'em up outta here
I got the juice like bishop had wit him
That just don't give a fuck, semi
Like ol' dog had wit him
I'm sayin' prayers for my enemy
I hope god bless him before the fucker run into me
I dunno, what the fuck has got into me
But I know I don't want them slugs goin' into me
I'm just tryin' to live my life
So niggaz better give me my respect or give me life
Look what you made me do man
Look what you made me do man
I didn't want it to come to the right
But fuck it...
Niggaz will push you to that point man
Niggaz will play with you so much man
Aggravate you so much man
That you wanna kill a nigga man
Yeah"

Ay it's a new year, and I'm back for new money
Just I think I left somethin' (JUST BLAZE!)

Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M.
It's a new year, dolla dolla bill y'all, yup!
Get that money yup! Dolla dolla bill y'all, yup!
Get that money yup! Dolla dolla bill, yup yup!
(Fabolous)
Yesss - it's the return of the young hustle
A nigga came for the money, not the tongue tussle
Me I'd rather do my lip lashin, when the chips cash in
Then you might see me on the strip flashin
Like Vegas lights, and they say I shine Vegas bright
Draw a crowd like a Vegas fight
So shiiiiiiit, gettin' hit in my leg is like
I mean it coulda been a 2Pac vegas night
Or maybe a Notorious L.A. evening
""Baby you okay?"" I mean well I'm breathin
Hell I'm even, bossin and I left
The money ain't right then I toss you to the left
Yesss, to the left, to the left
Everything is hustle to the death for the F-
-A-B baby, they be lazy
Gucci straightjacket 'cause I may be crazy
Loony for the loot, psycho for the paper
This a new year but I recycle for the paper
If green talks, then I'm the Geico with the paper
So have my check right, no typos with the paper please
(Chorus - repeat 2X w/ ad libs, end first time end with ""I said"")

That's why they money go, quicker than a crack high
My money stack high, how high? Shaq high
Yao high, that's why, yours is Bow Wow high
You lookin' at your new hustle, like your last hustle
Was looked at as Russell, in my past hustle
Shorty work it, she be on her ass hustle
She make it clap, she know how to work them ass muscles
Fast rush you, then back to the money
They say I'm frontin, can't turn my back to the money
And truthfully you're cool but I'm attracted to money
So why don'tcha turn your back to the money and let it shake
I'm lovin' how you move that smooth, you let it snake
But players don't chase at it baby we let it make
Bet it make sense when you make them dollars
I ain't gotta make them move, but I make them holla
This my year, but y'all can help me celebrate
I'm 9:15, that means I'm hella straight
Swizz stacks, Just Blaze bucks
I'm back for my money, it's just they luck

Last nigga that talked slick and been replyin' since
Got a deal, No sellin', Been supplyin since
Leave niggas on the ground like tire prints
We done make ya eyes look bent, Just by the sense
These niggas don't believe, Then they gone die convinced
Once I present the four fifth why comment
I'm the type you tell ya dame bout
Push a fellow brain out

This is why they f-ck with me: right after the head
I tell 'em I gotta leave 'cause I'm trying to stay sucker-free
They say I'm a dog, well that makes them a f-cking flea
And now I understand why their ass is so stuck on me
Luckily, I be feeling good in my bucket seats
Thug Motivation: my coupe cost a buck 03
Mind of a hockey player: you could suck a D
I'ma reach my goal and you ain't gon take this puck from me
Coco Loso in my Stanley Cup
You could say whatever, just don't bring the family up
Who could f-ck with me? Everybody hand be up
But when we set the date, bet these niggas stand me up
I'm down to earth like gravity, but man we up
Women get around me and they cannot keep their panties up
Your boy drop jewels, you niggas should ante up
This is food for thought, you bitches fill the pantry up
As I get older, I be looking at what rap breeds:
A bunch of tatted up niggas who can wrap weed
And I ain't saying I""m exactly what rap needs
I'm just a swagged-out nigga in a Rapide
With a 3-year old, that I'm trying to be here for
Road to the riches, and my gift is my vehicle
And I ain't even talking about that Aston Martin
Even though I bought that for my birthday
The lines I come up, they pass the margin
Yeah, I write my best shit on my worst day
And that's the shit that gets you richer
Turn a negative into a positive: get the picture?
People say I changed; it's not me, it's the money

It's so funny how I suit the women
They know I'm still spendin show money from ""Superwoman""
They like ""where'd he get those twenties?""
And ""I didn't know that's a color that the coupe could come in, damnit man""
All I say to the heffers is ""Jesus""
Keep swallowin my kids, mights as well have no nephews and nieces
I know you wanna sip Proof
And try an make me crack a smile, just so you can see my chipped tooth

Just to get, in and out of your womb
And the rocks in mine glare, somethin' like Times Square
Excuse me miss, you want me to sign where? (sign where?)
Fab's hard to be found
But most likely I'm with a foreign dame who name's hard to pronounce
I started out, gettin' hard by the ounce
No more cash in stashes, it's cards in accounts
The way I make 'em nod to the bounce
Somebody call Silvia and tell her ship larger amounts
This playa make 'em scream a scheme
My closest look like I keep gettin' traded from team to team
Look sleezy, it's difficult but me and Tim the only ones that make pimpin'
Look easy
Tell me how I'm gonna make my album cleaner
With bitches suckin me up like vacuum cleaners
Even chickens wanna cluck outside

And when I said my rims was only nineteens, she said ""stop lyin'!""

First Verse, Fabolous:
Slow down baby, let me be your yellow light
The way we met is wrong, let me say hella-right
You need a yellow light, a break from this ghetto life
The way I roll make the haters want them yellow dice
She said what matters is that Gucci, plus stilettos nice
And when you slap this ass, it shake like Jello, right?
What I like, roll them cigarellos tight
I nicknamed her big chicken and yellow rice
Pretty brown skin, long blonde hair
She know they talking but she never gon' care
'Cause when you roll with trash-talkers
That's what you gon' hear
I can't imagine what fall upon Lebron's ear.
Always been the girl that didn't have to wait in line
Niggas buy her watches just for making time
They say ""give it up"" I never had to ask
Call her the stick up girl that never wore a mask
Baby, ain't you tired of life in this fast lane?
Packing luggage, rushing, trying to catch the last plane?
There's some dudes who take pride in trying to gas dames
The same dudes will see her and give they last name
Funny how I became the apple of her eye
She's from the South and I'm a rapper from NY
Don't get me wrong: lil mama love ""Trap or Die""
But through it all she kept her watch on the dapper guy
And fell in love with a 2009 verse
She said before we met, I fucked her in her mind first
We crossed paths, a mixture of karma and luck
I walked in strong, mentally calming my nuts
I got 'em swarming and stuck, she call me illin cut
You know me I can spot a swan from a duck
My approach? Smoother than an Armani tux
The diamonds going off like the alarm on a truck
Small talk, warming her up, palming her cup
She told me I make her laugh and I'm charming as fuck
But for now she had to go, the chat just quickly changed
She was chilling, now she leaving, that was kinda strange
Asked ""can we meet again?"" She said ""that can be arranged""
And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged
We did, she slid and that will be explained
But for now she hopped into a Platinum-colored Range"

Snakes in the grass, so I stay in the pavement
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I'm all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth cosed, you wanna know why you die
The answer's right under your nose
Exposed to the street, in the game I don't cheat
I just play my position, get MVP
I get money, don't shit come free
It's my life and I run it even when
Keep my business in my pockets, don't wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me
See?
(Fabolous - Verse 2)
Say what's on your heart if you're real
Cause the scars you can't see be the hardest to heal
And I used to chase money, now I have it brought
Cause you can only chase something that you haven't caught
If there's a summertime in hell, it's not as hot
You empty clip niggas ain't got a shot
These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore
Now you decide if their to die for
Advice to my haters, do what I say now
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down
Thought it was love, how foolish of us
I do me, she do her, sometimes we do eachother
(Lil Wayne - Verse 3)
Look, as the crooked World revolves
Love spelt backwards is evol (evolve)
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live
And when death comes you better have lives to give
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs
And rats die ugly, die with kids
These niggas is snitching and still living
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches
Niggas pretend like they actually in
But when it go down they f-ck around and be them
That blood look familiar when it's leaking
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga
That ain't love
(Fabolous - Verse 4)
Life is but a dream
Ain't always what it seems
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!
I see these haters in passing, yeah they 'round
I be on the way up, they be on the way down

It's 'cause the streets is watching with an envious ear, jealous eye
You know how William H. Bonnie's rockin'
I keep the home selling two way contact like Johnny Cochran
Be the same dudes, testing your patience
In them hospitals, resting like patients, confessing to agents
You smell me, you gotta spray the Wesson like fragrance
And you pay your way out arrests and arraignments

What type of bad guy give fellas death, females hugs?
I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs
I get threats over the two way from email thugs
I ride with ratchets, clips under the CL rugs
Think I'm liking you? Wrong
'Cause even if I get locked, my money won't let me stay unrighteous for long
Case dismissed, the DA even liking the song
Right back to the P's, latest pair of Michael's shoes on
When you holla in the club, it's cool
But don't change the subject fool
And start askin if I remember you from public school
You know I done heard dozens of these birds buzzing
Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin

Somebody talk to me, muthafuck rappin'
They infiltrated the game, but who let in the pookies?
Kingpins is snitchin that shit is not lookey
So fuck new friends unless they stay solo
'Cause who gon' watch you back after you kill Manolo?
Isn't it ironic Santana's own fella stabbed him
The king of New York die while I yellow cabbed him
No Carlito's way
When I spot a hater drop him like a hot potatoe
Youahead, got me later
Yeah I keep it gangsta but I'm'ma do it my way
The new day of the week is called My day
So it's my say, Pass my K

Ain't no tellin' what this hip lowered do to me
I'm feelin' like I can do what I want now
Dip-low immunity
Shorty! just shake your hips slow and move wit me
Take a hit of this and sip slow and thoroughly
You're sneakin' out on your man, tip-toein' to the V
'Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe
Let's put on a live strip show just you and me
But girl, I'm lookin' at them lips though like who is he?
They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry
So when I ask you wanna leave the zip-code?
Say sure and be me
But this is my party
Stroll by if you want to
Or y'all can stay home
But why would you want to?
We gon' party, till we laid in graves
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves
Then scream hey-hey-hey yo
That groupie made her wait
'Cause when she seen the whips and chains
She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon
This is my party
So fly if you like to
Get high if you like to 'cause I know you like to
Put your hands up as high as you like to
And it feels good scream hey-hey-hey yo
I don't know about y'all
But we doin' it over here
All the glasses got liquid that's blue in it over here
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this
You see why we asks is to see ID
'Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access
Me I relax this (easy)
'Cause I'm used to ballin'
You could tell that these guys need practice
But if it was a problem then I would confront you
You saying over bet ya eyes say you want to
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books
Oh yeah, we's off the Richter Scale
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail
The Street Family speed off in six SL's
To all them chicks at Yale hey-hey-hey-hey yo
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view
Girl I know that these guys say they want you
I wake up in the same clothes from yesterday
Same hoes from yesterday
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday
Her hang-overs yesterday
You ain't mistaken' we in Benz's today
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday (now say it)

Where the fuck's all these niggas saying Ran' isn't hot
I damage the block
I scramble like Randall with rocks
I'm that nigga in the gambling spot
Cracking jokes and drinking liquor
You still gotta hand me your watch
I'm in the kitchen with the pans and the pots
Razor on the plate, trying to figure out how many grams I'm a chop
Family or not, some niggas making plans with the cops
Trying to figure how to make this animal stop
Who these niggas trying to take down
Break down, tray pound, eight rounds
He ain't feeling nothing from the waist down
Hit up, lit up, he never gonna get up
There's only one legend alive
The rest you gotta dig up
You acting like it's hard roast ya
I'll creep in your crib, and put your brains on your Barkley posters
Got no time to be boxing around
I got the ox and the pound
I'll leave you in the box in the ground
Got the keys to the game, and we locking this down
Underwater with the sharks, and we not gonna drown
Got the order from the narcs, they still watching the town
I'm copping a pound
They ain't no stopping us now, my nigga
Ya clip trip, clip spit
Get your strip wet
I got the rubber grip Smith and my rich sweats
Player haters talking 'bout they gonna get Freck
I'm in the Lamb' sunk lower than the shipwreck
They call me bar-for-bar 'cause I spit the better lines
The white bitch got rich like Federline
Fuck a g-pack, I'll show you how to read crack
You get it soft and then you rock it like T-Mac
The weed good price, plus it smoke speci
Three thousand full pound of some Dro pesci
Y'all niggas only talkers
I'll let my homies spark ya
We in the spurs, that's faster than Tony Parker
This is family nigga don't ever cross my brother
Like Big Worm, niggas rather cross their mother
Mention names in my family tree
This nigga talking crazy like insanity plea
I, swear to god, the next nigga I give it to
Is going to a place FedEx can't deliver to
I'm West Philly Freck, yeah I get dirty
I'm the best, hands down, like six-thirty
Look
Like Michael J. Fox, I got +Family Ties+
Posing us can't be wise
Swept across the family dies
Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside, hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop, or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary, determined the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em, but I'm no painter
To this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers
You dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the dutch
Leave you broke up on a crush
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gonna body you, and have to hook your wife to an I.V. too
Put both of your parents side by side in I.C.U (everybody lose)
Closed casket so they can't have a proper wake
Don't interfere with family business, that's how we operate
Yo
Niggas is letting birds turn the tables on they squad
Need help with a jump, got some cables in the car
'Cause they all become nondescript
When something bright is on your wrist
Like you repping the bionic six
Who wanna fire, when guns fire, your lungs tire
I'm an idol, niggas is Sanjaya, now who wanna try us
That four-five will spit
I'll slump you in the driver seat
And make you really ghost ride the whip
It's real talk, shade niggas couldn't get a tan from me
'Cause I get in the ring for that Vince McMahon money
Soon as his un-tuck BAM
Talking about you touch grams
I'm coming through your window something like +Brother Man+
It's just who we are
If I see yar, it's E.R
Vacay in D.R., shirt and jeans, g-star
Tell me how they gonna manage
Letting off Virgina Tech's now, dudes ain't even safe on campus
Gotta spaz on cowards
Every twenty-four, every half-hour
Niggas be trying to be Jack Bauer
So let fam' keep talking
You gonna need a +Weekend At Bernie's+
If you trying to see a +Dead Man Walking+
I guess it's left to me, the popcorn slinger, to pop off nigga
Callouses on my pop finger, pop off nigga
Pop through, throw the drop, kick the lock off dump
'Fore them bodies drop out, six glocks in the trunk
Chef boy supplying, whip whop is drying
When they move that, more whip whop arriving
And my connect from Phoenix, the connect named Phoenix
Still Keep the iron like my right hand anemic
For for the family, I'll be squeezing, no reason
Blood work, nobody leaving this bitch breathing
Niggas on the low, kidnapped my flow
Coulda asked for it, I woulda gift wrapped my flow
Don't gotta ask for it, I'm gonna sit back the fo'
Flip it around, let the handle crack ya jaw
Eastside, Westside, I'll be in my Converse
This a convict rapping, It's a con's verse
Arm and Hammer mis-man, 'Los, Joey, or Ris-am
All they gotta do is chirp
And them things are gonna blis-am
Shake down, fiz-am
Straight from the Brooklyn borough that never riz-an
Block-ay block-ay
Now if they get me on wire traces
I'm gonna die in comstaat
I got prior cases from riding with firearms cocked
Fire bomb box, set up by your mom's block
Go off on time, 'cause it's wired by alarm clock
I get his legs, you grab him by arms ock
We gonna go this liar harm while his crying moms watch
Last seen in Brooklyn, they found in a Bronx lot
Rifles on the roof, yeah we got him by a long shot
We don't fire warning shots, niggas fire on swat
And if they get me, Brooklyn gonna riot on spot
I'm from the hood, so I'm supplying bomb rock
'Round here that's better than buying Viacom stock
Look, you can't hold nothing, but I got a shell to give
I'll make his relative show me where the fella live
Ain't that his baby sis', get up in this Mayby' miss
Before I pull this curb and start swerving like Baby sis
If he heard yet, bet that get the word buzzing
You send a message when you kill a nigga third cousin
Niece, nephew, they gonna need Tef' too
This'll a go in and out they chest like a breath do
You Clay Aiken-soft
You playing games until this red light's on ya
It's like the Playstation's off
Smith and Wesson work, Luger nine labor
Professional shit like they did me on majors
This is family nigga, do not cross the brothers
I'll put you in the box, one hand across the other
A small price to pay, son, it might cost your mother
One of your grandparents, even your baby brother
Cause everybody knows, everybody goes
I want them in coffins, everybody's closed
Related by the streets, this is family beef
So better not touch a branch on this family tree

Ya know, Catch me if you can nigga
Uh, Haha
Throwback this, Throwback that
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
I rock the Reds Pete Rose when I'm in the 'Natti
And 4X, You can't see the semi-automatti
When I'm in the Chi' you think they ain't that shocked
To see the kid roll through in the St. Pats Socks
So pull out the Chicago and the script to wear on Soul Train
The Bulls, When Mike had hair and a gold chain
I get the Spirit in St. Louis, How could the god lose
I do back flips in the Ozzie Cardinals
They love me in Cleveland, Everytime I travel there
I'm in the Indians or that Cavaliers
When I hit Minnesota, That kid from Brooklyn wear
The Vikings or the Timberwolves from Garnett's rookie year
And in Milwaukee I had to pimp it and go back
20 years with the Bucks and Brewers throw backs
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
I might charge through San Diego with the bolts on my shoulder
Rock the Trailblazer warm-up, Cause Portland gets colder
And even the pimps be jealous
When I'm in the floor seat at the Forum in the M.P.L.S.
And they be askin' what teams on the kid chest
This the Rams before they moved to the Midwest
When I'm in the Bay with it, I don't play with it
I'm in the Athletics with the matchin' A's fitted
This ain't even for the minors
'Cause they don't know nothin' 'bout the Joe Montana, 49ers
Seattle, Probally heard different rumors
Either about the Payton or the Griffey Jr.
I come through Denver like 4th quarter with Elway
Or the Nuggets that make them yell Eh
In Pheonix I do the old Suns
Cause the new jerseys is cool, But nothings really like the old ones
Ya know
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
In New York what I wear the the club may vary
Mets or Yankees like the Subway Series
When I'm in Boston I melt the bean
In a hot Red Soxs or Celtics green
In the city of Philly, I roll up on the biddes like feel these
In a size 56 Phillies
In Jersey I got the Nets on
That you can bet on
In D.C. I couldn't pull it
Without the Bullets
When I stop in Atlanta I can't talk long
Them birds know I got the Falcons or the Hawks on
That peach Tampa Bay don't hit the streets too often
Not even Miami could take the Heat of Dolphins
Ain't no complaints on
When I'm in New Orleans with the Saints on
In Houston I pass hoes
In the Astros
In Dallas I always gotta have
The Cowboys or the Mavs
Tell Pete To keep it comin', And Imma keep it comin'
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that

You see I do's what I choose on shiny twenty-two's
Be's what I please in brand new Bentleys
That's right stupid! Soon as they couped it, I went and scooped it
Now I'm on the move, on the move
Running the City, something like Diddy
At 150, wit the gun and the CD (wow!)
Niggaz who be hunting for biddies
Never seen nothing this pretty, and they lying if they say they do
They bring the playa through like they bring the mayor through
They know the way I do is what the AK'll do
Listen here we can disappear for a day or two
Bet you come back smiling like Mase, c'mon!
Like Case say 'Touch Me, Tease Me'
But the Top Dawg tell her it must be easy
I'm in the white cut E-Veezy
Ashton Cuts be freezy, it must be easy!

See I ain't keep going tit for tat your ass ma

You see I bop to the beat of the streets since I was born
Move like they would in the hood until I'm gone
The girls know my paper denim, keep paper in em
As soon as they change the shapes I'm in em
The BAPEs they send 'em wit snake skin in em
To the kid in the city wit the scrapers in em
(Nowww!) I move to left like... then I move to the right like
They follow the need to follow my lead
Do the do then swallow my seed, like
You can leave the spot you cramped in
Lamp in the Hamptons like a champion
Refuse to choose the, use the loser
Don't let the hydro moves confuse ya
And pass on a stunner to go wit a fronter
If you wanna do the kick it then go wit a punter
(Verse - Fabolous)
You see the white's so bright it's hard to be polite
The yellow's so mellow I have to act ghetto
Hello, my name is - fuck that! I'm famous
Y'all ain't the same as, F-a to the B
I don't know what it be, baby girl could it be
You ain't see how good it be rolling wit me?
Like - get me on or get me gone
It's at least 22's that they sit me on
I'm in the Ice Cream shoes, nice gleam too
Crack the button up so the ice beam through
You could wake up wit regrets, or wake up in a jet
Fixing you hairdo in a Jacob wit baguettes girl

Fabolous, Jagged Edge, don't be fool, I'd rather have you ma'
Than everything, I'd give it all, just for you, yeah
You're the one baby girl, I've never been so sure
Your skin's so pure, the type men go for
The type I drive the Benz slow for
The type I be beepin the horn rollin' down the windows for
Never been no whore
So to get you in closed doors, I buy you everything in those stores
This and that, and those yours
As long as Fabolous the only one you let that grin show for
You ain't gotta spend no more, I'm a put a rock on your hand
You ain't gotta say ""we just friends"" no more
I shine, you shine, it never been no flaws
I ain't like most who just wanna get in those drawers
'Cause every king need a queen
And with me and you girl I ain't tryna let a thing in between
It ain't a thing, nahmean, chicks hate, show 'em the ring and the green
And let your middle finger be seen, it's on
(Chorus - Jagged Edge)
Girl I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream (my dream)
All, anything to have you on my team (I don't care baby)
All, baby girl I'd trade it all (I'd trade it, yeah)
Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring (oh yeah)
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl I'd trade it all
(Fabolous)
Uh, don't front ma', you know the way I ball's to pick and roll
Like Stockton and Malone when we play the mall
I be goin' out my way to call
'Cause I love the way your hips make your jeans seem like they too small
Them see-through tops with your titties exposed
When you kick off them shoes there ain't bitty whose toes as pretty as those
That blonde hair look good, straight down, bun or the braids
And I ain't gon' talk about them light-browns under your shades
Bust right, thus tight
Got a thick set of thighs and struts like... uh
Yo' the game taught this brother to mack
But I think I slipped when I saw them full lips covered with Mac
You got everything that others would lack
Along with the F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S
Your patience I personally admire
'Cause I started out a player now I'm 'bout to have my jersey retired, for real
There ain't no ""mights"" or ""maybe""
Had I did wrong, so I'm a make sure it's right for my baby
You know how tight that my day be
And how long and stressin them flights to L.A. be
Ain't no rumor gon' get back to your friends
Before I let a nigga disrespect you I be back in the pen
Front to back you a ten
You got me thinkin' 'bout puttin' a car seat in back of the Benz, uh"

My sweet thing, never believe them rumors that been true
In fact, I had no more expense, it's true
But you was wifey could change me into a groom in a mintue, Boo
Maybe my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they can make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you there, feel like June in December, too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter through
I don't know whatever consumes you gonna do
I put a daytime to go to Bloomies and spend with you

And there for every uw, hum, and moon and make sure when the new hummer roams
The shoes come in chrome

That send chills through a woman's bones
But life gives groove summer loans
Even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
Flights out of few summer loans
Now I wanna wake up every day with you in a new number zone
Ma-Me-ya it's you I'ma phone
Just to erase all the negative view from your dome
And I promise this Fella G
And so case they hit comma of jealousy
And drama you tellin' me

Even when I had smaller digits
The kid was never a playa hata or a baller bigot
Every week, pay 'em all a visit
I bring Pamela Lee to the P's so we all can dig it
I popped enough alcohol so we all could swig it
Guns, stand them up they be as tall as midgets
O.k, I'll rap a little faster
But do I really sound like I turned from a rapper to a pastor
I'm like you except I date supermodels
The cars that I drive, the state troopers follow
We get the same parties probably
My stones look like sunshine, yours partly cloudy
And I don't front for nothin'
I likes, I gets, I don't want for nothin'
I'm givin' y'all straight answers
And I'd rather be dead than livin' wit a hate cancer
Say what you wanna say, talk if you wanna talk
We don't give a fuck!
Look how you wanna look, grill if you wanna grill
We don't give a fuck!
Act how you wanna act, front if you wanna front
We don't give a fuck!
Live how you wanna live, try if you wanna die
We don't give a fuck!
I used to just post on the corner, roast marijuana
I'd be on the coast of Tiajuana
Bitches who look, close to Madonna,
Dosie cabanna, toast by nana
I'm 'sposed to be one of those dudes that ride in Testaroastas upon ya
Not to boast but I'm gonna, I keep toastin the armor
For niggaz who supposed to be drama
I mostly just wanna, get fed garlic toast and lasagna
Get head while I'll roast in a sawna
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S, how can you hate that?
And I ain't concerned with the scandals
'Cause it's all bullshit my attourneys can handle
Y'all insides be burnin like candles
Rippin down posters, turnin' the channels
You gonna end up in an urn on a mantle nigga, yeah
I look at these brothers and laugh
Jealous niggas don't hate havin', just others who have
I still got love for the av.,
Come through to give ya niggas girls baby mothers my math
I speak on others behalf, only hate makin' money
And gotta give the government half
You know this brother live last
And not even Mike seen Jordans in the colors I have
I used to run from undercovers like Shaft
That was until this young playa got shoved into the draft
Now I'm covered in ice, like Bruce Lee's bodies
Niggas is scared, to lose these hotties
Talk if you wanna talk, grill if you wanna grill
We don't give a fuck nigga
Front if you wanna front, try if you wanna die
If you live its luck nigga"

He's young, he's handsome
He's a poet, a prophet
And many people believe he will be the champion of the world
Welcome to my workplace
This is my ""Get Ya Ass Back To Work"" face
Bedroom storage, kitchen workspace
Stick a finger in the pot, see how the work taste
Sweet!
Call it rock candy
When you bake cakes, you keep Betty Crock' handy
They say it's best you scratch, fresh new batch
Can you smell what The Rock is cookin?
Wrestling match
1, 2, 3, ding!
We put it in the microwave, not the ring
The Vince McMahon of brick weighing
Make a wall outta them shits, brick laying
The apartments stinker than a fart sent
Like walking in Bloomingdales fragrance department
You smell fumes, from hells tomb
Then it gets moved to the back mail room
That's where it's packaged to deliver
All through the city, and right across the river
Welcome to my workplace
Better than MacCartney with the Beatles when I work base
Get it in, get it out, steady work pace
Last time it was tested, my work aced it
Dude I can't feel my faced it
Sat back like I am wasted
The J.P. Morgan of the coke business
Your moneys funny and I ain't in the joke business
Hi and bye on the phone, I never spoke business
What the fuck I do ain't these folks business
Bitches half-naked, niggas fully loaded
Speaks for itself, don't even gotta promote it
This that Loso's Way
Everybody want that Loso's Way"

Dear fab
I wrote this letter in confidence you will read it
I succeeded getting my collage education completed
Smart girl not conceded I'm used to being treated anyway
But anyway
Your advice is needed
I'm 22 years old,
With a beautiful daughter,
By a dead beat who wouldn't give a quarter to support her
My money was gettin' low
And my patience was getting shorter
Heard about his new gf and all the shit he brought
So I caught, fought her, heard she had restraining orders
I still grabbed her pony tail and held her under water
So right now I'm sorta locked up for manslaughter
Missing every minute I can't spend with my daughter
Does anyone care (anyone care)
Please tell me
I'm alone and scared (alone and scared)
Please help mee
What should I do (what should I do)
What should I do (what should I do)
What should I do
Please tell me

Loso
I know you hold profession as a lyricist
But you prollly never had depression as severe as this
Your music, it's like a session with a therapist
I asked the lord to send me any blessin if his hearin this
I'm stresssin sumfin serious
Pressin on delirous
A smart man always ask's questions if he's curious
I believe in god, but I don't understand his plan
Why send a Spanish man, way up to afganistan?
Hand this man a rifle
Suit me up in camoflauge
I salute the hand of sarge
He is not a man in charge
I'm fightin this war
Don't know who I'm fightin it for
Might be goin' awol anyday y'all
Does anyone care (anyone care)
Please tell me
I'm alone and scared (alone and scared)

I'm such a fan
I don't have much demands
But I'm really hopin that you will keep in touch with fans
'Cause see,
I know your prolly busy kickin it with one of them pretty girls from on television shaking it
My vision ain't mistaken, I can see you wasn't faking
So I hope, that you can help me with some good decision making
I've been thinkin' a lot, so much I havn't slept in days
My mother and father about to go there separate ways
I'm a teen in the cross of a painful divorce
I love my mum and she thinks I'm an angel of course
I love my dad too
I feel tangled and lost
Who's side should I be on?
Your friend deon
Yeah this song is dedicated to anyone who find theyself in a place where they need
Sum advice
You may not always find that person in the physical form
But there's someone you can trust in
Who listens when everybodies ears are shut
Who sees when everybodies eyes are closed
Who speaks when everybodies voices is silent
Put your faith in god
The man will take you from there

Why wouldn't I talk as greasy as cheese steak meat
In a strawberry Range, pie crust piping on the cheesecake seats
I'm known for hittin' women's soft spots
With Princess cut Canaries the size of lemon cough drops
(Paul Cain)
I'm right behind 'em in the Porsche drop
Linen soft top, sick chain with 20 point rocks
Take your bitch, why wouldn't I?
The whip got chrome shoes, cream leather seats with old wooden sides
(Fabolous)
Uh, yeah, what's really poppin', usually boys know
This ghetto superstar with the Bruce Lee-roy glow
Niggas has to hate the outcome (yeah)
Plus I'm in a throwback from the same year they assassinated Malcolm
(Paul Cain)
Make so much ends, I got to find faster ways to count 'em (yeah)
A minute on the block, how fast I make a thousand? (Cain)
That nigga you love to hate, still hug blocks and bubble weight
Off the love I can't

Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you wanna hate?)
Why wouldn't I what?
(Paul Cain)
Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow is all (ok)
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw (uh huh)
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The Princesses in my hair, are clear and cut, right?
Why wouldn't I talk this slick (why not?)
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get it homes (I mean)
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal (yeah)
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin' that

And academic sample the laws (uh huh)
Hypnotic samples the poor (woo)
The European sample is all (yeah)
Will on the right side do with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep kefs jammed in the four
Amp meter draw, end up in a wheelchair rammed by your dog

After a million scanned on it (yeah)
Why wouldn't the Range look like it got 20-inch ceiling fans on it (woo)
Only reason you in my face ma'am
Is 'cause I got the same mic/mike stat Jordan had on the ""Space Jam""
(Paul Cain)
Why wouldn't I chase chips
Come through Aves, like ""Pluto Nash"" in Coupes that look like spaceships
Ridiculous bracelet and the outrageous
Watch with flawless rocks, invisible placement
(Fabolous)
Uh, I oughta feel like a boss (uh huh)
Why wouldn't I get a 100 an appearance, quarter mil a endorse
I oughta feel some remorse
'Cause I'm killin' 'em out there, and a stick shift sport utility Porsche

Yeah, I know when you see us, it be pissin' you off
Cause you would think we paid a fortune for the shit that we floss
Spend summers in my Sicily loft
Whole crib, interior decoration done by Christian Dior

Challenge me with the bling these niggas know betta
The wings are as big as the logo on those sweaters
Hoes betta, have a fall back attack,
Come through like a funeral all black on black
Couple six deuces, all back to back,
Few flyin spurs all back to back
Need a 04, 05 dunkin 'n' them
When it come to makin' O's we like dunkin with them
Naaaah I ain't talking donuts
I'm talking white ones like the nike low cuts (yup)
You couldn't see me if you stood on your tippy toes
But you could smell this cali cush with the zippy closed
Damn skippy those seats is peanut butter
You never seen us stutter like street fidda didda damn
Yep I'm back stuntin, yep I'm back frontin
Yep I'm somebody who made something outta nothing
Yep I know you see something you wantin

Last time I was seen in a strip club
Rain, I hurricane Katrina the strip club
May I, say I, made a way?
Stay fly till the, day I, fade away
Hey I pray I stay out of a, haters way
Lemme play like A.I., and just get to the point
Lemme hear 'em say ah, when he spit to the joint
You gon hear a spray, rrrraaa, when I get to the joint
And a blind man could see that them niggas with fab is gon'
Come like them dudes came for tony at the Babylon
Rapid fire, do you know a rapper flyer?
The L-O-S-O, I guess no
Yep I'm back stuntin, yep I'm back frontin
Yep I'm somebody who made something outta nothing

Slow windin gangstas throw signs and
I can't help that the chain is so shinin
Got that the shit on my wrist is just co-signin
They don't search us they know we got the flames
But they still let us slide through the door like Cramer
I believe in god, but my true religion
Is stuffin big faces down in these religions
We everywhere you ain't never there
New coupe shoe shine like patent leather airs
Pushin something we ain't got our names on
2 '07's neither one of us is james bond (street fidda didda damn)
We in the V.I.P.'s with the big names
Fendi aviator shades with the big frames
The streets is watchin the hood is lookin'
Brooklyn's back 'n' look at how good I'm lookin'
Yep I'm back stuntin, yep I'm back frontin
Yep I'm somebody who made something outta nothing
Yep I know you see something you wantin
It's just something about me you can't go without me y'all

141,You Be Killin' Em,2010,There Is No Competition 2: The Grieving Music EP (2010),,Fabolous,"You what's up girl, ain't gotta ask it
I dead 'em all now, I buy the caskets
They should arrest you or whoever dressed you
Ain't gon stress you, but ima let you know
Girl you be killin' em
You be killin' em
Girl you be killin' em
You be killin' em
Girl you be killin' em
You be killin' em
Girl you be killin' em
You be killin' em
You ain't gotta worry 'bout her, shorty straight
Been chasing her for 2 days, first 48
A bad bitch cost, she worth every cent
She look like the best money that I ever spent
Just watching my cutiepie get beautified
Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louis Vuitton shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killing her, I call it shoe-icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring 4 figure jacket prices
Her body nice, face dime
Give you that iPhone 4, face time
Shorty in the streets, still handle the home
Enough class for wine, still handle patron
When them other hoes call I hand her the phone
And she hand 'em the tone
Yeah I know that's what they all says
She gotta donkey with a Juan Valdez
Keep it clean cut like bald heads
Been playin' with that green long as Paul Pierce
So you gotta ball harder than them ball players
All she wanna know is there a mall near us
Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her
Shoulda seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walking to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills
And she ain't gotta beg, borrow or steal
Often imitated, never duplicated
They say she a dime, I say she underrated
I just met her so the next solution
Dead my old chick, execution
Had to let you know
All the ladies (to all the ladies)
I'd like to congratulate you
Congratulations
And you just came from the gym clothes
In a fitted cap and some Timbo's
And a pair of flats, well trimmed toes
Camera in the mirror, BBM Pose
Still killin' 'em hoes
You still killin' 'em hoes
You still killin' 'em hoes"
142,Young & Sexy,2004,Real Talk (2004),,Fabolous,"(Feat. Pharrell, Mike Shorey)
(Intro - Fabolous)
Young money on the floor! Trak money on the beat
That's right man, the young and sexy
You're only young as you feel, haha, ya know?
Let's get it in, 25 and younger
(Chorus - Mike Shorey & (Pharrell Williams))
I see you smiling shorty, I see it in your eyes
Security let her through, trust me man she's all right
(She's all right, she's all right, she's all right)
('Cause she's gon ride, she's gon ride, she's gon ride)
(Fabolous - 2x)
To the beat y'all! Till the motherfucking champagne and weed is gone!
(Verse - Fabolous)
I'm so VIP, and Notorious for doing it B.I.G. girl
You ain't gotta see ID, I'm a rich young man
Clean button up wit the rich young pairs
Out of you young ladies, which one can - do it to the beat y'all
Young niggaz get funny, just to get a name
So you know I came with the heat y'all!
You know I got a little money, got a little fame
But you know I came from the streets y'all
If you wanna act funny, I can do the same
And when Pharrell let the beat fall
Let me see you get your hands up high y'all
Just like you're reaching for the sky y'all
For the young sexy and fly y'all
Roll another one, let's get high y'all
(Verse - Fabolous)
From the high heels to low cuts
To the dude in the fast car wit the slow strut girl
They wanna catch J. Jackson
But the money's longer than a stretch Maybach Benz
They say I'm fly enough to do better
But pimp enough to not give a fuck
They say I'm old enough to know better
But young enough to not give a fuck
Tell Stella to move back, if she want Her Groove Back
I get my young man on, then the young man gone
Let's get money again, and even if you ain't
I'll make you feel twenty again, so!
Let me see you get your hands up high y'all
Just like you're reaching for the sky y'all
For the young sexy and fly y'all
Take another shot, let's get high y'all
(Verse - Fabolous)
I'm too young to be sprung
And you can tell I'm too blessed to be stressed
My move is too smooth, on top of that I dress to impress
The walk is so chilled, not to mention the Talk is so Real
We all gotta get old, but before I do I'm a ball outta control
Live young! die rich! woo!"

Make the necks on the ladies go (woo wooop)

Hit Branson get a fifty jug or two
Y'all throwin' on them gritty mugs for who
Like y'all don't know what fifty slugs will do
Hatin' I just bought the bulls
I put y'all in the front page articles
I got 'em lookin' at the billboard charts confused
And I still freestyle to start the Clue's
Reppin I'm that kid about the doe
I done copped coke and started droughts before
Shit Platinum out the door
Now I drop the top down just to shout to hoes
