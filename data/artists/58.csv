0,49ers (Oranges Shirt),2010,I AM JUST a RAPPER (2010),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"(DC Pierson)
Whoa
What'd you get, amnesia?
I bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was Lil' Weezy, huh?
Bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was in a band or somethin'
And my bank balance were around a grand or somethin'
Ask you somethin':
Do you think I'm common like sense it?
That heaven didn't send this
Uniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then
But you know, I know, I'd make a damn good boyfriend
Oil can, oil can
You think I'm the tin man
You took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can
Ain't you heard I got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?
In the mean time don't come crying for the thin man
In the mean time I'll be building my portfolio
All these other dudes eradicated like polio
With any luck you'll see me everywhere like Starbucks
I bet you wanna fuck me when it's time to star buck
(Childish Gambino)
I didn't have green like an Arizona front lawn
Now they try to touch my face like an iPhone
Now I'm all gassed up like Exon
Girls see the money like I fuckin' got checks on
I dunno even know if this girl really likes me
Pickin' up the check like I'm workin' at Nike
Talkin' to this girl and I'm thinkin' that she's into me
Then I find out she's tryin' to break in the industry
That's really lame
I still hit it
But I refuse to be home girl's meal ticket
I'm lookin' for a sick girl to be a part of me
Not a girl who will try to McCartney me
Yes, homie I'm a man of my word
Got this shit in the can like a toilet of turd
And, yes, these gold diggers tryin' to get at my sperm
Well, I'm not a 49ers fan, in case you haven't heard
I know my girl out there somewhere
And if you hear this, you should come here
Unless you don't give head like a weird beer
Elroy, Bam-B, yeah, I'm outta here"
1,All Yall,2014,STN MTN / Kauai (2014),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"Now it's the B to the izzo
You know what it is I'mma stunt on the d-low
Watch me get it in, spin in the seat, black as can be
Rolling it up, giving a fuck, like I'm a slut
Bino that's my baby what he doin' out at the club?
Fuck about your dress code, my dress code is I got a big bank roll
I think so, time to give these niggas something else
Island in the summer best believe that shit ain't common wealth
Smile on her face best believe she wearing nothing else
Watch the sun set that's a feeling that she never felt
We were born free, that's my God given
How a god living? Fantastic, fans spazz when they see ya man passing
I'm in the Aston Martin, unforgivable blackness beg your pardon
All my Jack Johnson nigga, all my shows sell tix like Boston nigga
Put this on at the cook out, let me see you shmoney
Old school on the XM got your Auntie singing ""Hola Hola Ay""
Hit the dream too hard, I'm the new young god
This the new mixtape, but it's still the same game
How you gon be the don, when don half my name?
How you gon be the goat, when we are not the same?
I be feeling all this money but motherfuck the fame
It's the young Bino, I'm in your bae like Oakland
In my bed out of breath I never been this open
If you niggas can't hear me it's the weed I'm smoking
When I opened up the door I had the manager coughing like
""The hotels charging you a maintenance fee""
Gave that nigga 2 stacks and said I'm here all week
Let me roll OG, let me talk my shit
How you hotter than me? You ain't got no hits
You just got a hot feature
Bare sole on the track so my feet hurt
Do some research, know my origin
I'm the new black, fuck oranges
Yeah, that's that nigga that y'all love to hate
Redbone like golden gate
Childish y'all know the name, getting hate from Charlemagnes
Last year things done changed, I was thinking bout killing y'all
I was working all night long, white bitches like King Kong
Getting money my theme song, do what ever I want
Fuck your clique do what I want, fuck your bitch do what I want
Here's some shit you niggas didn't know
Probably wrote your nigga verse
Probably wrote your nigga video
High as fuck on Arsenio
Chosen, now they show my my respect nigga
Frozen, Disney movie round his neck nigga
I told ya, I'm the best right now
From Atlanta where them niggas in your chest like ""blow""
Royalty equal sign black philosophers
Became a top 5 cause nobody else was stopping us
They want me Hopsin but I'm popping and getting confident
God forbid we give him props for the job he did man it's not be some slobbering
I mean, fuck, do you want more?
I'm killing these niggas but still on tour
Fuck is y'all for?
This is for all of y'all
One day everyone's falling off
So right now we should all ball out
Life's too short to not all out
I don't know what I really need
But I'd rather be smoking weed
I don't know what I really need, yeah
But I'd rather be smoking weed"
2,All the Shine,2011,Camp (2011),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"What the fuck do y'all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
And niggas keep asking on whether this dude's for real or not
I'm not trying to come hard, I'm trying to come me
That's why these older songs that I used to make I'd release free
What's the point of rap if you can't be yourself, huh?
That's why I come first like my cell phone
I'm a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it's dumb, that's the fucking reason I'm doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
'Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend's baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
(See, that's not even right)
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she's sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That's not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
'Cause I ain't Mumford, I ain't tryin' to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain't the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion!
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
""Baby, I'm okay."" She said, ""Why you gotta act so strange?""
I said, ""Baby, I'm okay."" She said, ""Why you gotta act so strange?""
I said, ""Baby, I'm okay."" She said, ""Why you gotta act so strange?""
I said, ""Baby, I'm okay."" She said, ""Why you gotta act so strange?""
Am I serious? I don't even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain't trying, I'm doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R's a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short-shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, ""I'd get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man""
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain't Curren$y, but if there ain't money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loves to text me Psalm verses
She don't look at me like I'm the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
And I don't want them missing a son like Bone's last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I'm grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with No I.D. and no I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find
We need to find
We need to find
""Baby, I'm okay."" She said, ""Why you gotta act so strange?""
I said, ""Baby, I'm okay."" She said, ""Why you gotta act so strange?"""
3,Almost There,2009,Poindexter (2009),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"Girl, I messed up real bad
I'm looking back on the days that we both had
I go to bed and I dream so hard
Of little mixed kids running in the front yard
I need you close, I need your kiss
I never ever, ever, ever knew a love like this
I, miss you more than puffy missed b.i.g
I didn't think that you would leave a hole this big
In my life, you need to be my wife
I made this song, I hold my pillow tight
And wishin' it was you, what can a nigga do
Fuck this success, fuck these interviews
Fuck these phone calls, girl you are worth it
When I was happy, you were happy, you are perfect
When I was blue, you were blue, you're my smurfette
I put my best chips on the worst bet
Girl, I need you like I need air
And fuck those other honeys, I will be there
I never ever, ever thought that I would be scared
Of living in a world when you're not there
My biggest fear is that you won't give a fuck
When you play this song on your macbook
""Is that cg, yo, he is old news
I'm way too busy with my new dude.""
The best time I ever had
Is kissing in my shitty ass kia van
I wish that it was me instead
Feeling all your pain
I know that it is different now
It will never be the same but
I swear to god, our love special
You can be my number 2 like one pencil
Or you can be my number one, I will let you
In on my life, I've changed so much since you
Left, that hotel room
And if you're with another guy, go tell dude
That he can never keep us apart, he needs a better door
He'll always be the guy that you settle for
I'll always be the guy you're s'posed to be with
Where the fuck is cupid when you need him
I'm so sam cooke, I need tea for two
I play sam cooke and I think of you
Baby girl we need to be together
This song ain't for my album
This song is for the better
And even though we living in a city full of strangers
They can see I'm different
They can see my anger
They can see my pain
They can see the way I talk about you
They see the way I living and I won't live long without you
I drink every night, I smoke more too
I guess it's safe to say death or you
I need you more now than I ever did
I'm still the same guy you fell in love with
I need a second chance like I need a prayer
Sometimes I think god just doesn't care
I hope he has a plan for both you and i
So we can be together at a different time
Remember when I come home late
And you'd be crying over some food on a cold plate
I'll never do that shit to you again
You're the most beautiful girl I ever known and my best friend
Baby girl we need to make up
And when I dream of you, I don't want to wake up
And when I don't dream, I don't want to wake up
I'd rather die now than not have your touch
'Cause I miss you so much"
4,AssShots Remix,2014,STN MTN / Kauai (2014),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"(Intro: DJ Drama (Childish Gambino))
Is it too much to ask for lyrics?
(All right, all right)
(Royalty has never done a track together)
I mean it's 2014 man, c'mon really
(Well I thought we would get everybody on the same track)
You niggas could learn a lot by now
(I'll go first)
Stone Mountain
(Verse 1: Childish Gambino)
Give a fuck about these haters man
I'm the flyest that there's ever been
I'm always reppin' Stone Mountain
You know my show is sold out
You know my smoke is so loud
It's still about his business
Stay up out my business
Flow so vicious
When niggas talkin' shit, shut they mouth, catch what this is
I walk up in the party, we took all the bitches
They love how I move, we might need a minute
God damn, Summer looking like son of Sam, I'm killin' niggas
Hang with models and a couple strippers
She love my music so I nutted in her
Damn I'm decent, Liam Neeson
I'm takin' over, you plain sober
Gassed up and you finished last
I'm crying nigga, that's tear gas
Woooh, now I'm flexing
Was that fire? Bitch you guessed it (Oh shit!)
(Hook: Steve G Lover)
I bet you I can make that ass hot
C'mon bae, drop it like a ass shot
Say my sixteen will make that ass hot
Song done, drop it like a ass shot
Boy stuntin' got they ass hot
Go on nigga, drop 'em like a ass shot
Jump on this beat and get they ass hot
Go on girl, drop it like a ass shot
(Verse 2: Steve)
I am, the prince, two cups, always
Our team, got money, stunt hard, so don't hate
Fall off, no way, we run it, it's too late
We smoke sour, call that flowers
I just blew, a bouquet
My girl, so sweet, like Crème brûlée
But still, she that hood, like red Kool-Aid
We on top, toupée, I got hits, like touché
I just did Rome in one day
I just flew out to Croat-ia
I'm independent man and still doin' major
Young King so flashy got me lookin' like lazers
Atlanta housewife I can make ya like Phaedra
So let's play my, I'mma play ya
Get bands, then head to la playa
My niggas is bias
My brothers the owner, fuck with 'em get higher
G-lover spit fire, that flame is saliva
We're riders that got Nick Cannon's now
Make 'em drop you like Mariah, wassup
(Verse 3: Swank)
Start her off with gin and tonic, mine's a double
Out in Vegas fool, you know I'm bettin' double
Double your car note, double your mama rent
Ain't shit but house money, I ain't spent a cent
Mo' money mo' problems, yeah that's official
I just throw cash at it, that's my issue, it's hard
So I feed my boo boo hard that moo moo bags
If she need mo', then girl I miss you, bye
But ain't no lookin' back
'Cause I know it's a salt pile (you salty?)
I'm goin' Chevy with metallic fuckin' gun style
No door handle, she high tryna figure how
While my auto mobile looks like Girls Gone Wild
That's top off, nigga drop offs
Slidin' dirty with yo' dame
OG sativa baby, watch ahead for that air plane
Fuck with my money, and I'm at your house like the mail came
You meet the Swank lion, beast mode, untamed
(Verse 4: Fam)
Big homie have you seen her
She got the Dobrev, all white nina
Packed like Serena, maybe Trina
Shit I don't know, they both got ass
So of course he came to give you all these courses
And you can't ignore 'em, cause these hoes adore 'em
Words hot, don't slur 'em
I just speak up, so please ho, keep up
Please ho, keep up
Ok, ok, ok, she ain't getting money, no way
I met her on a Monday, but I fucked her back to Sunday
I told her she my Brandy, I'm her one and only Wanya
Till she drove off the driveway in her '97 Hyundai, bitch"
5,Assassins,2008,Sick Boi (2008),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"Mapquest where the place is
Gats in they faces
Then we fold them up and put them back in they cases
Assassins replace expressions on faces
And hard eyes on gangsters with hot gaping spaces
Hands full of aces, pockets on swole
Glassy-eyed aiming from my own grassy knoll
Leave JFK's head just a big smoky hole
To console Jackie O she could smoke my pole
It's called Camelot 'cause she came a lot
And a lot of you rappers sound the same a lot
And the game is still out there if you play or not
And I'm the King of Queens, Kevin James is not
I quit my temp job 'cause I can't let a day go
Tomorrow's moguls are delivering your bagels
I hope your trophy wife been practicing her kegels
'Cause when we take the game we won't leave you any Legos
There go the kid with his dirty white sneakers on
Dreaming on a way to get his penthouse on Bleecker on
Give your girl head, call you with the speaker on
Horse head in your bed, now you know who you sleeping on
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
This booth is a crime scene
Chalk off the mic, the kill screen is my screen
No need to terrify or pop shots at witnesses
They only testified they know what hot shit this is
(Hook (x2): Childish Gambino)
True assassins
Hold your glass up
Them's the type of niggas that'll cut yo ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses
Chains or purses
Them the type of niggas that'll make you stop
(Verse 2: Nick Packard)
Classic assassin
Straight from Central Castin'
I bust through your abode with both barrels blastin'
I crush up your skull like a truck that you crashed in
I'm never gonna die like I'm Tuck Everlasting
Never thought that I'd carry an AK
All I ever wanted to be is Farley, Ferrell, or Fey
And maybe some day that dream will come true
But for now I got my gun and I'm aiming at you (Hey!)
In your house on your couch while you're readin'
I got no flow, it's more like breakthrough bleedin'
But I'm into cartoons and I'm really not sane
All I leave of your body is a Pinky and the Brain (Uh!)
I'm more Manson than a small-time crook
When it comes to taking lives I steal like Dane Cook
Bitch, take a look, you know it's in a book
Even LeVar Burton's Roots get shook
(Verse 3: Childish Gambino)
Ah, ah, you can call me assassin, I kill Versace
I walk too much, gotta Gucci watch me
The illest of the killers you can tell by my fashion
Light hoodie to bright sneaks it's all matchin'
I kill rappers, I don't need no stealin'
If I do lose a battle I'mma kill 'em for real
I'm just kidding, or am I?
Things get real in the City of L.I
That's right, I live in Queens
The borough of the lost
I hate the fuckin' yuppies but I love how much it costs
Call me in the winter and the spring to play tennis
And they give me strange looks 'cause I floss like a dentist
I'mma finish this sentence then get me a rope
So I got a little dough and I'm fresh like Scope
A nigga so dope, I got the new Pumas
That never take a bath so I call 'em homeschoolers
Numbers like rulers, I'm tired of it all
I sleep in the club and I yawn when I ball
I'm off the hook like phone calls
Where's kidrobot?
I need a new hoodie hot pink like doughnuts
The kids is Go-Gurts when they see my Gobstoppers
I'm not Mekhi Phifer, but I got Clockers
Transform a watch when I don't got diamonds
Boy, did you hear what I said like Simon?
I kill boutiques
Just snatch the new sneak
I'mma do it every week
I'm a serial killer
Beats like Dilla
Hun like 'tilla
It's the Sick Boi thrilla (Yeah, mon!)

6,Baby Boy,2016,"""Awaken, My Love!"" (2016)",Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"Little hands, little feet
Tiny heart, tiny beat
Oh, thinkin' 'bout the time we spent falling in love together
I don't wanna leave you, I don't wanna deceive you
But oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies
Oh my, please don't take him away, mama
Don't take him away, oh
'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close
All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one
And they know your son
Oh, please don't take him away
You said you won't but you will, yes you will
'Cause I've had my time, oh!
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close
(Don't take my baby boy)
There was a time before you
And there will be a time after you
(Don't take my pride and joy)
Though these bodies are not our own
(I hope I stay close)
Walk tall, little one, walk tall
(Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy)
Let me hold you, let me hold you

Can I hold you?"

I'll hold you closer
I'll hold you closer
Just like I'm supposed to
Know I got what you need (x4)
I'm a weird dude, but you like me
Give other girls shocks like Nikes
I know I'm always on the road you can type me
And if you don't do that you can Skype me
I'm a big kid, and you know that
But it don't make me happy so we blow that
Can I make time? I don't really know
'Cause I see you're pissed off when I go to shows
I never really had a girl like this
But I ain't never had a girl who could keep interest
The things that I do, the things that I wanna be
I know I'm hardheaded, can't see things in front of me
I'm gonna be the best, you can believe that
So try an understand when I have to leave that
When I'm done, I'ma give you the call
Don't ya know sugar, you my sugar babydoll
I love you both, can't you tell?
I love her lights, I love the smell
But I think you kinda know I got a girl on the side
She pay for my house and she pay for my ride
She give me nice things and she make me feel good
She give me a little cash and I spend on you
She my sugar mama only with her for the money
But you know it's untrue 'cause I talk about her funny
Saturday night's, I'm supposed to be with you
But instead I'm in bed with the stage and the crew
She laughs at my jokes, she tells me I'm cute
She tells me if we together we make a little loot
But I know I couldn't have her if I didn't have you
And I know sometimes I don't make curfew
Ya know I'd never, ever, ever try to hurt you
I'm a just try to do what I gotta do"

Mr. Talk-about-his-dick-again
Nerdy ass black kid
Whatever man, I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token
Who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the n-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred
Use it till it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine
I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with 2 fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83
Half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem
I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids
Not Chuck Inglish, but people who think
That hatin' on me makes them distinguished
Like, ""What is this nigga doin' rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot man he think that we feel that""
Or
""I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed
To say what all his raps are about""
You better shut your mouth
Before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now?
Or Kid Cudi's? Nigga
Runnin' this thang
Money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name in the woods got these niggas usin' MapQuest
Man, fuck a backpacker
Nigga's with OCD, N-W-O
All white like my clothes, CW shows
Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly
No cosine, trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
""Man, fuck you nigga... fuck you nigga!""
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the titans
Baby, your tits is titular
Listenin' to some KISS FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
Super Bass, super face inside a garage
It's not a massage
Spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame
These kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that paint back
Comin' on that mace took
I'm comin' on that real shit
I'm comin' on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick, uh
Runnin' this thang
Money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name in the woods got these niggas usin' MapQuest

Sick boy make moves like a chess piece
And that move real quick like Nestle
Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi
I was never worried bout my wallet bein' empty
'Cause when it was empty, I was still happy
Walkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin'
High school bullies like what the fuck happened
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain
And this supposed to be relaxin', rappin' is my hobby
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry
Watchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith went off without a hitch man
C-H-I-L-D it's the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian
I've always been this good, you just weren't listening
I'mma try to make my street cred stack up
I mean I'm rapping over Grizzy Bear, what the fuck
Gather swagger up, before I take it all
You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball
I started rapping 'cause I fucking need some Adderall
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods
I make you iPod hotter than a lighter would
Picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite
Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe
Kid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy
Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy
You better recognize, 'cause I'm no better now
'Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital
And that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow
That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!
I'm wearing tight jeans, and nobody's laughing
More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins
Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman
I did exactly what you niggas said would never happen.
I'm doing me so big I can hardly walk
These rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark
This kinda music make your balls drop, Dick Clark
Yes I'm grown and sexy, and I'm worth the wait
Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date
Put these words on your head and let them percolate
We need to separate church and state.
I used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn
And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor

Really everything, like the headphones
Yeah, yeah, a little bit louder
No punch, you know that mean that we workin' hard
(Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle)
Look, young rich nigga shit, pops was an immigrant
Lifestyle illegit, but know I own businesses
Started out the trunk, ended up at the dealership
All gold Rollie, black face no blemishes
Legend in my city 'cause I grind so vigorous
If I show my face west of Texas, that's a big event
Gotta pay me twenty cents just to hear me vent
I'm really out here on some shit, you should take a flick
Ballin' on my own ten toes, so the difference is
I call shots never ask for permission, man
I got a lot of big plans in my vision and
I ain't failed yet, 'bout a dollar hell yes
I'm a problem filled test, it's only getting worse
I swear I'm getting money, I just hope you gettin' yours
I'm killin' niggas solo so you know I'm gettin' more
Now that young Gambino on the chorus, go
(Hook: Childish Gambino)
This is for that real shit, this is for that East side
This is for my bad girls, this is for them good guys
This is for my grandma, this is for that West side
This is for them niggas talkin' shit on a website
Damn I feel good, you ain't feelin' nothin'
This is for my niggas who be livin' dime a dozen
Bino got that good shit, Nipsey got them aces
On some young rich shit, Kennedys with black faces

Look, yo I got this
Yo, turn, turn it up a little
Ay, here we go, okay
(Verse 2: Childish Gambino)
League of my own, swag Geena Davis
Only rapper make 100k on your playlist
Niggas talk on twitter, but in life they don't say shit
My Rollie so racist, all black faces
We the new facet, kill 'em like Jason
Grind in my sleep man a nigga need braces
Wonder what you feelin' like, used to be the nervous type
They ain't mention Bino? Man that shit must be on purpose, right?
Hostile, nigga my style
Kind of flow to paint a picture, Norman Rockwell
I don't eat pasta, everything is low-carb
I don't fly coach now, say I fly Goyard
Leave a face covered in that coast guard
Metaphor Mozart, all we do is tell 'em the truth
M Fox to my people on some family ties
Magazines got black faces when somebody dies
I mean look at Donna Summers, she was tryin' to survive
People wrestle over petty cash
When we should be really cryin' over that one percent
Like we tipped a milk glass
Fuck y'all, I'mma let my grandkids ball
Look to the future, these dudes so last week
See me stuntin' so Conde Nasty
Me and Nipsey on some grown shit, no rent
Own shit, so Jim Crow shit, black faces

Told me I should just quit: ""First of all, you talk white.
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet""
Rap's stepfather, yeah you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now nigga that's a mixtape!
Shout out to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shout out to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' ""Oww!""
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' ""What the fuck is up?"" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it - Casey Anthony

They wanted something different, nigga problem solved
Drunk off the high life, death is when I'll sleep it off,
Lifes a hangover and this rapping shits my tylenol
I could call any girl in my phone right now,
Have a pillow and a mouth watch her bite down,
She like me 'cause I'm flier than a kite now,
Its funny how I get these write ups on what I write down
Chick on my left arm, she could write The King And I,
I'd rather die the truth, these niggas live a lie
Dressed like a gentleman, my mouth is never civilized,
See me as a hero, use my little brother's eyes.
Always do me like I love self portraits,
Now these fake niggas say hay like horse shit,
People treat me different but I'm still the same person,
I don't know what it means, I just know that its worth it,
I know I'm not perfect, but I am original
Wallet stay healthy, vitamins, minerals,
Gotta feed the bitch right, stuff her full of spinach,
Facebook messages asking how I did,
No time to respond, time is money, lifes a debit card,
Spend it on the right shit, these bitches want you overdrawn,
Drake with dyslexia, I have gone so far
My life is a green light, I always try to go hard.
I am just Different
I am so different, the games on lid eye (?),
Listen to my mixtape, change your all shit up,
Salad backstage, I just wanna eat alone,
Crowd at my shows more mixed than Rashida Jones,
Haters say I'm changing, but I haven't changed at all
Indie kids saying that I ruined all their favorite songs,
Hood niggas sayin' that I'm whiter than that colgate,
Hatin' on my progress, I'm a long ways from Bro Rape,
Black Clark Kent, all I needs a louis lane,
But let her spend the night once and watch her go insane,
Voice mail, E-mail, sending text message,
We are not engaged just because I made breakfast,
Believe me you don't want this, I am all about business,
Life is a bitch, I must be dating her sisters,
Got to be different, take chances like pictures,
Emerge victorious, stunt on y'all bitches,
I'm not at the top, but y'all niggas know I'm comin' fast,
Rap will change after me, all of this will come to pass,
Rappers start to use real instruments and shit,
Niggas start to copy me, dumb it down and make it rich,
I am not a novelty, just the first to do it different,
I have always been this good, you were just laughing too hard to listen,
Got my career overnighted, maybe you should order one,

Echo motherfucker, you are just another dolphin
Hello motherfucker, like I walked in on incest
Do it motherfucker, talking does not impress
Us, man, us
It's all about us
Like them self absorbed teen girls talking on the bus
We trust you to pay when we ask you to pay
Till then, Chili Peppers, we give it away
I don't fuck the fans, I am not the industry
Man, I hate it when the man comes between you and me
I don't masturbate, I give a handjob to a star and
Picture you bumping out this anthem in your car
Still showing up for our dorks, geeks, losers
Rode out from New York on six beach cruisers
And if we could we'd ride with every kid right on the handlebars
We are just some rappers like some fat kid ate the candy bars

Flier than a Cardinal, check my fuckin' latitude

Switched over from street niggas to hipsters
I am so different, Donald Glover in the bitch
I don't need to use my rapper name, that's just Childish

Maybe then I will be white enough to hang out with them kids
They have to call you names when they don't know what you are

APC kicks, looking like a British boy
More money means more problems, I have been annoyed
Dude mad 'bout the girl that I came with
I'm fly, she fly, you are just penguin
I am just a rapper so I don't speak English
I just go hard like the traffic light changes
Sick boy, bitch, we the clique like seat belts

Then to New York, I'm an army brat
And I learn new things all across the map
In Cali I was small taught need to be strong
And Atlanta had the hawk so I learned how to ball
New York had Starks on the New York Knicks
So when they came around I had my first round pick
And now I'm so sick that they call me Ebola
Sick girls all on my pole like totem
Life is a gamble, your boy done told 'em
Play your cards right like it's Texas hold 'em
Bounce dem shoulders, go ahead Bankhead
I can do it better even though I'm stone mountain
Georgia's on my mind, but I live in New York
So I got Southern Drawl and I limp when I walk
They used to say a nigga lame when I started to rap
No them fake fuck niggas askin' me for a track
Pokin' me on facebook tryin' to be my friend
Nigga you get your face took you ask me one more 'gain
I'm a genius, why they call the shit G-mail man
This is my space nigga, you can't make top ten
Explain"

Nigga, I come hard like I'm filled with semen
These rappers bore me
Gun talk with black clothes
Y'all let me know when y'all let 1998 go
Y'all niggas scared to grow
I'm never scared to go
Anywhere that's new, I go outside, y'all niggas stay at home
But that's all right dude
I'm a special guy
Y'all been wanting to rap since you were ankle high
And I've been wanting to rap since like what, 05?
Do the math man, how are you one of the best alive?

King of fly rappers, there ain't none iller
I'm into fly sneakers, colors like Gullies
So if you don't know me by now: ""You's a dummy""
It's the Sick Boi anthem, girls take your coats off
Get the champagne, pop the cork like Sosa
Make some mimosas, get like me
Spanish girls holla say, ""Aye papi""
Ooh la la, on the French Riviera
These other boys sandals, straight club benders
We some go-getters, you should know better
Your girl think 'bout me while she drivin' a Jetta
Used to blast Kelly Clarkson, now she a sick girl
Hot pink shirt and them lime green sneakers
Take a quick picture, put me on blast
Call the fireman, he need to come fast
I'm on fire
They call me Sick Boi 'cause they know I'm so sick
Purple on my starter cap, yellow on my kicks
Haters talkin' shit, they think they so slick
And if you don't like my style: ""Eat a dick""
I'm a younger Denzel, say it ain't so
I'm all puffed up like I'm made of afros
But my neck ain't froze, where's the boy's jewelery?
Don't need it nigga, clothes bright, shine beautifully
Used to sport Airs then I had to get Grind
Now I look great, now I'm top of the line
Used to go hungry when I'd buy them new shoes
Now I'm like ""Mm... food"" like MF Doom
Busy makin' moves like my name was Tetris
Money in the bank, you can check my mattress
Bright like Mantis and I ain't selfish
I got the game shook like a young black Elvis

Fire like I'm third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high

Skateboardin' down at Washington Square
Lookin' for quarters
Maybe afford a falafel for dinner, ugh

Scholarship apology
Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'
Girls like, ""we love you, we go to LSU
You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you""
This rap stuff is magic
I used to get called ""Oreo"" and ""Faggot""
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
Oh you got a mixtape? That's fantastic
But everybody thought it was jokes though
They half right, the joke is
I got flow so don't act like
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like, it can't be
I know Donald Glover, he weak man, he can't be
I'm still knocked down, but I up the ante
Me and hip-hop, that black Sid and Nancy
It's hard to make HOV the footsteps you followin'
Especially when your niggas look like Carlton
The pretty girls usin' skin so soft
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off
Man you act too soft
Fuck you! I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows, 'cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
Yeah so, whatcha gonna do man?
You won't speak to the hood, man
If I was given one chance I think I could, man
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't 'cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I wanna write
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And yousa fake fuck like a fleshlight
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z?
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', ""You could tear this up""
I don't really like shades, big rims, or jewelry
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be

Go [x4]
Wait a minute! [echoes]
Starter cap bro, gone with the hologram
I be the rich folk's hoe like a Ottoman
I got weed in my hand like a homey can
A throwback like a bitch throw Radaman
I'm fire! All I need is the breaks though
I make noise in the streets like a brake toe
But that's high, so I'm gettin' my fade low
I make movies with my lover like J-Lo
I'm livin' so shiny, ya boy on top
A life on trap, a nigga can't stop
I'm Weird like Al, I'm Strange like Love
I wear hot pink cause it fit like glove
I'm easy on the eyes; I'm hard on a hater
My hoodie light saber, like Darth Vader
I'm always with a chick cause a nigga so sick
Need an ""Entourage"" quick so you can hug it out bitch
(Chorus: repeat with ad libs)
I'm so fresh! [oh yeah, oh oh]
I'm so fresh like a ""Sick Boi"" oughta be
I'm not tryin' that shit, just a part of me
I'm easy, like a Sunday morning
I go to rap battles and I end up yawning
I'm fresh like TexMex in Arizona
Got my gold on forever like my name Ramona
I can't be a loser, the shit don't suit me
A nigga Joe Cool and you niggaz just Snoopy!
You can go sue me, try to do outdo me
I look so fresh that I killed George Clooney
I guess you can call me ""The Perfect Storm""
I'm the reason why your new baby brother was born
A nigga so tore call me Natalie
'Cause I love makin' music but they mad at me
I make money, blow shows like a syndicate
Out to be who I gotta be, that's the end of it!"

Seein all this pussy, Ima fuck it all
Fly around the world, eatin good, drinkin' alcohol,
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all.
Tell 'em what it is, I'm takin' great strides,
Hood niggas, hipsters, I ain't trying to take sides,
Ex-Girlfriend on my mind, she really fucked up,
Doing shots of whiskey till my friends are saying that's enough,
I really really miss her, sometimes I wanna fuck it all,
Mix some warm Guinness with 20 tablets of tylenol,
Call 'em while I'm drifting off, tell her that I love her so,
Parents crying harder 'cause I didn't even leave a note,
Saying that I'm selfish and I'm sorry that I left,
But it hurts so much to wake up and I left you guys a check,
'Cause I ain't fucking happy, you don't know shit about me,
I think it started when she said she happier without me,
I really can't blame her 'cause I'm happier without me,
I don't see what girls are seeing when they say their all about me,
I'm scared they wanna trap me, these all hoes are all liars,
I double bag my shit and never cum while I'm inside her,
I used to be a sweet dude, now I'm so angry,
Look at what these girls and these fake niggas made me,
Cry when I'm writing, I don't really know why,
I think its 'cause I can't really see myself an old guy,
And that scares me, I wanna be around a while,
But I feel my purpose goes beyond having raised a child,
Bright lights, they tend to burn out fast,
So I shine bright, But I'm scared that it won't last.
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all,
Seein all this pussy, Ima fuck it all

You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all.
I'm just about the pot (?), the industry just noticed it,
People watching me, I feel like amber rose's tits,
Friends of mine are over it, people say I changed,
And I tell them that I'm glad, 'cause I don't wanna stay the same,
'Cause I used to be poor, I used to be unconfident,
I used to hate these haters, now its just the opposite,
Not only have I changed, I'm becoming something better,
And revenge is for the weak, so I have settled my vendettas,
With all of the kids who made my early life a living hell,
And I hope you're doing well and feeling better 'bout yourself,
Don't know if you can tell, but change is usually for the better,
I used to like these bitches but couldn't afford to get em,
But now I'll take your girl, yeah player pay homage,
That's why I fuck these bad mamas, Kate Gosselin,
I'm trying to tell the world I'm nothing to be trifled with,
Donald Glover staying hotter than some rifle spit,
They only wanna fuck with you after you made your way,
But when you started out you couldn't pay 'em to stay,
But now I got 'em lined up in the lobby door,
It makes me wonder what this rapping shits a hobby for,
Oh that's right, because I'm gifted in another field, and another field, and another field,
They say my public persona don't have enough appeal,
I take a lesson from Kanye and give 'em something real,
I'm getting all this attention I wanna do it right,
That's why I'm performing for you like every single night,
To all my fans who's saying Donald Glover about to blow,
Just give me six months so you can say I told you so.
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all,
Seein all this pussy, Ima fuck it all
Fly around the world, eatin good, drinkin' alcohol,
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all.

Hey go DJ! (That's my DJ!)
Hey go DJ! (That's my DJ!)
Hey go DJ! (Uh, yeah, uh)
Stuntin' 101, I'm doing shit that y'all never done
Talking from TVs and movies, these the choppers to Uzis
Nothing can bruise me, nigga this is more than a movement
My squad is forever, we ain't getting annulments
New song on your speakers got me getting enormous
Played a performance, niggas getting paid on performance
A lot of y'all hate cause my women is gorgeous
I mean they a work of art, something out of a portrait
I mean I'm a work of art, all my verses is poetry
Niggas is different, you chicken, we ain't fucking with poultry
Bunch of crab ass bloggers got me allergic to shellfish
If I fell off in a day, man, these niggas be helpless
I be bringing on a plane till you lames get mailed it
It's ROYALTY and, nigga, I'm the king like Elvis
I don't talk about it, let them niggas conversate
What's the song about it? Give a D and smoke a J
We don't play, I'm so on a bench, money is the stench
Let me vent, I'mma smoke 'em out, circles from her mouth
What's my favorite sound? ""Oh my God I'm cumming""
Second favorite sound? ""Oh that sound like money""
Oh that sound like freedom
Oh that sound gon' need a feature but he didn't need him
I'm coming back like Jesus, color Reeces Pieces
That's the money down here, we gon' need a visa
Bread like he Anita
That's my DJ, thank you DJ Drama
Came in this bitch like my baby mama
I believe in karma so I run the summer
All I got is checks, check out all these commas
Check out how I'm eating, it is very cool
James White a nigga, man I'm such a fool
I'm doing me so cold, this nigga spitting so cold
This girl 20 years old, she know she 'bout to get choose
That rabbit hole, I'm talking shit, but I'm rapping though
And that IRS and I'm taxing hoes and I saw the check
And said ""add some o's, add some o's!""
Why my clique so animal? Why my clique so Set It Off?
When I'm Queen Latifah you know I'm eatin', I fucked it up
Niggas think we ain't tough enough, niggas think we was born rich
Niggas thinking a lot of shit, niggas don't know a wars coming
Niggas don't know I saw something, killing trees, Paul Bunyon
Bunyon foot, foot clan, klans man... Alamo
Stream of conscious, I don't know
Flow was done a long time ago, and I feel for niggas who save a ho
I ain't got time and I'm throwing up like gang signs
But that was not the case
You niggas wish your lifestyle was nice as my place
I'm eating off these white kids, I don't need their plate
We burning down that blue dream, she sitting on my face
I'd leave it on her backside, but that'd be a waste
That be a waste, that be a waste

Yes, I run this shit, like it's hard to walk
And you think that I'm dope, like a mound of chalk
I'm recession proof. I work to relax, hoe
Weird voice catch beef like a lasso
New fresh prince, you can chill in my castle
Spit real shit, so I must be an asshole, right?
Nah, that's why I'm makin' out in your car
These blogs are a dude's A&R
Got a big tip for these girls at the bar
But I don't mean money
Ever since the money, they just treat me funny
Girls look good, she can take green from me
Ain't trickin' if you got it, know what I mean, buddy?
You've got your yellow sun dress on
I'm tryna write you the best song
With your Wayfarer shades, you drive me insane

Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Oh, fallin' down, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
I turn 'em like Tina, I don't tote ninas
But a nigga walked up and get served like subpoenas
And I ain't broke neitha, I got a in-between
So when I say about a million what I mean is bitch fiend
I gotta keep grinding, my name Tony Hawk
'Cause I grind with my boys sometimes at the park
A heavy-ass kid, easy on the cake
Until I got to New York and I started losin' weight
And when I say ""weight,"" I do mean ""weight""
Now I'm thin like the line between love and hate
'Cause I used to go skate
Nigga I'm paid, this kid don't play like a high-top fade
I don't get laid, I'm back at the studio
The closest girls get is watchin' old Derrick videos
Girls don't get it, say I work too much
Pass boo the cell phone and say, ""Girl, be in touch""
But we won't be in touch, I know that for sure
You ain't in love with me, you like my décor
Christian Dior, pastel and Jack
If it's in hot pink then it's on my back
I'm young and I'm black and the world is my oyster
Watchin' Top Chef on my European sofa
These niggas so fake like an old toupee
So clear call this shit Blu-Ray
Ooh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Oh, ah, oh yeah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Take me to a hospital, call me Ebola
And a nigga flow sweet, so I spit Coca-Cola
And my boys sold boulders, but I gotta do it my way
We grindin' the same, but we usin' different pathways
Gotta make ends meet, a means to an end
And I hate seein' niggas usin' ""grind,"" for pretend
This ain't pretend, and I ain't pretendin'
We eatin' out late like I hang with the gremlins
Call David Geffen, we about to switch places
The game is a hold, got a pocket full of aces
Boy, I'm a phenom, I can't be stopped
Had my RA pager on my first day at 30 Rock
Headed for big things like I'm runnin' Salma Hayek
Four Seasons plus no more work at the Hyatt
I'm fly and I'm high like a pilot
But you can't see me like an eyelid, vibin', uh
Ooh
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Ah, ah
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind
Got to get on my grind

I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

Skinny tie and a cuff tight
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that the songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you
The girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
The text say that ""It's not fair""
That's code for ""He's not here""
And I'mma flirt with this new girl
And I'mma call if it don't work
So we fuck till we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we was losing
I'm ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
'Cause I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat

It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well, two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she gonna play games
With the super smash brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smokin' light
I wanted you to know

Can't speak, I can't speak
I wanted you to know

Can't speak, I can't speak
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his posts on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I'm the best when I'm a-ffection-ate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related, racist
I give you money, then you burn it, like you Madoff
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, ""What the fuck you hiding?""
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something in between that?
I wish we never fucked and I mean that
But not really
You say the nastiest shit in bed and it's fuckin' awesome"

Keep my swagger poloroid you can watch it develop
Ain't it funny in a year I went from different to special
Yeah I got it together, yeah I took those chances
Labels on me like I might cause cancer

APC store walkin' out with eight bags

You ever spend three grand on designer vision,
When you should've spent it on your little sis' tuition?
She played my album when nobody else out there would listen
I'm comin' harder than these girls that you would swear were pissin'
Davinci-esque, I'm the real deal
The only thing I don't know is how afraid feel
I'm living everything these other niggas lyin' bout
Bitches don't believe me, to prove it to 'em I fly 'em out
She say that I'm her everything, I'm better than those other guys

Listen to the next track I be on That other shit
Yes I sound weird, nigga, take it as a compliment
Guess who's in the house and representing like a congressman
Anything I put my mind to I accomplish it
From writing scripts with Tina Fey to laying down the hardest shit
Who else is doing what I'm doing? No one
And I mean girls too, intended no pun
I'm on the road son, busy like I'm Bone Thug
Comment left anonymous cause ain't nobody want none
She laying in my bed she gotta be bi-curious
Barf on the track, the amazing and rap-furious
Damn bloggers argue whether or not I'm serious
It's Nas' Illmatic not Eddie Murphy's Delirious
Got the limelight, you stupid you think I'm sharing this
Showing up late, promoters wondering where he is
Got some nightmares, my family gotta be scariest (?)

I'll hold you down, oh
Ooh, you want it, yeah
When the fuck these niggas
Tryin' to hold me down
You such a fuckin' lame
That's what they used to yell back in 7th grade
My mama said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down
Hit the office stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found
Not bad for a family of foster child
Lookin' fly, man I'm flossin' now.
But them niggas saw through me
Are you serious? What is this?
Took the jacket off third period
Ellipses
Listening to ""Sky is the Limit"" on my Walkman
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it
Man, than I can
Dope boy swag, I always wanted that
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
But no love for the son of a commuter
Who was a radiohead
And okay at the computers at the post office
It's funny how you smoke niggas
Then you start coffins
All my people need throat lozenge
My fear is dead
Ambition drove the hearse
When niggas get to feeling I ain't black enough to go to church
Culture shock in barber shops 'cause I ain't hood enough
We all look the same to the cops
Ain't that good enough?
The black experience is black and serious
'Cause being black my experience is no one hearing us
White kids get to wear whatever hat they want
When it comes to black kids one size fits all
We the baddest nigga
We the baddest nigga
Yeah, we the baddest nigga
We the baddest nigga, come on
(x 2)
The reason that they say I'm nothing
But they seen it hurts
The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
They only see you how they wanna see you
Till you make 'em see you in some other way
I'm trippin' off the other day
'Cause God knows what these white kids say and do
You're not NOT racist 'cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
Subtle racism, it's hard to pin it
'Cause you'd only understand if you were me for just a minute
This one kid said something that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad
Mostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
If you're a father you should stick around if you could
'Cause even if you're bad at it you'll get Tiger Woods
Or M.J.
We warriors, we all need senseis
Change everything that we done so far
I don't mean make 'em BET, T-E-R
I mean just the way we see each other
I won't stop until they say James Franco
Is the white Donald Glover
Yeah, these niggas want a cookie
But instead I gave 'em Loch Ness
Sick boy for life, my swag is in the hospice
Aimin' for the throne
Jay and Ye said to watch that
They ask me what I'm doing
And I say I'm stealin' rock back

Nigga, I'm the capper
Rapper slash not actor
'Cause I could never act the part of being fakey
You should really thank me
Who else would do this shit?
All that fucking wishing and waiting
These niggas are mistakin
You don't speak my language
Dressed like Ma cambridge
Bowtie make me muslim
Switch for suspenders
Two at least
Clickin through our hyperbeast
Tom Brown, Hells Bells, Kitsune, Jay L
I don't wear your shirt unless it got a logo
Now it's to go out and walk around soho
All high schools showing out, Pay less.
Man fuck that, yo I earned this.
I love clothes.
Go to top man
That's the hot spot
Check Kayne's blog for the high tops
Check shake appeal lookbook right quick
They hooking up with ambush, that's it
Spare a top cider with a black trim
Pink leather jacket, gotta get him
New t-shirt and I put it all
On a charge card
Burning through my go yard
And it's so dumb, but it's so tight
Ain't nothing like new shoes every night
And it feels so good in the new jeans
And the new shirt, it's addicting
I'm an addict
I don't want help, I'm a die in my brand new Louis belt.
But not Louis, it's too gaudy
Check the lime green frames this girl bought me
Billionaire boys club, I'm living it
One shirt, eight dubs
I'm spending it
Got shoes that I know I won't wear
And the problem is I don't really care
Got money, but nothing is forever
Every time I gotta buy I new sweater
By 211 I'll be dead broke
I'll be the homeless dude in a peacoat."

All my fans love me
Dad is proud of me
Momma cries for me
'Cause she know there ain't sleep in my schedule
Having nightmares that I'm the black Heath Ledger
Sleep when I'm dead
These voices in my head
Got me waking up at 4 just so I can write instead
And my friends come and ask me if it's worth it
I tell them that it better be, I did this shit on purpose
The worst is being worthless
Now a nigga priceless
Bloomingdales coat, I don't have to check the prices
But I only go to feel a sense of control
'Cause I get this shit for free if I wear promotional
And I'm not emotional
When I do my work
I get emotional when I order that dessert
'Cause she always ate dessert
And I deserted her
But I refuse to compromise career for a girl
Cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul
And if I let it go, there'd be no one left to know
Being happy is the goal, but greatness is my vision
And all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition
But baby I am different
This shit is my life
And if you don't believe me, you can never be wife
I'm walking in this darkness and I'm tryna find a light
And I'd rather die than be average and chances are I might, because
Things are changing, my life ??????
Thirteen cities in the last eight weekends
All I know is baby I'm so tired
Record on Monday,
Tape on Tuesday,
I ain't slowing down I don't care what you say

Mr. Jens Lekman on the track, ladies and gentlemen
For those of you wondering for whom the sample is
All right. Let's do this. Uh-huh
(Verse 1: Childish Gambino)
I'm the sickest Nigga ever, go and tell your ma!
And I got a little liquor like a St. Bernard!
Niggas hold onto Cliffs, like Phylicia Rashad!
'Cause I'm always on the edge, but I don't fall off!
I's a boy in the hoodie and a hat to match!
And the shit bright orange like a pumpkin patch!
And they call me Guy Ritchie 'cause I work with snatch!
And I'm rich, and a guy. Whatch'all think of that?
And the cops stay on me 'cause I'm young and black!
And the boy stay crazy like a pound of crack!
And I'm all that jazz like my name was scat!
College dudes like me too love my name Borat!
And I like my girls thick like chocolate, fat like my wallet
I'm tellin' y'all the truth, like a prophet
And if Gambino on the track, you should copy it
And all y'all Niggas totin' guns need to stop it
I'm so focused. Yeah
I'm so focused. Yeah. (We don't play around like that. Listen.)
We ain't scared a you! Tell them other muthafucka we prepared for you! Ungh!
We ain't scared a you! Tell them other mutha f- we prepared for you! Ungh!
(Verse 2: Truff Syrum)
Before you even know how long this song lasts
You'll be reelin' and feelin' so flabbergasted
Like a fast pass that you can't catch, I'll leave you blasted
Lambasted, like I doused you in acid
I could be takin' some comedy and I'm makin' that tradic
Like I spin, 'cause I hocus, I focus, I'm flippin' it back and now it's magic
And the beat go from cool, like plan is to janet, to dammit!
Cuties cute in to inspect my go-go gadget
Why? 'Cause I spit in split time. It's a sign of a double wear prada I'm reachin'
I'm teachin' 'em for a while that you can't deny I'm alive
So existential, my rhymes are quintessential
I'm an educated black and that's a fact. I'm presidential
One riff, and I'm siftin' through N-s lies
Got a gift to keep my eyes on the prize, you best move to the side
'Cause I'm goin' for the gold, I'm a stone solider
Gambino told you Jokers that I'm so, so, so foc- I'm so FO-cusssssssed
(Verse 3: Childish Gambino)
I'm all grown up, but I'm still Childish
It's crazy to think that all them days is behind us
I remember when n-s tried to stop us
Now them same n-s on my dick and try for profit
This is what I asked for. It comes with the territory
This isn't a cry for help, ain't no pinnochio story
I'm in it just for the glory - I'm in this to win it, babe

And I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol,
Cause this shit hurts,
Call it the uncle curse,
But I'm livin' for the moment,
Not the long haul,
And I refuse to slow down until its last call,
Erica Keeps telling me to grow a conscience (?),
And treat women like money, no object,
But these hoes are a much different story,
Straight laced chicks,
Don't do nothin' for me,
I'm in a weird place,
I got a little money,
But money won't buy you time,
If all the time is runnin' from me,
There's so much I wanna do,
Like write a script or write a book,
Get an hour on HBO, and date a girl that likes to cook,
And stop havin' all of these crushes,
On all of my friends girlfriends,
I think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends,
It looks nice, I gotta get me one of those,
I haven't found Mrs. Right,

And even when you laughed, you cried
And even when you were sad, you were really happy
'Cause you were here
And I got to meet every star, every planet
Everything that made me
And we all kissed
And became the same
We became the same
We became the same

Why try at all?
Why bother?
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling

It would be some type of meanness to where you are

And no one else seems to know

Nobody think about it worst case, uh
Best case, we the front page, uh

Yeah, motherfucker, take your phone out
To record this
Ain't nobody can ignore this
I'm more or less, a moral-less individual
Making movies with criminals
Tryin' to get them residuals

When I hear that action, I'm a be Scorcese

My girl ain't bad, she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?
She on Hollywood and Vine
Thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk
But I saw through it like a wet shirt
Drive slow 'cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops till they stop
When I heard shots
Watchin' dude drop from a Glock at a
Let me flash on 'em

Saying that you never date older dudes
Why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a grove with no kids
Can't hold his goose

Crafmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Crying 'cause I'm stressed. TMJ or TMI
It's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost God never pray, forgotten us
Lost love, never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watchtower
Any anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait until I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and I finish it

Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha-
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean where's the line between Donnie G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re up
Tequila in the cantina, thirty dollars I swallowed
The sauce was so malo then she said ""you need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song""
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's the Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone - now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden this burden, hurtin', they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying 
Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out; ""it's the best,"" no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make 'em believe in themselves, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, keeling myself, no one's ever been this lost
I just get the information retweeted or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he moves with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make 'em dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces are shit with breakfast
Funny, the day you born that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
Plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talking to eat, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas taking props like a musical live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her 
She text me 
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass, 
Texts said ""I'm Wet"", I said 
H2O plus my D, that's the hood I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gonna reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
Life's the biggest troll but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up
You're here now, you have to help me
You have to help me

And we can do the same thing if you wanna have better
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic

Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try
Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone

So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother

Maybe we can do it without any spite

Have you ever made out with a Gap ad?
And girls want what they can't have
So I don't text back when the screen flash
You love me, you mean cash
Need a friend you can fuck, I can be that
Crush girls now, couldn't last year
Oh, you like me now, well that's weird
Last year you were chilling with Lil Wayne
Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same?
My work is my playtime
I need you to understand and to stay fine
Do this and I just might wife you
Let me poke-ya-mom, Raichu

I don't really think I drank enough tonight
Looking at you, make me wanna fuck for life
Lame-ass dudes gon' suck tonight
But so are these girls, am I wrong or right?
Girl, do somethin' to me

Y'all girls have never been good for me
Watch a nigga take over, mutiny
I wanna fuck with the lights on
Hey, girl, let a python slide on
Stay sick, infect me, Lysol

I'm chillin' with this Asian chick I met in Chicago
She look like the Social Network chick
Except for her ass is twice as thick, man

Where the fuck did my license went?
I musta left it at the other place
I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space
Yeah, we doin' stupid shit, have stories when I'm older
But I don't wanna see pictures of us on Vulture
Never thought about a year ago
I'm chillin' out with the friends at the Super Bowl
Things change like a motherfuck
That's why I wild out, keep the city up
Uh, I talk a lot about the girls in my songs
But you are different from the girls in my songs
Stop talking about the girls in my songs
If you don't like it, I can just take you home
More green than the top of these tree trunks
Leave you boyfriend here, 'cause he punk
She like, ""I'm not a slut,"" speed bump
By the way, what's your name, 'cause we drunk

And I thought that sex was when you touched a girl's butt
You could get a girl pregnant, so look, but don't touch
I like you so much, I know it sound crazy
But I'd have a sex change just so I could have your baby
The roles are reversed, so you got a huge dick, and I got a Prada purse
A nigga so sick, that my car's a doctor
Take a gamble on a nigga that your name was Proctor
Kick it in Chinese like you're Shaolin soccer
Got nothin' but dinero, so you meetin' the Fockers
Look at my clock-ers, it's time to roll out
Get sneaks, sneaks, and sneaks, and they sold out
That's what I'm all about and if you got the time

All my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy
Rap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy
I got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Young Bino, we be mobbin'
You don't see me, I'm on an island
These haters left us no choice
Leave the trap like so moist
Little rock like dope boys
Oh my God, I'm out of fucks
Colombian but she ain't a plug
That's racist
In '96 I had K-swiss
You 96 with some fake bitch
And I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language
Head game so Cambridge
God damn, you dirty bitch
You were lettin' me bust in it
But if they ask I plead the fifth
Ok this the part where I need y'all to make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding

But I'm not goin' back, not goin' back, baby
Please tell me you don't want me to fail
'Cause I'm not goin' back, not goin' back
I could've been a tragedy
That's why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me
'Cause they ain't have the smarts or the heart
Ain't you read the fuckin' book, 'Things Fall Apart'?
I was never gonna stay the same
All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kickin' ass and takin' names
Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
Callin' me the new Will Smith, that's Jaden
Callin' me a faggot when I'm rappin', that's hatin'
I need to slow down, what the fuck is y'all sayin'?
Step inside the party, y'all niggas is mood killers
My lifestyle simple, live easy and Bruce Willis
I'm the boss, Michael Scott, y'all bitches is just Phyllis
Set the world on fire, y'all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?
That's why these fuckin' MCs want their asses back
Don't you know that I'm a rapist, ask a track
Whiskey sippin', wanna drink the whole bottle
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
Fuckin' hate me, that's what I'm used to
Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil
Goddamn, man, there's gotta be a better way
Than pill poppin' all these drugs so I can stay awake
Like I'm Jessie in this bitch, I'm so excited
There's a party at the top, you ain't invited
But it's lame and all the bitches is fake
You think about your old girl and how breakin' up's a mistake
Black dudes assume I'm closeted or kinda gay
White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey
IAmDonald is a full-time job
These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off

Dirty girls love my dick, they're cockroaches
Jewish girls eat my meat, it's not kosher
Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee
Got nothin' against the sistas, I just don't think they're into me
I am not a thug, aka what they pretend to be
I am just myself, aka my worst enemy
Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fuckin' knife
I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight
It's cool though, it's all good
You want a dude who keep it real and stay hood
I'm sorry, babe but I act me
I don't act black, whatever that be
I'm just happy these girls seem into me now
Yeah, they lookin' for some In-N-Out, animal style
With this lettuce, cheese, bread, makin' sandwiches
That's why you niggas fail like all of your parents' marriages
Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
She said to write her somethin' nice on the next track
But she cute so I wrote her ass a whole rap
Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb
Believe me it was bad, we're better off, you're welcome
I worked hard on that song like day and night
That whole song made this one verse crazy, right?
I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that
Like that bullshit you talked before Culdesac
I didn't know he had it in I'm
Couldn't see me as Spider-Man but now I'm spittin' venom
Now you payin' attention, pick your fuckin' face up
When I wanna be a superhero I just wake up
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
I refuse to go back to not likin' who I was because
Fake love, these fake dreams, these fake sounds
All the things that we felt, your voice was screaming too loud
I know what you're ready to be but it isn't with me
So I'm ready to leave you alone
I don't really wanna fight like this, I don't ever wanna lose your kiss
All I ever wanted was someone to hold on to
I just wanna be your girl, everything you haven't heard
Plus, I just wanna be with you

I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
Childish Gambino
I'm trying to hold my liquor
A vomit stain on my t-shirt
A sick boy but getting sicker
I don't really wanna take another marijuana
But I do it 'cause I'm stupid and it hits me I'm a goner"
81,Outside,2011,Camp (2011),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"I used to dream every night, now I never dream at all
I'm hopin' that it's 'cause I'm livin' everything I want
I used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights, putting on a stone face
He's saving up so we can get our own place
In the projects, man that sounds fancy to me
They called me fat nose, my mom say you handsome to me
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood they think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit
But all they get now is, ""Can your son read this script?""
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
We can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
No one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
We can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
No one knows
Yeah
Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face, she still made dinner
""Donald watch the meter so they don't turn the lights off""
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He's supposed to pay 'em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads under the pillow
Like that would do somethin'
But she's got six kids, she's gotta do somethin'
She don't want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad cause his father ain't around
He lookin' at me now, like
""Why you so fuckin' lucky? I had a father too
But he ain't around so I'mma take it out on you""
We used to say ""I love you,"" now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you're the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over, I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are because you're young and black
Don't believe 'em
You're still that kid that kept the older boys from teasin'
For some reason
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
We can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
No one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
We can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside
No one knows
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

Oh, baby baby baby"

One, two, three, check it out
On the road to sandwiches and chicken wings
Phat people do phat things
Using salt and pepper for their seasonings
Phat people do phat things
Check it out
It's B to the I to the double L-Y
My friends all know I'm not an ordinary guy
I like little things, like chicken wings
BBQ sauce, honey mustard, onion rings
And when my cell phone rings it goes jingle-jing
I say hello, I say hello, I say who this be?
They say it's Fancy Ned, I got a fancy head
I'll eat a fancy ass sandwich on some fancy ass bread
(Verse 2: Childish Gambino)
The wait is over, shut up, bend over
I hang with bar stools, I chill with Grover
The boy Ebola, my boy phat too
And my girl so phat that they call her Oprah
I got that green like a bowl of okra
Loose change so phat can't fit my sofa
I head to the bank, call the shit my grocer
It's Sex in the City, get the phat mimosa
Me and B, we phat boys, hang with phat girls
Driving phat toys, fuck Dan Aykroyd
I'm live on a Saturday night
I got two phat girls, I'm doing it right
Like my name John GoodmanExplain
I got the phat crib so I'm doing real good, man
And I'm up to no good, man
This is how I get phat, call the shit cooking
Phat people do phat things
(Verse 3: Billy Scafuri)
I tip waitresses, I tip scales
My style is kind of phat like an Orca whale
I'm sipping whole milk as I stare
Thinking I can be your Oprah, you can be my Gail
'Cause I am a phat boy, never been to Bally's
Married to this phat life, call me Kirstie Alley
Married to the snack life, counting every calorie
Might just open up a phat boy art gallery
(Verse 4: Childish Gambino and Billy Scafuri)
What else you do, B?
I'll make it easy
What else you do, B?
For girls to squeeze me
I'm phat but my numbers run
Listen son, I'mma show them how it's done
When my swagger weighs a ton
Stickin' straws inside of girls, you can call me the Capri Sun
(Verse 5: Childish Gambino)
I make the girls drip, so I guess I eat Gushers
Screaming out yeah like I'm eating out Usher
In your dad's bedroom where I fuck you
Knockin' on the door, so you're screaming out ""nothing""
But they all know it's something
You didn't think I'd tear the pussy up, did you pumpkin?
But better and better like Benjamin Button
(Verse 6: Billy Scafuri)
I hang out with Chester Cheeto
Cooler than the ranch on your Dorito
Hotter than the peppers in your burrito
Getting cheddar and cream, if you know what I mean
(Verse 7: Childish Gambino)
Yeah, I know what you mean, home girl mistaken
She think Gambino won't bring home bacon
Or bring home Swiss cheese, my dough got holes
Cause all these hoes want shoes and nice clothes
They want the Macy's, the Neiman Marcus
The Fendi purses, the Gucci parkas
I know you want it, don't get me started
They see Gambino and they act retarded
Phat people do phat things
(Outro: Billy Scafuri)
Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks
Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks
Eat snacks coming out of packs
Guaranteed to put a little fat on your back
Eat snacks"

I used to walk on the beach at night. I remember. The best time was when, well, me and you, we got all our friends and we got a tent. We slept in it. Not the whole night, but just enough time. Magic happened, nothing was born luckily. It's up to me, but then we left. The times have changed. The pleasures that I feel. They say you never say never, it's real. Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep. I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep. I'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room.

It's easy when you
Let go, let go
Didn't mean to make you nervous

You can be the moon to me
And I can be your spotlight (spotlight)
And if you think I'm ballin'
You shoulda seen me last night, last night
Fuck that, fuck y'all and the po-po's
Down under, surfin' on the gold coast
I'm looking for the truth in a blunt
And I ain't got a home
Let's stunt
So baby if you feel like you wanna leave
I ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles
The game ain't easy
We both deserve a little bit of timeout
We can go together

Gotta let you know

I murdered the dish, I eloped with the spoon
Tri-coastal and the third coast is the moon
When it hits your eye like a get in your eye thing
And we do the I like you like like you like like thing
I can't promise I won't be dressed like a viking
When I do the whole picking you up on my bike thing
Another white rapper's CD in my spokes
I would swear y'all converted to rap for the jokes
I spit black smoke, I'm the hip hop pope
They make anti-me PSA's 'cause I'm dope
And when it's not clear you can cope, the worlds a negative iPod
You just hear 'nope'
Nights on the pavement, you just stop breathin'
On some Liz Lemon movin' back to Cleveland
Street lights people, up and down the boulevard
Don't stop believin in your journey, and I know it's hard
They call me Violet Beauregard, 'cause I just blow up, no regard
All I really need is a bar to belly up to
A balcony, a star crossed lover to yell up to
So what are you up to? This weekend I'm free
Till then I'll just shine and let you find meExplain

I run on these rappers so skip the stromboli
I make these niggas say 'Great' like Tony
So how the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me?
How the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me
When you all on the tip of my dick like Moby
The wait is over, no baking soda
I saw them dudes move bricks and boulders
I saw them dudes move flats and corners
And they moved that sugar like Russell Stover
I got that green like a four leaf clover
Get rich or die tryin' like my name two quarters
Dope boys they get me, we got the same hustle till the tank on empty
And if you dope boy, better watch the Wire
And get the shit straight, turn back, retire
'Cause one in a mil turn snow to fire
You either move weight, play ball or neither

This is on a bus back from camp. I'm thirteen and so are you.
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble. It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That's you.
And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us. We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles. I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you, but I don't know if you do or don't more-than-like me. You've never said.
So I haven't been saying anything all summer, content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on. A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh, is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh, but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be. A girl who reads books that no one's assigned to her, whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet.
Back in the real world we don't go to the same school, and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood, we won't go to the same high school. So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something. And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something.
The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep. We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know. And then I'm like, ""Can I tell you something?""
And all of a sudden I'm telling you. And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway. And there's no expression on it. And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven't said ""yes"" or ""no"" yet. And regrettably I end up using the word ""destiny."" I don't remember in what context. Doesn't matter.
Before long, I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, ""okay."" I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive and I would leave in order not to spoil the moment, but there's nowhere to go because we're are on a bus. So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am.
I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore. The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on. I turn and you're not there. Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore. We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church. The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now, your bags and things piled high in the trunk. The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus, just as one of them reaches my row. It used to be our row, on our way off.
It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head. Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise. She stops and looks down at me. And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face, but I can see her smile. And she says one word: ""destiny."" Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads
Them off the bus. I didn't know you were friends with them.
I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over. So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts.
This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad, this is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not, I'm just saying it's what I learned.
I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody. So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always. Everybody can't turn around and tell
Everybody. Everybody already knows, I told them.
But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you. Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose. I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit. But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus. I still haven't."
99,The Awesome,2009,Poindexter (2009),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"(Hook: MC Chris)
I am the awesome
You see me flossin', watch me walk upon your face
Make that incision
I leave you itchin' just to join my monster race
Say I'm just messin'
Yeah well I'm pissed and I can keep an even key
You think you know me
But you can blow me cause you don't know how I feel
(Verse 1: Childish Gambino)
It's Childish Gambino, ho
What you know about that?
Niggas 'fraid to go outside, they some house cats
'Cause if they see me, they might have to act right
I'm livin' life right, like I got a past life
Boy I got a flashlight
Check my fuckin' hoodie skin
Like God was makin' light and threw my hoodie in
Bambi, naw nigga that's my pseudonym
Call me Elroy
Nigga we some hooligans
And just in case, I keep a million in the glove box
Blast this shit from in your car to make the hood rock
Ice cold, bright colors, like a juice pop
And if you try to touch my shit I'll make your juice pop
Yes I get a two spot just for fuckin' showin' up
Boy it's me, T.N.T., boy I'm blowin' up
Nigga throw it up
Boy, I am the awesome
Call me Elroy
Or Mr. ""Hey, how much it cost him?""
(Hook: MC Chris)
(Verse 2: MC Chris)
Okay!
Rackin' 'em, stackin' 'em, packin' these ballers
Readin' these, beatin' these hoes like Carver
Whittle like cardboard, steady like barbers
I'm back and forth from the front to the starboard
Back up Marlin, it's only a suit
Like high torch 'cause he ain't get the boot
Like fly gossip, birds in the zoo
Cause the underground sound I'm reiteratin through
Once I'm in the mad loop, what a real man do
With a cannibalistic crew, when they runnin' on the loose
Can't handle the truth, like a fart to a scoop
Put my hand on the mic and my mind on the loot
Crime to duke, ridin' away
I'm a dick snub that you bothered to say
I get krunk then the car pull away
Now don't get sick got the shit on spray, okay?"
100,The Last,2010,Culdesac (2010),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"I'm the last of a dying breed,
Meaning that I'm not afraid to try new things,
Can't see me best to get yourself some Visine,
Toe tag a motherfucker no jokes, while these other niggas wakka wakka
Other rappers try and go and get over
You want that hood shit best to go and call Hova
I was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder
98 test score in my Thundercat folder
My cousin was older
My momma used to wake up,
Drive me to a school cause the school was much safer
But I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher
Now I'm going to a school where I get beat up because
I ain't get down with them other kids
Probably 'cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there (?)
Momma couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there
Guest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom
Now I'm going to this school called Rock Ridge
School of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in
There's not a lot of black kids,
So I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne, but really
What I wanna know is why I never fit in right
Like a fat dude getting on a packed flight
Even when I make friends in the hallways
I'm wishing I was someone else always
But I'm happy that that shit happened to me
Cause it taught me most important is to do me
Cause everybody hates you till they love you
Facebook niggas same niggas that would shove you
Cause nobody was jocking my style
I had a high voice, they called me faggot eight mile
So I stopped writing for a very long time
Thinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes
And this next part, sounds like nonsense
But I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence
Taught me everything that is good comes from honesty
Everybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it
She on a role model shit
From the day that I shook her hand
I knew that I'd never die a broke man
So I could try this rapping shit out again
The game need change, I'm a part of it
People tell me I should spit under Donald Glover
But I try to keep my real name undercover
'Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes
And I can't go for that, nigga Hall and Oates
My nigga stay down like a winter coat
I rap about my life not ""I'm On A Boat""
Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand
Only ones who do it well's Lonely Island
Save the raps about your cat, I am not a fan
Leave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here
I do not play around with this bullshit,
I am different, call it new shit
Labels want me to hurry and cash my check in
But I keep my shit free till the last possible second
Cause God knows that I don't need the money
You get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?
But this limelight burn like a motherfuck
I wanna call my dad crying but I hang up
'Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit
So I send him a check and tell him to hold it
If anything ever happens want you to know this
I always took the time to smell the roses
And wherever I am, I am doing fine
I'm here for a good, not a long, time"
101,The Palisades,2014,STN MTN / Kauai (2014),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"Oh no no, yeah
I know the secret we share
Look what this feeling has done to me
There's something deep in the air
Just hope your hands lift me comfortably
I don't know why but every time I see you smiling
I'm tired of running tired of playing tired of hiding
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me
(I'm just playing tho)
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
I think there's something for us
Lying around as the world comes down
If you understand what I'm saying
You won't end up in the lost and found, nope
I don't know why but every time I see you dancing
(I see you dancing)
I'm tired of running tired of playing late romancing
(I don't want to)
If we could be together would that make you happy?
(I don't fuck with that)
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Now why can't everyday be like this
Smoke a J at the beach like this
Hang with bae at the beach like this
Conversations with Kish like this (hey!)
Never thought it could be like this
Be the man like I am like this
Dance around shake your hips like this
Mess around make a hit like this

Hell yeah I do it bigger
I got eight figures like I'm skatin' in the winter
Niggas thought that I was kiddin'
These raps are not my sketches
I'm a sick boy, nigga, when I cough I hope you catch it
My germs in your system, now you coughin' like asthmatic
All of my ""I'm tired of it"" turns into your ""Wish I had it""
I don't need this money, but I spend it like I wanna
She said this dick is hers, I don't wanna take it from her
Your dick stay chilly, it's a cold, rough world
I get superhero pussy, she a PowerPuff Girl
Shit just got real like Pinocchio turds
Yo nigga is Geppetto, I don't want no instrumentals
Leave the vocals on my shit
Like the song givin' me head
And your bitch can't sleep 'cause she used to my bed
She could have any dick, you just mad she chose-d mine
Schoolin' all you niggas and my mouth will make it Columbine
I am just a rapper, man, I ain't got no clothing line
My clothing line has closed the line and let me shop at closing time
Yo boy got stacks like I'm standin' in a Borders line
Hidin' from you bitches 'cause real nigga's hard to find

Closet look like Bloomingdales, yo closet look like fashion jail

This money make me Olsen twins, you call your bitch, you hearin' this
Uh uh uh
Yes it's necessary to be flier than canaries
Stay fresh to death like a mint cemetery
I do not talk, yeah my life a library
Eat her out and leave her cold, make that hole my Ben & Jerry's
Broke the mold on you bitches, man, I am so unique
You are not a rapper, if you were you'd hardly speak
I am Stone Mountain and I haven't reached my peak
Fuck her like I'm mad at her then I turn the other cheek
This shit is amazing, check me in my sweater, man
Comme des Garçons, bitch, nobody do it better, man
But I do it better, man
When it comes to pussy girls whisper in my ear ""No one else can do this to me""
You's a cutie but you gotta know I'm married to my work
And these niggas ain't shit so I guess they must be urine
Gotta gift this bitch, like Christmas, bitch
I'mma act and rap, Will Smith this bitch
When rappers start rappin' over indie shit
Just remember I was first to hit this shit
The difference is I'm different, bitch
How the fuck can these niggas be dickless pricks?
Man, what the fuck you gon' do?
I don't need to talk to you
I am just a rapper too

For a nigga to mature like a glass of fine wine
Ain't no nigga alive can outshine

'Cause I am legend and you just Hitch

Call me Mr. Gambino

So fuck it, I'm a martian, I'm Lilo and Stitch
Niggas say I sound like Weezy and shit
Well he the best in the game so what's wrong with that?
Are you trying to tell me that my rhymes is phat?
Call me Usain Bolt 'cause I run the track
Nigga I'm sick of that
Stop comparing me to people
I know my voice funny like my name John Heder
And I'm out of this world and I'm hot like space heaters
And my girl top down so I call her two seater
My iPhone blast like TNT
I text back to home girl, ""What you know 'bout me?""
I'm in NYC or in ATL
And my wallet stay fat like Kenan plus Kel
Nigga what's that smell, cause my shit don't stink
Cause my shirt bright blue and my shoes hot pink
And I finish this drink that I call a Twin Tower
Two Bud Lights and a whiskey sour
Where I fall down, that shit is ground zero
Little kids saying, ""There goes my hero!""

Mr. DNA, flow so Jurassic
Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic
Damn right we got a t-rex, I paid for that in plastic
Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic
Mistake still burning but I'm learning like a raptor
Take what I'm given make it work like an adapter
Make short work of her, then I will adapt her
Critics all agree it was the work of a master
At last my success will match my fatigue
And at last I'll send my children to an ivy league
In the masks from The Strangers, freak the whole place out
Get your glasses on, girl, geek your whole face out
Don't open up your mouth unless to let something great out
And that's not a beef, that's just a peek at the steakhouse
A week at my maid's house to recharge my battery
Then I'll be right back on top like Slattery
You know from Sterling and Cooper
If she's paid out then I will recoup her
And if she's paid out then I will invest
And if she's really played out then I will impress
Wpon her the need to please please me, whoa yeah
Girl I'm on my knees
Ooh, I need it so bad
It's like I work at NORAD
It's DEFCON-5
Go out back to my car and drive
'Cause shit just got real
Take a thirty wreck drive into a field
Pass out in my vehicle
Hope I wake up in a world more agreeable
Hope I wake aboard an unidentified flying object
Or a reject Enterprise
A Starfleet drop out odyssey
A route to cop out galaxies
Till then I'm in the light, right where the moths are
Impressive, depressive I'm a Goth Star.

In my lap
Fuck this track
It goes off beat but I'm on like clap
And dog, you can have my scraps
I'm close to these girls like her tampon flaps
I'm having an effect on the hood like crack
Even though I'm so suburban like a backpack strap
Don't you get it?
Read Ayn Rand
Then you'll understand why they call me the man
I'm just fucking special-er
Different from you other guys
Hating me in high school made me metamorphosize
Kafka-esque
The way I dress I need to send Bo Diddley some checks
On Marc Jacobs, Commes Des Garcon tie
Diddy is my swagger coach
Can't stop, won't stop
Heavy hitter, short stop
Horse face, horse cock
Bouncer, door stop
Tell me when enough's enough
Looking at me warming up
Microwave a nigga flow
Pity y'all don't see me though the rest of y'all already know
I get it like I gotta, man
Flier like a college band
Niggas looking for a deal and I cut out the middle man
Drinking fucking grape juice

Baby, let me make you breakfast, an omelet with some toast
These girls are on my mind, wasn't my design
To be sitting here across from you, pretending I ain't lyin'
I know exactly how you feel
I wanna keep you real
I never thought that I'd be working for the start 'cause
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I will lose it all
I know this thing will never last
I need to tear it all apart
These girls have all the best of me
I bet that I can lose it all
I don't have the heart - fuck it, I don't have the head
Every time that we're apart, someone's sleepin' in my bed
I wanna be alone, I wanna be alone
This fame and fortune shit shows me things I wasn't knownin'
You're my biggest fan, I promise to be there
I wanna be that guy, but I don't think I can
I'm losin' everything, I wanna let it go
I wanna take it right and slow because

Custom birdie green, they on dookie like fire
We the Sick Boi clique [x8]
Sick Boi till I die [x8]
I'm sick like a hospital, whether you're in pain or not
I'm crazy like a swastika, inside of a bagel shop
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch~! Unstoppable
Think of me as hurricanes cause rappers are incomparable
Most of y'all insufferable, soundin like a bored scratch
Rappers are like ants to me, I stab 'em in the thorax
Lyrically a metaphor, Atlanta's only troubador
Face it, only seen by a few like a unicorn
I'm a try to get my swagger right, like I'm Dolemite
Spread it all around to the kids like it's Vegemite
Get the proper etiquette, bitch you from Connecticut!

Bacardi and Coke, black and white cookie
Smokin' in the alley cause you know we're playin' hooky
We're up to no good, please don't tell our mamas

Sick of the old yellow, money like bank tellers
The chicks that I'm with are thicker thank Nutella

Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got a stripper like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?""
I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies
Why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
These they took from the cabinet (woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005
Hold up (hold up)
Hold up (hold up)
Hold up (hold up)
Hold up (hold up)

Hold up (hold up)
Hold up (hold up)
Hold up (hold up)
I used to care what people thought
But now I care more
Man nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore
I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame
We blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine
Or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone
Whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs
Got a lambo like Lebron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk
At least I think so
Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005
Hold up (hold up)
Hold up (hold up)
Hold up (hold up)
Hold up (hold up)

111,We Ain't Them,2012,R O Y a L T Y (2012),Underground Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|R&B|Pop,Donald Glover,"Picking out my fro with my fist comb
I got a tab at the Stone baby, this long
My little brother was having a little trouble
I hope that he doesn't care that it's in this song
Korean town lunchin', talking 'bout how to run things
He said Atlanta wanted something
Waka, Jeezy, and Future got the streets locked down
Copycats making sure Tip keep that crown
I'm fucking 'round with the truth, went to see The Roots
Quest brought me back on stage in a suit
I went hard cause niggas say that I'm soft
Even Black Thought thought I maimed it a little hard, I gotta be honest
Feeling like the other stuff is kinda behind us
Making jokes here and there done got us some dollars
I'm tryna show the whole world what it is and it ain't a game
He said homie stay the course, ain't shit changed
Weird night and everybody was tipsy
Hanging out with Questlove reminiscing 'bout Whitney
He like, ""Man, we can't even make it to 50?!""
That reminds me - I sent a long text message to my mom and pop
I got the same speech when I left 30 Rock
My mom like ""Why you wanna leave a good job?""
My dad like ""Do your thing, boy, don't stop""
Shout out to my nigga Lud, shout out to my nigga Swank
For hanging at the crib and telling me what you think
Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel is real
And never let these white people tell you how to feel
Never let anybody tell you how to feel
I wanted what they had back in the fourth grade
Family vacas, you know I did it all
Just to see my little sis by a waterfall
My great granddad bought his own freedom
Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm
So don't be alarmed - man I'm royalty
Jam of the week, V103
No cosign, no bovine
More swag, pull back on the punchlines
Starving, every track means lunch time
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
Fuck boys chase hype and scrat chicks
And niggas who stopped texting after 1.6
DG Lover ain't nothing to fuck wit'
D-Money ain't nothing to fuck wit'
And what's a leader if he isn't reluctant
Too bad for y'all, I'm blasting off
I'm not Asher Roth, I don't sleep on my bread
Dick riders stay close, I might flash a ball
Sometimes, all this shit make a nigga feel guilty
I used to sleep with them roaches
Back of my mind though, I hope the show gets cancelled
Maybe then I can focus
Hawaii touch down, go ahead baby put your shades on
East Side! East Side to the gravestone!
Brown liquor, but my girl in Bed-Stuy
Nigga, you got Drive like a sale at Best Buy
Hold up, hold up, we can do better
Put my voice on the track, man that shit is much wetter
At the studio at 8 AM
Hit the booth then eat, nigga we ain't them, nigga we ain't them!
Drop a line, it's your Facebook status
Said that shit about a week ago, you still mad at us
If there's something on your chest, nigga let it out
'Cause I'm the best - da da da"

I am so different, being me is like the lottery
I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep
Niggas makin' pottery, but I broke the mold
Now my has got them dancing like I channel Oakenfold
Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
And these hoes are actin' different 'cause I'm Rich comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck
You know I gotta give a fuck
My face is broken out
My shirt is hand-me-down
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shit and lay me out
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new clothes were the potion
'Cause I never felt that good in my own skin
It's probably 'cause I'm the only black kid in my school
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool
'Cause I wear thee tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt
Yeah, I'm self conscious
Go ahead - laugh it up
'Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up
They told my ass to blacken up
What the fuck are you?
You don't even say shit
Quit writing gay shit
Now they see me and have to squint like asians
'Cause I'm on fire and everything I touch is blazing
Giving you the realness
Kid I got a lot of it
Listen to my mixtapes, tell me if they contradict
Don't fuck with these niggas cause this swag is abstinent
I don't have time to eat
I don't have time to sleep
These niggas got time to do
Everything but be unique
I gotta do me like I'm jerkin' in the mirror
I am just a rapper
Can't make it clearer
Yes I'm in the building
No I own the company
Your girlfriend's sister... you cannot fuck with me
Childish Gambino

I am just a murderer
We have just killed them"

Yeah, my stuff big, man
Keep a girl's pussy bright red like a pig's tan
Four shots and watch me lean like a kick stand
I really need to change my name to, ""Hey, I'm a big fan.""
Cause that's all I hear when I'm outside
And my hoodie's never jealous of that tie-dye
Cheesy on the mic, like I'm laying on Jordan
No homo for you niggas homophobic
Yes, I back bend these girls aerobic
And these hoes got a Spiderman like Tobey
Keep these girls wet, call them Lakers like Kobe
Got money trees, asking me, ""Do you row me?""
Latin girls kiss my feet like they're superguh
Latin girls see your face and call you ""Stupida.""

Yes yes yes my wallet's cheesy
Throw your hood up, are you queasy?

Better yet, the century, check the whiskey sour
Lookin' like I'm drinkin' piss
How's he fuckin' thinkin' this
Easy, I'm a mentalist, but I'm not on CBS
Uh, yes it's me Bambe
What is your daughter to do?
I've been doing this ever since Harry Potter was new
Boy! I don't play, I change games, I am too real
So my words stay hard like a blue pillExplain
I like pink, it always looks good on me
And I like pink, it always looks good on me
That second part I was talking about vagina, homie
Fuck the game at an early age, now there hymen on me
Yes, I am a magnet
Yes, I do attract it
Remember when these fake ass niggas called me faggot?
'Cause I had glasses and a pink track jacket
Now those things are assets to help me get some asses
Now these nerdy hoes keep asking me to smash it
Bullies from middle school chatting on my Twitter status
Fuck you, you don't get shit from now on
Unless you got a demo tape, then I can lay some brown on
It's the B to the AMBI, colors like candy
Nigga, I'm the Army. I'm being all I can be
Yes I dress dandy. Get a clue, like the Clandy
I live hard, I never sleep in, like an Amby
This is for the niggas thinkin' different
While their friends are flippin' pigeons in they're stay po-pimpin'
He never lets the best go past him

My verse is pedophiles on the playground, okay now?
