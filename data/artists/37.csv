(Cardo got ranks)
Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib
It was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Play some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you were out of town
Nigga like Biggie heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified, you're better off committing suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See I know how it feel to be platinum plus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO blood money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catchin' the bus
Dark fame is a mothafucka
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny's house
Leave you lyin' like Fif'
How a nigga supposed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walk around the crib like...
Why a nigga can't live? Get this money, fuck these bitches
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like
We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four pounds
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hope I ain't gotta show it
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Yo 40 I'm fucked up
Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100
Thank me later, thanks for nothin'
Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself
Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill, nigga
Know how it feel when you're missin' your nigga though
Can't think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figueroa
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog's name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with me
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter dawg 'cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga
Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100"

2,3D,2011,Purp & Patron (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"Shawty say she wanna love me, she won't leave me alone
She say she wanna tangle no iphone
She wanna get me face time, no iphone
She gotta black berry BBM I'm on
Spinnin bottles of patron what I do for fun.
Take her back to the crib have a two on one
And after she get bent, bend her over like a shot gun,
Tank on E so you know I'm about to pop one.
Looking 3D, ass so fly see it from the front had to walk around the back
Told whatever she want, she know got that
She know I'm a big boy so I gave her 3 stacks
Told her there's a lot more Grey Goose where that came from.
You drinking 'em bottles up, I tell her to back it up,
Then she pull out a blunt where that came from
Now shawty gonna light it up, wanna come fly with us
Shawty I wanna drink, I justa wanna cut
If you see a freak tell her I just in the cut.
Bottles upside down,
And I'm feeling turned up, Body looking 3D
Would she back it up, back it up like this,
Up like that, up like this, up like that
Fuck it up like this, up like that,
Shawty looking 3D would she back it up.
Shawty says she love the way we talk in the south
You can do it too, put it in your mouth,
On the V.I.P. couch, snow in the face, (throwing green?) we suck no waste,
She says she love how it taste point blank range, shoot it in her face
She think I'm running game but game already ran in a marathon
Heard the pussy bomb hiroshima. Aquafina wet, betta splash ass like the Avatar
Big tall blue bitch, 3D camera. And imma Thor on the blue whore.
Pull out the MC Hammer bitch and beat it on the floor.
All these extra spare bottles in the club you can tell me I'm (takin', takin'?)
Me and david banner in the club got the speakers on sub bitches shaking, shaking,
And Game I'm like damn about this brotha on these hoes Pittsburgh pussy taking, taking
Then I might hit it from the back like a Mac now she sayin' that it's achin, achin
I'ma back it up she need a (sad car now?)
(I'mma act it up if it make it hurricane bill?)
I'mma stack it up like an 18 wheeler now.
She can back it up
Call the waiter cause"
3,Ain't Fuckin' with You,2008,LAX (2008),Hip Hop,The Game,"That T.M. shit, that T.M. shit
Trackmasters, that T.M. shit, that shit
That T.M. shit ? Game!
(Chorus: unknown singer (The Game))
I don't care that you lookin' like Beyonce on her best day
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
You got your high heels on and your body feel warm but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
You got your hair did right and your panties too tight but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
Could be another night, girl, but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
(The Game)
I'm tired of playin' your games, you pissin me off
I'm watchin LeBron so holla when this shit go off
You say I be trippin' but really it's you that be gone
Always bringin' up Tanisha be givin' me dome
I ain't tryin' to hear that, I'm just tryin' to chill
So chill, like Chamillionaire or Mike Jones grill
All in front of my flat screen, True Religion black jeans
Dancin like Ciara, I ain't Bow Wow or 50
Tryin' to get me but I back out, I could blow your back out
Lay you down, put it in the hole, like Stackhouse
We used to hit midtown, throwin' all them stacks out
Run through the Louis Vuitton store and clean the racks out
Used to feel good, when I watch your Porsche back out
You bought Keyshia Cole album, now you tryin' to act out
Flippin like a Sidekick, tell me what is that 'bout?
You can't take the heat, get the fuck up out of Shaq house
Black out
(The Game)
Bitch, I'm rollin' 21's and over
Not the club, the dubs on that platinum Range Rover
My neck's so iced out, my wrists so shined up
I make hoes line up, see a pole climb up
Brown sugar or light skin, black or white skin
If she could drop it low then she could be my night friend
Or my one night stand, if she got a nice tan
Before I leave I cut the light off of your nightstand
Back to the house, my girl wanna have real sex
Nah, I keep my kids like Britney Spears' ex
Take her back to the future, I ain't even here yet
And that line was fly, bitch I'm a Leer jet
(The Game)
Stop playin' girl, stop playin'
Stop playin' girl, stop playin'!
Stop playin' girl, stop playin'
I said stop playin', you better stop playin'
'Fore I break you off like a Kit Kat, you know I wanna hit that
Banana split that, but a real nigga had to sit back
Cause that's what we do, when girls be with the chit-chat
Every mornin on ""The View"", them girls be with the chit-chat
Enough with all the riff-raff, let me see your cat walk
I'm old school, Garfield, I can make your cat talk
But I'm a gangsta, so I'ma back off
Keyshia and DMX, I'll leave yo' ass with that thought
For real
That T.M. shit, uh-huh, that T.M. shit
Trackmasters, that T.M. shit, that shit
That T.M. shit ? Game!"
4,Ali Bomaye,2012,Jesus Piece (2012),Hip Hop,The Game,"Get my people out them chains nigga
I mean handcuffs, time to man up
Put my hands up? Fuck you sayin' bruh
'Cause I'm a black man, in a Phantom
Or is it cause my windows tinted
Car cost 300 thou' and I blow Indo in it
You mad cause your daughter fuck with me on spring break
Well, I'm a fuck her till the springs break
Yeah Roll another one 'cause I'm winnin'
And my four door looking real photogenic
Jam 'em on the tire, in threads that won't expire
I'm in a class of my own, my teacher got fired
Money getting long, pussy rate keep rising
Versace outfit cost me 3, 000
From the P houses, did it from the weak hours
Selling that chicken no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power, then you get respect
I'm getting so much money I can buy ya bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women working naked
Fell in love with a waitress what the fuck I'm thinking
Bought that ho a ring it was for her pinky
Uhn, that's pimpin' that's slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent
Fuck y'all mad at me for
Got a black car, and a black phantom
With a white bitch in Idaho, I do the same thing in (Montana)
Got a thick bitch in Atlanta, got a redbone in the Chi
Got two chains, they two-tone, two hundred racks, no lie (true)
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
I'm bout to rumble in the jungle in these new Kanye's
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
My lawyer threw them gloves on and beat another case
Fuck y'all mad at me for, cause my belt got two G's on it
Her belt got two C's on it, my daughter's stroller got D's on it
Free Big Meech, Free Boosie and C-Murder
Like New Orleans, like Baltimore, come to Compton you'll see murders
And my AR see murders, that's beef nigga no burgers
I'm insane and you Usain, nigga better turn on them burners
Got [?], bitch [?]
Got dope to sell in this hotel, no half price, no retail
You a bitch nigga, no female, I smack niggas, Sprewell
I'm on the block like D 12, I got the white, no D-12
Like a little nigga in Africa, I was born toting that K
And that's real shit, no Will Smith, and no [?]
But they yellin'...
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle fuck it let 'em spray
I take my case to trial, hire the Dream Team
Robbie Kardashian, Johnnie Cochran, I seen things
I dream big, I think sharp
Inhale smoke, Hawaiian tree bark
Humble yourself, you not a G, keep it one with yourself
Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf
I got rifles with lasers, swing it just like the majors
Hit you right above navel, now you swimming in pavement
Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settling for less, I call 'em bottom shelf
Niggas tough on them blogs and never did nothing at all
On the road to the riches, bitches not tagging along
Unless it's ass in a thong, hit that ass and I'm gone
Disrespect my nigga Boss and I'm flashing the chrome
I'm waving the Tec, Tity spraying the Mac
Extendos in the back, gonna lap [?]
Got a bitch that look like Laila Ali sitting in my lap
Got a call from Skateboard, pick 'em up at Lax
Speaking skateboards, where Tune at?
Fuck with him, I'll break a skateboard on a nigga back
2 Chainz!
Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie, No Lie already got a plaque
Mama got a house, daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with a ounce
Bad bitches and D-boys, we bring 'em out
If them niggas pussy, we douche 'em, we clean 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence, if you got work
Go to work the work at your residence...
... For presidents
Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent
Riding through the jungles in that muthafuckin' elephant
That's a gray ghost, with the ears on it
Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the muthafuckas in, made another mill'
Got a nigga feeling like Cassius Clay
Thrilla in Manilla, nigga want it whip his ass today
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle fuck it let 'em spray"

All I know is this pain in this life
And this struggle it troubles me so
All I know is that I'm stuck on this road
Of success so I got to get mine
All I know is this pain in this life
And this struggle it troubles me so
All I know All I know
Red phantom, they say I look like Josh Smith from Atlanta

He from the G.A., and I'm M easy, that's Game
I don't do what you niggas do, that's lame
I So Woo with my crew from the from the Burque
I So Woo with my crew, from under Young Wayne
A walkin' motherfuckin' flame
Livin' up to my brothers name
Rockin' that red shit, wasn't fuckin' with them other gangs
Most other gang's, they wasn't fuckin' with me
Ain't your average motherfucker, I'm a motherfuckin' G
I got some shit on my chest that I want to get off
I got some shit for that vest that will knock that bullshit off
Money like Madoff, Kill 'em like Adolf, Roy Halladay
I'll let a fuckin' K off, and I don't take a fucking day off...
Cincinnati C hat, Boston B hat, them is me hats to Philadelphia P hats
Believe that; bring it to the hood so you can see that
Dumb ass niggas like game, Where the keys at?
Automatic start, nigga where the trees at?
Red boned bitch like Alisha, where the keys at?
Freeze that, like a fucking picture
If you ain't a blood I ain't fucking with ya na I'm just fucking with ya
Stay on my hood shit, hop in the bucket with ya
Throw the ski masks on and get to straight fucking with ya
Ain't that some shit, that bastards sick
You wana know how I'm livin' nigga ask your bitch
Told you precisely how the Aston sit, and she a nasty bitch
I came in her mouth ask her lips, you know why?
'Cause I had to go past them lips, Trick
You probably paid for those ass and tits for...
Fuck with the blood clock, smile for my mug shot
Can't go out like 'em but I love Big, I love Pac
Love Fab, love kis that's where the love stops
'Cause I sleep with the enemy and I hug blocks
Birthed me in the drug spot, nigga with a attitude
Searching me and it's
Fuck cops, nigga pay your gratitude
Before you say I'm acting Ruth
Understand I'm tryna feed my people
Hati just like Compton the way I'm packing food
But I will act a fool, put cheese on your head
Motherfucker I will Green Bay Packer you
Have a whole football team of niggas after you
Like the punt return, when will you fucking learn
Now take your ass back to school
Wait till 3-o-clock click clack at you
And fuck with your conscience like back packers do
And I ain't Talib, Black Thought or Mos Def
But I've seen the most deaths
And nigga I'm just telling you"
6,All That (Lady),2012,Jesus Piece (2012),Hip Hop,The Game,"You know I love you like cooked food, I'm a good dude
Let's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin' tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin' Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, fuck with me and you're famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she's away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yeah my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we'd grew into, whatever we into
That's too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug, yeah she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let's be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I'm a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain't got no room for her name but I'm a make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said ""I'm glad you ate it, where my cap and gown?""
Told her ""I can be your chauffeur, "" dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that's my M.O
Redbone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that
Look, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I'm looking down from Heaven screaming ""Oh, Hell no!""
When you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain't feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life
'Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain't on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me
'Cause she know me
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that
I'm feeling your style
I'm loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You're killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills, girl
You all that"
7,All the Way Gone,2011,The R.E.D. Album (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"(Mario)
Just me and you girl... Whoa
(Game)
She leave her hair in the sink
She leave her hair on the floor
Her hair all over the bed, that make me love her more
She wear a scarf, Louis V to be exact
It's a wrap, messing up her wrap, blowing out her back
Never let another rap nigga hit it from back or the front
On my mama nigga, I be gone for months
I come back
(Mario)
And it's still tight, I like when it's real tight
(Game)
I'mma lick in circles now...
(Mario)
Tell me what that feel like
(Game)
Feels like when you try them red bottoms on
It feels like the song 'cause we all the way gone...
Between me and you, do anything for old girl
Like hit it in the morning, yeah, Cole World
(Hook - Mario)
Baby you're the one
You ain't gotta hit the club no more
'Cause we done did that
Tryna find the one
But you been looking for love in all the wrong places
Every day's a movie, girl, you make the scene
They gon keep on watching, give 'em something to see
We gonna be all the way gone
We gonna be all the way gone
(Wale)
She call me all the time, I ain't no regular Joe
I be staying at the Roosevelt more than Marilyn goes
I'm messing bitches with Chuck, but I was wearing some Foams
Shorty been fly forever, these bitch's parachutes broke
TC's is on her person I'm aware that you know
And you know the flow, they jack it, I'm apparently cold, you know
Life's lemons is bitter, I need another fruit
She know we can't elope, look at what honey do
Straight G thing, double M G thing
Weed they can't fuck with, I'm puffin A.C. Green
When I peep in the public, bet I'm leaving with something
And I'm so fly I make some homebodies ?? leave the luggage
Shout out Donny Sublime
Shout out Bobby on Hundreds
Not too many is touching, double M G this summer
The RED album, lil red shortie, you can't touch her
I know Mario's on the hook, but I was playing Duck Hunt
(Hook - Mario)
(Game)
Yeah, he blowing up your cell phone
Send him the voicemail 'cause we all the way gone
And you ain't doing nothing wrong
But killing the competition in that Cosabella thong
Turn to the side, let me see them thighs
Profile, damn I'm digging your style, we can start slow now
Then speed it up, this playing in the background
While I beat it up - I beat it up
(Mario)
Baby soon as we get home, it won't take us too long
We gon make it to the bedroom, I like the guest room
You can pick the next room
Put the camera on the tripod, got me playing on your iPod
I know you feeling me on my job: Director
(Game)
Cut!"
8,Angel,2008,LAX (2008),Hip Hop,The Game,"Ange... angel... ange... angel)
Verse 1 - Common
I spent my day so,
First I pray yo, then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my lil' angel, reminded me to stay playful
Faitful walks I take in the woods,
Thinkin' what's good, things that I can't change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm ressurectin the peace
Pipes the Indians used to like, we called it chief, right
Stepping on the leafs right, to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in amsterdam, man, bike pedaling
To the nature spot, to taste the flavors they got
My eyes drop, I like it alot... yeah, an angel
I wanna turn up the sound, and spread my wings because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi, make me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ooh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)
Verse 2 - The Game
Th-the way that I rhyme, loc, is mine
Like the first time you heard Mary J and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin' with Common looking for Chicago zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a street disciple
Rockin' every jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly 'cause the angel dust was fuckin' with my third eye
So I start hip hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had, had
But I used the rubber, 'cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance, and she took Big down
I should've knew it, shot G, and 'Pac told ya she get around
Verse 3 - The Game
(Fly away, fly away)
My love for her's not about jewelry or cars
I love her 'cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barington Levy was sayin'
Diddly Whoa!
I got love for the streets, peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was ducking cops, gunshots, I used to be an LA Dodger, now I'm a (angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car, and the rims, we got alot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin', we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Cesar, but got it wrong
'Cause they tryna wire phones, I'm talkin' Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley, in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track
Outro - Common
Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene, L-A and the Chi as a team
Yeah, angel supreme, yeah, keep on
Yeah, its for the world boy, we do it forever, yeah"
9,Anything You Ask For,2006,G.A.M.E. (2006),Hip Hop,The Game,"Huh, niggaz think they got the game sewed, yeah right
I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navy outside, I might be there
Black hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs
Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare
You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear
And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead
Then I'm goin' goin', back back
To the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns
'Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots
I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX
Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box

Count rubber band grands
I'm out big on the under, with my fam bam
And I, hover the lands
To expand, I'm from the gutter grime and the sand
No jams the flam's all busted
The dames want the bucks when, they see you stuffed in
Your pockets, till they get them some
But testin' my pocket, only gets you none
'Cause I, got a pimp mentality
The scrubs wanna eat shrimp and get my salary
They ain't knowin' I'm tight laced in my shoestrings
Hate the way I'm flowin' on the mic 'cause I do gleam
All types of baguettes and bezels
We shine like life's {unverified} rebels
2005, me and my crew just pile the pots
Move like the ice loose, pimp these thangs to watch

But I'm just trying to get my money right,
Soon as I'm done we can take a flight
So I can take you all around the world.
Planes, Trains, Automobiles, Bentley or a Range,
Chromed out wheels, First class ticket, G-4 you the deal,
For real, I can take you all around the world.
She like black Bentley coupes, Black daytons,
Black interior, Black ridin' shotgun,
Black 4.5, Black Air Ones,
Bangin' the Black Album, Track number 1,
She like that Jay shit, That's her favorite,
If it's gonna get me the pussy, I'ma play that shit,
If she bite too hard, I'ma say that shit,
But don't bite me bitch, I don't play that shit,
Marques Houston I don't play that shit,
By the time we got half way through watching Ray I hit,
I laid her down, Beat it up,
Let her go clean it up,
Take a five minute nap wake up and eat it but,
Then there's part two in the sauna,
Feel like I'm fuckin' Mary J. 'cause she don't want no drama,
I'd rather take your ass to the Bahamas
And give you 30,000 and month like Diddy baby mama
I know you're sick and tired of waiting on me girl

Picture me thuggin',
Picture me loving you like Bobby love Whitney,
Now picture me fuckin',
Pullin' your ponytail,
Smackin' you on the ass,
Tellin' you how I can take you all around the world,
That nigga can't do it like this,
Even Beyonce couldn't move it like this,
She only fuck with soldiers,
That's her shit, I hate to admit it
But I love my bitch so much,
I'm sittin' outside in the Benz,
Thinking back to Dre's house when I fucked her best friend,
The pussy wasn't nothing,
Now I'm dealin' with the diary of a mad black woman with Louis Vuitton luggage,
She told me she was tired of The Game and rap,
Quit like Mase then she came right back,
I told you the bitch sex was whack,
And you're all I need,
Even Jamie know that
I know you're sick and tired of waiting on me girl
But I'm just trying to get my money right,
Soon as I'm done we can take a flight
So I can take you all around the world.
Planes, Trains, Automobiles, Bentley or a Range,
Chromed out wheels, First class ticket, G-4 you the deal,
For real, I can take you all around the world.
You know what they say,
More money, More problems, More drama,
Means more marijuana and less baby mama,
You know I love you like I love my shoes,
But even white Air Force Ones come in twos,
Yeah I like her and I like you too,
What's wrong, She my bitch and you my boo,
She got a Range Rover sport,
You got a Bentley coupe,
She take my clothes to the cleaners,
You take Harlem to school,
I gave her your birthday bag so I made a mistake,
And Oprah don't fuck with that no more anyway,
I'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through,
But I ain't going nowhere, I got a kid with you,
Why we always got to argue about Super Head's book,
She suck my dick with a condom on after that I shook,
And when she start talkin' about buying a ring,
I just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing
I know you're sick and tired of waiting on me girl
But I'm just trying to get my money right,
Soon as I'm done we can take a flight
So I can take you all around the world.
Planes, Trains, Automobiles, Bentley or a Range,

11,Ashes to Ashes,2011,Purp & Patron (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"(Verse 1: Rick Ross)
I got a house on my face, custom made glasses
Laser on heckler, ashes to ashes, valet to vessel
Known as an Aston, the Hoes give you ass, homie, only in my absence
Well connected with gang member on most sets
Not to boast but get you popped like moet
My record sales could never reflect my respect
What god damn Def Jam forever in debt
Money bags back and forth how carry it on
Tattoo dead homies on my arms, still I grieve for 'em
As I'm nailed to the crucifix, tears in my eyes, smiling on the inside (Blessed)
Nobody cares what I feel like, no
Now it's six xanax just to feel right, let's go
Periognom in my glasses, toast to competition
Ashed to ashes
(Hook: Game)
See the fireworks in the club, you know we got bottles
See the lambos out front, that tells you we fuckin' models
Spit real nigga shit, so you can bump it in the phantom
Make it rain for them niggas who ain't never seen Atlanta
Red diamonds in the watch, red frames in the lenses
How you know you on?, Baby mama driving Benzes
Louis Vuiton house shoes, somewhere on the boat
Like a snitch nigga body, let this motherfucker float
(Verse 2: Game)
Champagne in my glass feeling like a boss
Fell in love with a phantom, like fuck what it cost
Louis duffle full of hundreds, dimes of the purple, keep it G, cause that's me
These rap niggas Steve Urkel, survival of the fittest
Swimming in the dark, Sea World in my living room, Come and feed the sharks
Put on for my city, Or it would have fell apart, Nigga rap is like New York
Ain't no where to park
That's why I got a chauffeur, I don't need a valet, At the game, watchin' 'Bron give it up to Khaled
Not a hatin' bone in my body, nigga I salute 'cha
You disrespect my hood, I'll fuck around and shoot y 'cha
We got the world runnin' 'round throwin' up B's
Niggas saying ""so woo"" like they're fucking Chinese
Eyes tighter than a virgin when I'm blowing on these grapes, top down blowin' smoke on the fuckin' interstate

12,Bad Intentions,2011,Purp & Patron (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"Bad intentions nigga
Fucking with the wrong one
Call Dre tell that nigga I'm on one
Aftermath nigga we blaze cuban cigars
Drive foreign cars into the stars
Fuck bitches at our leisure
Stuff dick inside they throat till they have seizures
Hoes down, B's up
Roll the trees up, Smokey Robinson
Start trippin', I like his jewelry, then I'm robbin son
Fuck a platinum plaque nigga hood with it
Bouncin' that impala down the shore like what's good with it?
I'm a made man, I wear J's and
I been around more rocks than a fuckin' cave man
I done sold it and bagged it
I done drove it and crashed it
Fucked my credit up smashin the Ashton
FYI nigga I got a magnum,
Only time I been punked was by Ashton Kutcher
I'm a motherfuckin butcher
Leave me around anything white and I'm a cook it
I be all up in the kitchin
No need for an apron, playboy
I'm a professional, I'm cakin playboy
The last real D-boy up in this rap shit
Chrome 24s with the fat lip, call the shits? cash
? Fuckin' with the bomb squad
Dismantle any MC for free, you been warned god
Church, Higher power
Impala sittin' clean like it took 5 showers
Nigga I'm the G.A.M.E. so don't you tempt me
Your chest'll be full and my clip will be empty
I'm simply one of the most raw niggas in this shit
Why you think that I got in this shit?
Paid for my momma house, bout 700k
Can't stop smokin' but I'm down to a blunt a day
Yay, I mean yayo
On the block sun up sun down like where the day go?
We come through chargin nigga like San Diego
Seventeen chargers, couple of 'em same color but the shit is ok though
Cause all my niggas on the payroll get caught slippin, get a halo
And I ain't talking 'bout the x-box
Niggas let the tech knock
Welcome to the real life, black ops
Where it's still fuck the police, white and black cop
And we ain't killin' Jonny, no
Nigga give 'em an ass shot
Put him on injured reserve
Tie my number twelves up and then I give him the bird, word
That's how I get down, all you rap niggas floppin
Who talkin' shit now? only Drake and Yay worth coppin
I take a hiatus, spend a little time gamblin in Vegas
Come back to back runnin' faster than five Lakers
So mother fuck a hater and his family
About to finish the R.E.D. album up in Miami
Lebron can't stand me, 'cause I got this purp in my cup
24s on the truck, Laker game nigga what?
Ballin, Jim Jones voice probably with the Byrd Gang
See the chrome boy? and my mother fuckin' home boys
But I'm from Cali not to be confused with Khaled
He say that we the best but I'm the best that's valid
And before you try to say that that's a diss,
I was up at Khaled's house two days ago bitch
Sippin on a Long Island ice tea with a white bitch
That was just as bad as Ice-T's, but she's not the wifey
The wife be at home with the kid's
Look at them and see how a motherfucker live
24 cars, 5 and a half cribs, I was spending money like goin' broke was the shit, shit."

And all this money keep me in pussy, no cat
Stacks, but I got racks on racks on racks
Poof side at the W, take a puff and relax
This that millionaire lifestyle, audemar iced out
Order more spades then, hit her with that lifestyle
But these fake hoes won't leave me alone
Fake bag, fake ass, and she beggin' for patron
My credit making good, my credit need a loan
And them heels you got on, pound sign
Basic bitch
I gotta bitch with me, she gotta bitch with her
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no basic bitch
Beyoncé, laced front on
Who you trying to front on, and stunt on?
Basic bitch, she gotta fake Louie
Fake loobies, fake booty
So she a basic bitch
At the club all weekend, she trying to get rich
But all I got is this dick for a basic bitch
So knock it off with your knock-off
You give head, then a nigga ride with his top off
You the type I'd knock off, forget I ever met you
Block you on Twitter, never BBM or text you
Lookin' for the next you, I just wanted to sex you
Hit you on the D-Low, I'm Cee-Lo, F You
Cause every time I'm up in the club looking for hoes
Everything look good off a couple bottles of rose
Downloading your swag, Starting off with your toes
And paintin' a mental picture of you without all your clothes
Have you ever fucked a millionaire in the back of a Rolls rose?
With Amber Rose? I ain't talking 'bout no
I can tell by your avatar, you never had caviar
Your friends can't go, you can't go, you don't have a car
But that weave hanging down to your ass
Bitch ain't from Dallas, but she routing for the Mav's
You a bandwagon ho fo sho'
You up in every video takin' off your clothes

After the funeral she right back to the followers and filters
She got a Range and a Benz
Doin' credit card schemes with her ratchet ass friends

Puttin' this shit together, my nigga
It ain't a nigga in the game that could hold me down
I've been independent forever so they know me now
And I'm the cat they gotta find when they wanna get signed
You wanna get your paper right you gotta study my grind
I'm like Rush in ""Krush Groove,"" a nigga that bust moves
Right out, and tuck tools, bullets that bust dudes
Ain't no beef in the briefcase, just beef for Pete's sake
We round up cats, to beat 'em in a street race
We count paper up, to make a nigga change his plans
They under weight so they ain't gettin' off they gram
You mad at my boys, 'cause we choppin 'em in
They make twenty then the Fig want 10
That's the rules that the Get Low, play by
The block boys stay high, California stock with K-5
It's the rules that the Get Low play by
Them block boys stay high, the California K-5

Huh, it's the Blacksox doin' a joint together
The whole world stoppin' to listen, ol' breakers poplockin to this
And white boys headboppin in 6's, niggaz boxin in prison

Yo, yo, well it's the B dot L dot, you know the rest
Wanted by the feds, hated by the ATF
You can catch me at the DuPont Inn, two dykes swallowin gin
Shorty sucked me out of my Timbs
My bad, that's your wife? Fuck your life
Anyway I heard you workin for vice
You ain't real man you hide behind ice
Youse a impostor, snatch him off the roster
Always live by the rule, get dough, or die tryin'
Hardcoded into shinin
Pass the bucket now I'm back on bet it
If, beef was erased man my tool gon' finish
Never been the loudmouth type

Listen rookie, don't make me mad boy
Or you gon' be like Big, a dead (Bad Boy)

Huh, niggaz think they got the game sewed, yeah right
I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navi outside, I might be there
Black hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs
Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare
You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear
And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead
Then I'm goin' goin', back back
To the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns
'Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots
I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX
Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box
And when I die, bury me with the glock, and a bucket of shells
In case niggaz want drama in hell"

You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin' your fiends with me
My guns smoke like Robert Downey
Two shots and a pound he got a room in Kings County
And you might live or sit in a box
Depending on how long it NYPD to respond to the shot
(Chorus: The Game)
Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek
(Verse 2: The Game)
See what the problem is too much east coast dick lickin'
And everybody tryin' to do their best 2pac rendition
Listen they wonder how I live with 5 shots
Niggaz is hard to kill on my block
When you was in the streets comin' of age
I was in the streets pumpin the gauge
While you was rappin' I was makin' it happen
On the block with a k
While you was with the roc on the stage
I had rocks on the stage
On headliner for the front page we know that you front
You be on sunset doin' what? Gettin' your punk ass stunt
You gon respect us or that fo' rippin through the vests
And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message
Malik or M-E-M-P-H Bleek
Fuck around and be a B-I-T-C-H sleek
'Cause all that yappin dude will get guns clappin dude
And stop Memphis from rappin' dude, huh
(Chorus: The Game)
Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek
(Verse 3: The Game)
It took me a little while but I am now understandin
Jay fucked up in the first round when he picked olo with candy
Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me
The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans
Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch
Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris
Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef
Fans in the stand yellin' out fuck Memphis Bleek
You want beef I have your body parts all over New York
Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park
You can't even borrow from New York no more like john Storch
And I ain't talkin' to him I'm talkin' to Malik
And I got a pine box for a nigga like you
Streets is talkin' how many real niggaz like you
Hit LAX remember when you come to the coast
Niggaz don't play with they lives when it comes to the toast
(Chorus: The Game)
Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek... Memph Bleek"

Jacob sold me my first couple pieces
I was killing niggas who misunderstood what diseased is
Spent half a mill on a Ferrari, I coulda leased it
Driving Scott Storch's Bugatti 'fore they released it
Drop The Documentary, rockin' khakis with creases
Dope and hip hop, it resurfaced with some leeches
Ten times platinum, now I'm chillin' where the beach is
Time to show the world what a motherfuckin' beast is
Blanca, bullet proof cars in Sri Lanka
12 years old, on his shoulder, a rocket launcher
10 thousand miles away, there's an owner of a corner store
A white man walks in, spit shinin' his Audemar
While somewhere in Africa, Jo-Burg and Congo is goin' to war
Rebels enslavin' they own people, diggin' water or
Get murdered 'cause that choppa is a carnivore
He found one and stole it, now the village tryna find that boy

Diamonds, cotton, that belong to niggas though

And we need blunts, so we walk in that motherfucker
Money in the safe, so we in that motherfucker
But you can't forget the tape, tryna pin a motherfucker
DEA ain't got a case, I'mma win that mothercuker
And it ain't about the Chinese, dude, I eat Chinese food
Where you think Michael Jordan find these shoes
We robbin' each other for 'em, think I should hide these jewels
Run up on you in broad day with them Siamese 2's
But nah, Mandela did 28 straight
Without a fucking complaint, put a afro on a saint
Put a wig on a judge, put a nigga in some chains
Over change, kill him, lethal injection inside his veins

Brutus killed Caesar
And Judas killed Jesus
John Wilkes Boothe killed Lincoln
And you thought he freed slaves, what the fuck was you thinkin'
Nigga fuck Lincoln

Rolled against Obama now you divin' in the deep end
I'd rather take my chances at this water fountain drinkin'
Where the fuck is the loyalty, knock these niggas fuckin' teeth in
In the hood singin' like they Aubrey or The Weeknd
Pull that tile from under that door, and let it seep in
There's a lot of shit I Don't Like, so bring Chief Keef in

Aight
Now everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game
I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack {*whispered* - Compton}
Yeah that's the name of my hometown
I'm goin' down, in the town, where my name is all around
And niggaz just be hatin' and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doin' nuttin but claimin my city
See my lyrics are double or nothin' provin to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go
Not really into freestylin, or tryin' to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so
And that's how I'm livin', I do as I please B
A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets
And everybody knows that you gotta be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton
{*Quiet scratching: ""Born and raised in Compton""*}
(The Game)
Nowww Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill dog
Till I found out, the streets get real dog
'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die
'Cause they kicked in the door, and gave the young kid five
They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role
'Cause I lived through fo' five six holes
But I ain't goin' out like no faggot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down
So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker
Ass clucker now you're duckin cause you can't stop a Y.G.
Gangsta, 'cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Game is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin' no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest
A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin to impress
My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest
I'm comin' like this and I'm comin' directly
Cause niggaz gettin' all stirred up, I'm doin' damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone and niggaz can't win
'Cause I'm a gangsta from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N"
22,Born in the Trap,2011,The R.E.D. Album (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"I was born in the crosshairs without a pot to piss in
Where niggas get smoked over their Jordans and their Pippens
Welcome to California, nah, it ain't cold as New York
But life is a bitch out here: word to Too Short
Wack as a shooter so we called him Tony Kukoc
Gang banging had us addicted like it was Newports
Whoever thought that it would spread like petroleum
Now BP connect got us praying to them holy men
Just had a daughter, almost named her Katrina
If I raise her right, then maybe she can take over FEMA
Spike Lee in New Orleans shooting documentaries
And Game still in Cali eating off The Documentary
Take 'em to the symmetry I mean the cemetery
Where everybody boxed in: Refrigerator Perry
And every little fuck up, they blame it on Barack
'Cause he's just like T.I.: Born in the Trap
And every little fuck up, they blame it on Barack
'Cause he's just like Gucci: Born in the Trap
And every little fuck up, they blame it on Barack
'Cause he's just like Jeezy: Born in the Trap
And every little fuck up, my gun she go ""crack!""
'Cause I'm just like Outkast, born in the Trap
So what's going on with you faggots?
And what you gonna do when your swagger no longer matters?
And your bitch ain't the baddest 'cause she in her mid-40s
And your Phantom played out so you hating on the shorties
'Cause they running around like they was your age, when you was your age
Fucking bitches raw cause now the world ain't got no AIDS
Yeah, 2050 on these niggas
Golddiggers sucked you dry left hickeys on you niggas
I used to run around like you, run the town like you
Walk my red nose and clown like you
But it got old like Betty White
This rap shit real deep like Barry White
Reminiscing on the days I used to carry white
Walking though them Crip hoods in the Cherry Nikes
Now I live a married life, walking in the house, to them home-cooked meals
Joint American Express accounts and less dollar bills
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
Just like Goodie Mob, I was born in the Trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But just like Luda, I was born in the Trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But like Soulja Boy, I was born in the Trap
Broke ass niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
Take 'em to Shawty Lo, nigga, learn how to Trap
Shit deeper than The Roots band
15's drumming, ?uestlove in the coupe fam
Riding through Pittsburgh, Wiz got the Steelers
Born by the jungle so I came with gorillas
Since niggas dropping more dimes than we fuckin'
We out the hood, tryna get money like (?)
Splitting backwoods just to get our weed stuffed in
The crack we cookin, we don't need ovens
We need something to put in the mouth of our kids
Instead of copping chains, lets fly to Chile and dig
Go to Haiti and feed, to the Bahamas and breathe
On the way back, scoop my nigga Shyne from Belize, you know
Sometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven sent
Then I get a high, feel like it's irrelevant
So I'm about to pop the trunk like an elephant
And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president
I'm 'bout to pop the trunk like an elephant

28,Cali Sunshine,2008,LAX (2008),Hip Hop,The Game,"California sunshine, in the summer time (4x)
Last year, Jazze Phe got stuck up inside the grand lux,
Most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up,
Any rapper could touched, any bitch could get fucked,
Under the California sun, impalas and big trucks,
They say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap,
'Cause you're body might wash up by the courts at Venice Beach,
Ain't shit sweet but my Swisher, ain't shit buzzin but my liquor,
Cali chickens got to the 80's strip and come back a little thicker,
With more ass then Delicious, that's my Flavor of Love,
We make it rain like Rainman, when he play with the glove,
I'm the king to you pawn niggas, punisher, spawn, niggas,
Playin' in green, Paul Pierce to you Lebron niggas,
We them barbeque, front and back lawn niggas,
Summer Jam, throw your ass offstage Akon niggas,
We drink Kool Aid with the ice on your arm nigga,
Take that Champion hoody off in the California sunshine
I'm in my drop top Phantom, down Wilshire boulevard,
We can't find Biggies' killers so we gave Diddy a star,
And I'm by far, Hollywood boulevard,
But I'm from a boulevard that tought y'all to shoot out of moving cars,
Remember, New Jersey driver's like a East Coast menace,
And Belly was like the sequel without O-Dogg in it,
Give me a New York minute,
To show you Cali got more dead bodies then the Yankees got New York pennants,
'Cause we Dodgers and Impalas with the windows tinted,
I duck shots where Venus and Sarena used to play tennis,
And they never came back, like throwin' a boomerang flat,
See me, I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat,
It's like a scene from a movie, when the screen fade black,
Niggas roll up on you, Now you stuck in that Harold and Cane trap,
If you slippin in Hollywood, and you get your chain snatched,
I know some niggas that know some niggas, I'll get your chain back.
Niggas already know who had the marijuana first,
We birthed haze and sour diesel, I was there when the water burst,
Hell nah we don't surf, We half way go to church,
Tell you the truth, shiit, right now I'm in the fuckin' hearse,
And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse,
It'll be another ten years before you see an MC Ren here,
Where he been, I been there, that Lambo, I'm in there,
Hotter then the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there,
Top off the Murcialago like Victoria's Secret swim swear,
So listen, I'm so sincere, bout to work out like gym wear,
Murder MTV's top ten, and tat my face with 10 tears,
That's 10 funerals, 10 caskets,
10 3-piece Ralph Lauren suits, 10 motorbikes stopping traffic,
And 10 reasons why I got California hotter than acid,
Don't you ever, ever leave me out of the top 10 you fuckin' bastards

30,California Dream,2011,The R.E.D. Album (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"(Verse 1 - Game)
I'm at the house bout to roll this kush up
I can get a call at any minute, so I'm just doing push-ups
Waiting on what seems to be forever
I burned a hole in my Polo sweater 'cause I was nervous
That's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta
Cause this time I'm having a baby girl
So it's whatever, whenever... whatever
You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever
First thing I'mma tell her? Daddy's your umbrella
Get with a glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella
Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name!
Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game
Who gon be the Godfather? Swizz? Lil Wayne?
Y'all smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins
And I just got a text from your mama
Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my comma...
(Verse 2 - Game)
You walk through the door, she on the ground crying
She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here
I ain't cleaning that shit up!
I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator
She screaming, her left the car seat
But I'mma tell her later
Forget the car seat - man - I'm hella-faded
She like ""I know you ain't high!"" Man, I'm celebrating...
Now we in the car, she won't put on her seatbelt
Screaming at the top of her lungs: ""I need help!""
Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions
Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening
Imagine: she pulling on me ""stop I'm about to crash, shit!""
Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit
Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time
Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times
Now we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair
Butterflies still here - am I happy? Hell yeah!
(Verse 3 - Game)
I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost
Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours
Think: damn... one of the nurses stuck her head out
They gave her an epideral so I pulled the couch bed out
Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out
She grabbing on the rails, looking like she about to pass out
Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record
""Breathe! 1, 2, 3, 4 - one more - 1, 2, 3, 4""
Push! C'mon Tea, push! God damn it, just push!""
Nurse coaching her, doctor pulling on shoulders
Giving me the notion to cut the umbilical
She out, 8 pounds 4 ounces
Hold up: I'm about to make an announcement
See, every time a child is born somebody leave the world
So I thank the woman who gave her life for my baby girl"

Anticipating I'm feeling your body, hoping that you would just give me a chance
God damn babe, just hold your glass up for this toast
My cash up and your ass up, and I'm the ones tipping the most
Tonight, on the westside
And if you wanna roll, have the best night of your life, no lie, no lie
Me and you together girl I'm celebrating you tonight
Uh, yeah I'm blown no cigarillo, rello
Loving like Mello, get on my level 101 carats in my bezel
I'm on, like soon as the ice cream truck at the ghetto
Little knucklehead always in trouble soon as I ask shawty her number, fo sho
Yeah I get it, then I bone, then I hit it like bone bone
Now you fucking up my zone, my zone, my zone
Said she wait for daddy come home
Told me she ain't got nothing on
I'm talking no thong, th-thong, thooong
Yeah she throwing that dick back
Hard as a back, sit on my lap
Fucking with me, ain't nothing better than that
That's a fact, that's a fact
Don't act Hollywood 'cause I don't act
Bout my business but I don't slack
This my celebration rap, so

I pour up for Pimp C, light up for Soulja Slim
Straight out the gutter, with the rest of the bowling pins
Money for days, bitches go both ways
On the road to riches, bitch I got road rage
Got the kush in the swisher, got the pussy, the liquor
Got a silencer on the gun, take it off like a stripper
Yeah, wake up, wake up, I'm going at your face make up
These niggas need stitches 'cause they taking pay cuts
Man somebody tell them hoes it's a celebration
All my niggas got guns no registration
Now go an' light that weed up, I'm Trukfit tee'd up
Hoes down, B's up
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I'm floatin' I'm gone
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I'm floatin' I'm gone
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high

37,Childrens Story,2011,Purp & Patron (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"Uncle chucky
Will you read us a bedtime story please huh please
All right
You kids get to bed I'll get the story book
Heeeeereeeee weeee go
Slam the impala door and want do ya see
Some niggas hangin' on the fence lookin' at me
I had phat red laces in my addidas
Big chain around my neck like mardi grass
So I stepped up to them (?) far from here
One nigga lifts his shirt then yells out ""yeah""
So I turned around quickly and jumped in my car
I was about to hit the switch then I thought like ""nah""
So I reached under my seat, and I grabbed my shit
It was a chrome four five with the kung fu grip
Stuffed it inside my dickies as I jumped out the car
Kept my hand on the trigger as I walked to the star
One nigga walks in, then here comes two
""What did you do""
I shot!
Are you crazy fool?
One nigga hit the ground then the other two scrammed
Now the cops are outside
Well I'll be damned
It was 7: 15 on my rolex watch
And I can't do the time that my rolex got
And like the hands on the clock, I went this way, thatta way
Ran around the corner, and that's when I threw my gat away
And impala passes, it's my homeboy clyde
He gave me the hand signal, so I jumped in his ride
It was a clean six fo, orignal inside
With no key in the ignition
Whered you get this clyde?
Nevermind, I'm out, it's a stolen whip
And I'm already runnin' from the cops and shit
So I hopped out the car like the dukes of hazard
Then clyde yells out ""you stupid bastard""
So I'm runnin' though traffic and I almost get hit
I lost one of my shoes, it's my airforce, shit
I'm haulin down the street with one shoe on
Walked straight into some niggas with all blue on
I only ran 30 blocks, how I end up in long beach
Cause in California the gangs in arms reach
He seen my red strings so he punched and caught me
So I knocked his ass out and took his boy out his barklys
I ain't seen these since 92′
I'm feelin' like a bad boy without the shiny suit
Here the cops come, shit, so I hide behind a honda
(?)
In the car kissin' (?)
Little did he know he was suckin my dick
I start bangin' on the window, I don't mean to disturb
But chris can you drop me off downtown, on third
He said sure, waddup game hop in
He was bangin' slick rick then I got an idea
Before we get to third drop me off right here
So I can walk inside the mall and cop some new gear
As I walked into the store they could see I was in a rush
So they bought me some jeans, a t shirt and fresh chucks
Walked out the store, looked left, oh no
Ran back in the store, here comes the 5-0
So I ran real quick, made a move to the back
And knocked a cute bitch into a polo rack
Said sorry, jumped over her and fled to the back door
Then I kicked the shit open, you won't believe who I saw
It's chris in handcuffs, pointin at me
And the cops made him chase me before they let him free
One cop tried to grab me, and the other one missed
I got away with more time, and they both got pissed
Ran straight out the mall, spotted this blue coupe
'Dogg pound' on the plates, that's gotta be snoop
So I ran up the car and said yo snoop
The cops got me on the run need a ride (?)
Hell yeah bigg snoop, little homie hop in
He dropped me off in compton, that's when my story ends
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
This another story about the wrong path
I had a big day, so I reclined my seat
It was a 20 minute ride to the C.P.T
Walked straight up to my house, pulled out my key
It's my girl playin' (?)"

Good girls, they be in CHURCH!
Always wonder why my grandmother
Try to get me to go to CHURCH!
Please Lord forgive me, I'm bout to take niggas to CHURCH!

Is that a white bag in it?
Yeah? No? Hold up. Stop
You ain't bout that life (bout that life)
You ain't bout that life
You don't bounce that ass like, ""Oh Lord!""
Then climb back up the pole to meet Christ
Saturday night, she twerkin' it for a real nigga
These niggas hatin', I hate them niggas
Make me wanna bring back Tommy Hilfiger
I'm in love with' a stripper, Quotin' the nigga T-Pain
Said I love dem' strippers, word to my nigga 2 Chainz
Got a leather Ferrari, Eddie Murphy pants
Ya strippin? Gon' twerk it then, cause' after this...
(Bridge: Trey Songz (and Game))
I know this ain't the first night
Go on girl, just do your thang
Don't be actin' shy
Take a sip and just do it babe
Sittin' here all night (just do it for me)
Don't waste no time girl (just do it for me)
Girl I pray that, me and you lay down
Come on baby, lay down, go on, lay down
Sooner or later, sooner or later
The way you move that ass [?]
Go on, baby, lay down

(CHURCH!) Lord save me!
(CHURCH!) Poppin' bands for my baby
(Verse 2: Game)
I'm a crucify that pussy
I'm a nail it here, I'm a nail it there
I'm a mail it here, I'm a mail it there
Doin' all this sippin' Belvedere
Gotta sheriff here and a baliff here
All we missin' is a judge
One night with a random bitch, and she'll burn your ass like a rug
Real niggas gon' say that, real niggas don't play that
Real nigga'll take a basic bitch, then close the trunk of that Maybach
Open the trunk to that Maybach, roll the bitch in that water
Conscience start gettin' the best of you, gotta pull a ho outta that water
Try to make some sense of it, tell a ho she got baptized
Put a couple hundreds in her Trues, tell a ho to get her act right
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
Red bottoms will make her fuck. You broke niggas don't stand a chance
Church!
(Verse 3: King Chip)
King Chip, eastside Cleveland ghetto mogul
You say, ""Damn, you livin' like that?""
I say, ""Bitch, I told you.""
Sunday mornin, extra clean, get these bitches off of him
I'm a roll through your hood, and collect my offering
Seen her with a group of friends, damn she got the best butt
Then she turned around, lookin' like Morris Chestnut
Aww, hell no, God damn. What the fuck?
Even though shit a nigga still might fuck...
You can be my ""Plan C"", just in case my ""A"" and ""B"" can't cut
Guess what? A nigga so fresh to death, I'm decomposin'
I just copped a dope ass condo, just to keep some hoes in
What I'm gon' do with all these racks?
Damn, what she gonna do with all that ass?
That baby oil is Holy Water
Ever met a young nigga with too much cash?
Her baby daddy live by my words
Damn, she cold, she got them curves
Double parked outside of the club
Niggas like, ""Damn, nigga got some nerves""
Smokin' these L's in the pulpit
With OG Chuck in the cool bitch
Got ten thousand all in ones cause, damn, that ass is stupid (Haha!)"

Corn rolled by a L.A. bitch
And I can't forget
My niggas riding the train Yankee fitted
Thermals under that Pelle shit
I love New York but gangbanging that's L.A. shit
And I'm proud of it
Spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are you can turn it down fuck it
I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangsta, let the .40 cal blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot the more I suffer
'Cause we trapped inside a world where your forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doing life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Than break up the streets of Compton and spill my blood in the pavement
Believe me niggas keep sayin' they gon heat me up
Talking that shit like they goin' lay me down
And then I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

Where LA niggas train to kill
Chop you up hundred times worse than the Haitians will
For real naw Pharrell I need a track homie

While you sit here thinking in the back of your mind this is the shit yeah
I spit for you niggas doing 25 on they 5th year ready to throw a nigga off the 5th tier
Them white boys in the Abercrombie and Fitch gear
And every nigga who ever helped me get here
Believe me niggas keep sayin' they gon heat me up

Five Bricks, six bricks

Not rap money, but money been rap since '88
Look at the world we live in
Niggas steady hate, to the heckler at Koch
Leave him chopped up like freddy's face
Niggas catching feelings
'Cause I'm about millions
And outta all the newcomers out, my flow's the illest
You a close second nigga,
A banana to a guerilla
Put us in the same cage and I'ma have to peel 'em
The best of both worlds
Rapping and drug dealing
Run and tell the chief I came to burn down the village
The head honcho, staring out the third story window
Of my Beverly Hills condo
With two long ass heats
I call 'em Shaq and Alonzo
You niggas want me outta L.A.

You done bought me enough jewelry
Tired of your shit my nigga you hitting

Nigga you lying, who you trying to run that game on?
Who you think I am? I'm not one of these thots you met at Playhouse

I just rode by nigga, you wasn't at Dre house
Parked my shit at Ye house and hopped in the uber
Jayceon stop lying you fucking think I'm stupid
Nah look ain't nobody say that
You ain't complain when I bought that Maybach
Put you in Chanel, your friend Chanelle can't even say that
You wanted to see Rihanna I put you and your friends at the concert
Closet full of Giuseppes you came a long way from Converse
Took you out that Hon-cord, put you in that Tom Ford
All this arguing I ain't got no time for it
You call my phone like fifty times
Don't do no shit like that
I was just fucking them girls
I was gon' get right back
Spinning around, spinning around
Spinning around, spinning around
It's the same old, we be going through the same old
Spinning around, spinning around
Pulling them down, taking them down

What yo dumbass screwing the house for?
And what time you get home anyway?
Shit, about four
And that's what the fuck you sleeping on the couch for
I don't give a fuck, thug life I'm an outlaw
And the next bitch ain't nothing but a house call
Scrolling through my iPhone looking for my sidechick
This bitch always flipping pushing buttons like a sidekick
That's when I hop in my Jeep and pull it out the toxic
And while you gone, guess what?
I'll be bouncing on that sidedick, nigga
I guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you
I guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you
I guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you
Shit, they stop making them, they stop making them
Guess she thought they stopped making real bitches when they made you
Shit, there's a few in the room and a couple in the Wraith too
Now she's explaining to you
That she's the baddest bitch to ever grace to pair of shoes
And if you are unable to find better you lose
And all this loud chirping that you consider rude
But when food is on the table
We may be arguing like the Cain and we Abel
Then we have some makeup love and we get back stable
Have a little girl I cut the cord from her navel
I guess it's just the way it goes down
Love is like a merry go round
I guess it's just the way it goes down
Love is like a merry go round

Leather gloves with the tips to toss

Smash down at the V.I.P.
Street smarts is crucial for young niggaz in the CX-3
Drop Jag with the price to pay

Guns all over the club

We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq
And more guns than the Nickerson Projects
Niggaz don't want beef with me
'Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin' shit but the sheets is free
And ain't nuttin to shoot the club up
You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up

Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome
And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A.I. zone
And mob like Al Capone through N.W.A.'s home
Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up
In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena
Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers
We ball up subpeonas, take niggaz to the cleaners
And you know what I'm talkin' about if y'all seen where...

What more can I say, just kill 'em
Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood

I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good
The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin the hood
Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood
Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood
Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone
Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones
Some niggaz ball, some niggaz do what we do
And other niggaz sing for Cash Money like TQ

That's on the set, all my niggas on call
Don't pray for me, pray for them niggas
Menace to society, I'm like Lorenz nigga
I want the rims nigga, and your gold chain
Don't blame me, blame 80s and cocaine
I want the rims nigga, and your gold chain
Don't blame me, blame 80s and cocaine
Ay yo I wake up, put on chronic like bitches makeup
Kush like Nicki and Meek, it's hard to breakup
38 tucked, take a piss and eat my breakfast
Six bitches at my kitchen table ass naked
I got more bitches than Hugh Heff, nigga I'm reckless
Iced out Playboy pendant hanging from my necklace
Used to take a brick chop that bitch up in sections
Pack it in the car like its Mexican no flexin
It's that whip work, chop that, sell it out, we cop that
On Wimbleton and Brazil in my impala with the top back
Where my nigga Top at?
Remember them days before you and Rock brought Watts back?
We was in Stevenson Village in front your crib nigga
Leanin like a top hot, ordering Tommy burgers with everything
Cop back my Glock fat nina Ross Akon black
Bullets pop up out of nowhere like State Farm blat!"

Let it jump, Killa-for-ni-a is where I'm from,
3 wheelin' with the ass out, smoke chronic till I pass out,
All the way to my nigga Daz house,
He always gotta big bad bitch from Long Beach,
She a known freak and she gotta long reach,
She gon' touch it, suck it, fuck it, never back down,

That's what the fuck I call ""Gangsta rap"",
I was the Aftermath remedy till friends turn enemies,
Streets kept me laced like bloods dipped in hennesse,
You niggaz act like the Game can't roll 'em out,
One man show still sell a motherfucker out,
We know Dre still sell a motherfucker out,
'Cause everybody here from the (Streets of Compton),
We got crip niggaz, blood niggaz, assays, asians,
Red and blue laces, tattoos on faces,
I kept you niggaz waiting had to take you back to the basics,

Everytime your bitch hear my voice she masturbating,

For she end up like superhead, giving superhead,
Every nigga in the industry now fuck superhead,
And I might just fuck her too,
If I ever catch her sliding or riding through the (Streets of Compton),
Rolling down Green Leaf smoking on that green leaf,
With a Mac 10 like I was born on Queen's Street,
Murder MCs like I was born in Queen's Bridge,
That how I show you palm niggas where the King is,
And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock,
I'm in the Hall Of Fame next to Snoop, behind 'Pac,
I got the whole motherfucking world locked,

Everybody wanna know what the fuck is going on,
Am I signed to Aftermath? Interscope? What's up with Geffen?
I'ma just say it like this:
One day I walked in the motherfuckin' house,
And all my shit was gone."
46,Dead,2011,Purp & Patron (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"(Game 1st verse)
This for my nigga C-Murder, locked away
This for the nigga conscious that took Pac away
This For The Niggas screaming On Me But Not Today
This for the niggas thinking' I was all Dr. Dre
This For The Magasin Writers words with a Lot Say
Come To My Hood It enough Good We Cocking Spray
Keep It Gully Like we are For Rock AWAY
Trick Gangsta Rap Like A hood
Come through the hood with a model chick that I got from 'Ye
And Rose Phantom Limitage Just a Block A wAY
So Let the Beat Not While you bob your head,
I switch cars Jump in the C.L., Smoother than Pete Rock
Air Max 95, flow classic like reboc
Members O1 try Lay Me Down like Shirak
R.i.P To All Them Niggas And All My Niggas
Don't Don't End Up dead
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead
(Game 2nd Verse)
One thing about me,
Always keep it real with myself
Like Nas, I'm Ill Will with myself
And I can feel the pain of Ms. Wallace
I wish Chris was here, so he could see C.J. blow
Like the paint on this Impala
Tell Afeni to holla if she need another son that rap
Pac's revengeAnd I got a gun that clap like Dr. Dre snares
Blow chronic like Dr. Dre cares
I been there, done that Dr. Dre shares all his bitches and his liquor
He ain't call me for Detox, but that's my nigga
Remember Who Brought Em Back To Compton
Nd 23 year Old Me was a fuckin' Monsters
Still Niggas Say I Ain't Hood what Fuck They Taking Bout
Like I want Kiss My Son on the Head nd Chuck 'em out
What up 50? Let's talk it out/But until we talk it out
Don't Don't End Up dead
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead
(Game 3rd Verse)
I remember when my older brother wanted to be Rakim
Now I'm livin' his dream, cause somebody shot him
And left me like Eric B. without Rakim
Still paid them for like B.B.S stock Rims
Now I Got California locked In
Dip in this Beamer, Same model, different year they shot Pac in
So what's The Top 10 If You Dead
Who Drop This Lamborghini If I'm In the feds
To Times Feeling spelling my Nights Up In The Bed
But I'm From Compton so When I'm Out Its Infrared
Get My Son ready For School nd I kiss His Heads
So When You See My Face In The Mirror
If I End Up Dead Bed
Never War Bullet Proof Vest and No Got Bullet Proof Car
You Know Me Westside Triple O.G
And I'ma tell you like the homie Snoop Dogg told me
Don't Don't End Up dead

Tombstones in my wallet.
If you talkin' 'bout my profit,
All I see is dead people.

You starve so when my momma tryna make a couple dollars,
Any nigga with a problem, they be dyin' over dead people.
Muthafuckin' dead people.
This shit gets deep.
Don't fuck with me.
You end up six feet deep.
Listen to how I did it.
I crept up slow on Willow.
Thinkin' 'bout climbin' through the fuckin' window.
In the backseat, potato burners.
Ski mask, body bag, duct tape, and a pillow.
In the front solo.
Sittin' low with the lights out.
Feelin' like Manson on some Sonny Sam shit.
With a murder on my mind that my mind on the homicide,
And my watch said they outta time.
Somebody gotta die, bottom line.
Front page, column nine.
Headline: Another Columbine.
I plan and plot and strategized, and thought about it.
Loaded up everything in the closet.
My objective is to get bloody.
They can beg and plead, yell and scream.
Try to leave, get in cheese, pray to God on they knees, but I'm still gettin' fucking ugly.
I fuckin' love it.
Took this nigga by his throat and fuckin' cut it and thought nothin' of it.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Man, I feel like killin' me a mother fucka.)
Last night, I must've had a blast choppin up bodies.
Woke up bloody as fuck in the hospital lobby.
Body filled with adrenaline.
Not rememberin what I did to get all this blood on my fuckin' Timberlands.
Cop's sayin' I did what to him?
Showin me pictures of cut-up bitches, disfigured members with body parts missin'.
Listen, I ain't do shit, I don't know shit.
Man, I don't give a fuck about that bitch.
Fuck whatever she said, fuck whatever she saw, it wasn't me.
Oh no no, not me.
Listen to the alibi.
I was at the movies, that Avatar shit,
With them 3-D glasses on,
And that shit longer than mother fucka.
Look at my pocket, get the tickets though.
That's my alibi, bitch.
Now what up?
Fresh out the cuffs, now I'm back on the outside,
And headed west where Homicide reside.
That's my nigga.
He live on 1st and 48th right next to the white chalk in between the yellow tape,
Behind the black gate.
Rottwielers and pitbulls, surrounded by snakes, AK's and AR's.
Some niggas hard to play, some niggas play hard
But that house right there, don't go in they yard
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Man, I feel like killin' me a mother fucka.)
Beware of dark shit, shot 'em through the fence
Tough offensive line men couldn't stop the blitz.
Them niggas inside, a couple kittens
And this right here, good riddance.
Nigga fuck around, it's suicide for instance
Picture the mind of a bullet
Here I come I can smell the flesh aimin' for your head or neck.
Nigga, pray to God I won't hit your chest.
Now here I come straight outta drum, headed for your lungs.
You in my sight.
The last one didn't do it right,
And I'm waitin.
Just lookin' at you.
Thinkin' about it and gettin' tired of lookin' at you.
Hi, daddy, remember me?
Goodbye, daddy, this is what it gotta be.
You brought me in this world, now I'm takin' you out.
Now you open up your muthafuckin mouth.
Simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
Simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.

48,Death Row Chain,2016,Streets of Compton (2016),Hip Hop,The Game,"I was just a young nigga on the block
Just a young nigga on the block
Said I was just a young nigga on the block
Just another young nigga on the block
Suge signed Pac, it was good 'cause I fuck with Dre
Straight out of Compton was a product of N.W.A
But shit everything change when Ice Cube went solo
Riding shotgun in my brother Fase Lolo
On my way to school, having shoot outs with the cholos
If it wasn't them, we getting jacked by the popo
In the tenth grade smoking weed on the low though
My momma ain't know though back of the class
With a Source magazine just flipping through the photos
Fuck with Reasonable Doubt but not when Pac was on the road though
In 1995 I started to bang
And I would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
Even though he was born on the East, Pac was accepted here
Especially rocking that chain with that electric chair
I set back and watched him, threw up the West side
As Suge, Pac, Snoop and Dre hit the cover of the Vibe
'96, it was on
I took a Death Row sticker then slapped it on the chrome
Riding down Rosecrans with my hand on the toast
Stuck at a light, bumping ""2 of Amerikaz Most""
I used to spray it on a locker, a nigga run up
I yell, ""Death Row!"" and sock him and I kept a gun tucked
Selling weed with my nigga Sonic
All we used to listen to was Doggystyle, All Eyez on Me and The Chronic
Then a couple Long Beach niggas changed the game
Daz and Kurupt, nigga, fuck O-Dog and Caine
But when Dr. Dre left, shit wasn't the same
And I would've did anything for that nigga Death Row chain
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
Dre started Aftermath and found Em
Eazy-E died from AIDS but why him?
Snoop signed to P, Suge signed Left Eye
Death Row fell apart, what happened to the West side?
I used to smoke and just sit in the truck
I was forced to bang Biggie and Puff
I was mad at niggas, felt Death Row ain't give us enough
And for that we ain't giving a fuck
The whole coast split it up, now Dre in New York working with Nas
And Pac stomping niggas out inside the mirage
I saw it on the news and I knew it was on
They say the look on Pac face, nigga knew he was wrong
Knew he was gone, stomp the nigga two minutes long
Know I'm repping West side, putting you in the song, damn
2Pac got smoked by Baby Lane
And both of them niggas dead over a fucking Death Row chain
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains"

Where I'm picturing stones
I hit the switch, and watch them bitches be gone
Get it right figga, I'm in my rear view
Cause the streets can hear you
Bright moon to steer you, it's gotta be wild
Get in position cause the streets you'll find
Matter of fact I'm on a detail grind
Without no female lies, me and my team move
Ice like snow storms, the price gets
Tighter than vise grips, cause game is priceless
Jammed up with ice picks no way you can write this
Seven on the dices, the way that I like shit
Catch me in the background holding the mac now
You never back down bitch you better back down
Look in my eyes nigga tell me what you see
This right here, it's for the books like Frasier and Ali
Strap in ya belt 'cause we takin' the ride
Through this concrete jungle, where you scratch to survive
Ya gotta, play by the rules cause the wolves is lurkin
Night time the streets is quiet, but them wolves is workin
You can slip if you want, that's when ya know it's real
Back against the wall, that's when ya blow the steel
Hey yo I spit that crack, hit you with a freebie
After that, bet you keep coming back to see me
See me, now picture that
When I'm better than any other chick that rap
Y'all acting like I ain't never picked up the bat
Or picked up a mac, and make a bitch shit in her slacks
So try chill and relax, till I little spaz
I done filpped chicks for just trying to give me a dap
But since boy I take ya jewels, I ain't givin' 'em back
And they can investigate me I ain't givin' 'em jack
It's neither big I bang (?) for the streets strictly
That's why everywhere I go I got beef in the east with me
Give me ya leaf and the piece is sticky, don't try nothing tricky
I punch you in ya neck go tell ya moms to hit me
Custom made khaki's, no I'm not sticky
Who told y'all chicks you was fucking with me
Too many hutlers, and not enough customers
Shit on the hood, nobody gonna have no love for ya
Losing ya street cred on the real you can eat lead
And you don't want no problems, praying that the beef dead
Yo they brought me back to strangle the mood
The little and Slick Rick neck dangling gold
I ain't home but few times a day I be changing my clothes
I want this next generation to know
When rap suck, you brought it back to the essence
So sit back and really think before you ask any questions
Got this game in the cobra clutch cowards y'all know what's up
And ya shook what's on this earth I seen so much stuff
I used to roll with Russ, the doors opened up
Doing big big things like making clothes and stuff
Street master mind, y'all talking asinine
And I ain't have no choice my nigga I had to grind
I'm known for making moves, labels be baking fools
Everything is fixed, it's like people get paid to lose
A few occasions my neighbourhood do it major news
Ya boy got more flavor than Jamican food
Let's slow the process elimination
My niggas out for that mighty Dollar, What you chasing?
I done been where you trying to go and back again
I done seen niggas bang they own niggas
And believe me not an accident, so you think I give a fuck
What you say, how you feel
My niggas never tell shit, but a coward will
I used to yap about the Maybach
A real nigga in this industry is like a needle in the hay stack
Fresh deodors, what we got before us
Suckers think they flow sick mind is rigor mortis

Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut,

53,Dollar and a Dream,2015,The Documentary 2 (2015),Hip Hop,The Game,"They say it started in the East where the apple was
But out West we be throwing them apples up
They say them Fruit Town niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Tree Top niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Grape Street niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Bounty Hunter niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them 6-0 niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Cedar Block niggas gon' ride tonight
Them 1-9-0 niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Timberland niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Campanella niggas gon' ride tonight
Who gon' ride tonight, who gon' die tonight
Started with a dollar and a dream
Started with a dollar and a dream
We did it for the West, motherfucker, like Kanye
Niggas get stretched out on La Cienega
Got three thousand stacks, I ain't talking 'bout Andre
I put it on your head, I ain't talking no toupee
See I stayed the same, ain't go weird like Lupe
Squeeze on this trigger like ain't no more toothpaste
(You ain't gon' do shit) Bitch, of course I is
You want this money, you gon' have to drive the course I did
I got that Wraith out, you talking 'bout the Porsche out here
You in the nosebleeds, come down to where the courtside is
How a nigga with a rojo rag end up in Soho
Bag, any bitch walking with a solo swag
You think you ballin' in that four do' Jag? Nah
In Tom Fords with a MK bag? nah
Give you a bird's eye view of the streets
Nigga, welcome to Compton, take you to Carson next week
Ab-Soul!
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Look at me now, look at me now)
Started with a dollar and a dream!
I was fathered by the bastards
Pardon my mannerisms
The Curtiss magnet that managed without the metal with him
How the hell I did it? I let God ad lib it
I put that on Leetwood, I ain't lying one sentence
Bitch, I started with a dollar and a dream
We went from helping old ladies with their groceries at Alpha Beta
For a couple quarters to a baby hustling something major
We had to grow up sooner or later, but
I'm so Del Amo, my mama still stay off Anna Lee
Carson across my belly, I prove you lost already
Roccett my big brother, Bishop let the door crack
Game took me on my first tour, now look where we at
In the studio getting paid to reflect on that
Documenting true facts
Not to mention this the Documentary 2 too
You do the addition in ballerina shoes
Enough with the clever raps, it's more important than that
I put my city on the map, nigga
Yeah, I really put my city on the map
I mean, when the last time you heard Carson on the track, nigga?
Let alone when they calling out stomping grounds on the West
I'll wait
Yeah, that's what I thought, I'm the best, nigga
This the new West, nigga, respect that
It's Top Dawg, all I'm missing is the red hat
But don't question what pocket I had left, my handkerchief
I'm guilty by affiliation, in many ways gangsta
But let me explain something, a paradox if you may
I threw all on fresh Supreme Chuck Taylors today
And then I got a call from Chuck Taylor, I'm saying
The game ain't changed, we still changing the game
Soul!
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Look at me now, look at me now)
Started with a dollar and a dream!
My first album was a set up
I was the little nigga Pac was talking to
When he said ""keep your head up""
'Cause he knew what I would be facing after his demise
Jayceon had to pitch them pies, better life than flipping fries
I'm the one the Crips despise
Move the Yay or kiss the sky, for having dreams that 50 died
Eulogy by Mary Blige
Hopped up in that enterprise, had to stop a genocide
Went from underdog to watching Top Dawg and Kendrick rise
Now tell me can I testify, pull over trying to rest for 5
On a block, no tint on the Wraith left these kids mesmerized
They ask me how I did it, how I got it
Say I'm king you looking brolic
I put them weights down start practicing lyrical exercise
Tell me who the next to die, probably who the next in line
They got me battling ghost 'cause I'm the illest one alive
That's word to Pac, Pun, Biggie, why I stand as my city
It's wise to run a train, you couldn't fuck with me
Ever since I saved my coast, it's been born again
If I ain't shit then who the king of California then?
Who could out-rap me?
Now think about if the same nigga you bout to say can run up and out-strap me, yeah
Out-trap me, yeah, out-gat me
I mean think about it, exactly
Speaking matter-of-factly I'm down playing that actually
Call me Game I ain't one still I get paid like an athlete
Do the math after the math, Doc two in the bag
Lived up to expectations, Dre took me first in the draft
Now who the fuck want what
Nobody survives so look alive when them Impalas in the cut
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Look at me now, look at me now)
Started with a dollar and a dream!"

-- Don't cry (5X) don't...
(The Game)
Amayah wake up baby
I know you're sleepin', but daddy's home now
Pictures gettin' old, my lil' girl lookin' grown now
Your moms said you're talkin' on your own, walkin' on your own now
Run across the kitchen floor in them baby drawers
I sent you from off tour and I miss you when I was tourin
Smilin' at them baby pictures, so happy, tears pourin
God how can somethin' so beautiful come from me?
After the gunshots thought you was done with me
But I know I'm livin' now, why you made me put the guns down
Pick up the mic, start rappin' for a living now
My sun, my moon, my starts, my earth
My wind, my fire, my life, my bay-bay
Tryin' to make your moms life ya must be crazy, fussin and fightin
I know she love me cause ya look just like me
Day you came into this world I was so excited
Eleven twenty-one double-zero, my baby girl is here
(Blue Chip)
Yo, yo, you see this rap shit I do it for you
And the first time I heard your voice I prayed to God it had to be true
Got a son now, cuttin' the game, stoppin' the bullshit
Remember eyein your enemy, can you pull quick
Dipped out Cali, came back, snatched my son
My girl moms and I moved out Maui
Yeah your pops gone bananas, seen wild went hard
Bigger house, wider yard, nappy with the crash bar
Off that hersh', shit you stupid, you ain't no dad nigga
Takin' your black ass to court for all you have nigga
You see me and your moms, that's another topic
Ain't no whip in this world with a price you can't cop it
Stop it, press rewind, you didn't hear me right
It's a lesson to the song, I'm tryin' to steer you right
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home
Never sing that sad song, don't cry
(The Game)
Huh daddy ain't gon' preach to you, I'ma let your moms school you
Don't let the streets fool you, streets'll do you, that's why I'm talkin' to you
(Blue Chip)
Yeah, you see these niggaz out here, have you stressin by the hour
Never turn your back on your foes, them dudes cowards
(The Game)
Some days sweet, and some sour - but we gon' make it together
The world is ours, and you're my flower
(Blue Chip)
If it's ice you can get that, model chicks hit that
Never stress about the downfalls just 'bout the getback
(The Game)
And I ain't sayin' sex is wrong, just make sure he strap a condom on
And never, ever do it in your mother's home
(Blue Chip)
Yeah, never call a girl a bitch, show respect, son pop ya collar
Ain't nothin' free, scrape and lock every dollar
(The Game)
And I will leave you with this, my lil' angel, daddy loves you
How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you
(Blue Chip)
Yeah, switchin handles like you breakin a zone, candy paint Impala
On the Golden Bridge, bouncin' on chrome"
55,Don't Need Your Love,2005,The Documentary (2005),Hip Hop,The Game,"(The Game)
Yo Havoc, I'm too close to the edge on this one nigga
I ain't gon' jump though, I'ma keep it raw gutter
Yo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga
(The Game)
I got shit on my chest, I must confess
Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects
Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggaz
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin' I gotta teach my son
(Chorus: Faith Evans)
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change
(The Game)
I heard they got Bloods in New York now
Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no +Unsigned Hype+, nigga *FUCK* The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggaz breathin the same air as me, actin' like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'ma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is
(Chorus w/ variations + ad libs)
(The Game)
I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game set in stone, the Frank Muniz set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin' to be the king of the streets, niggaz'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nuttin between all my niggaz that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packin toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watchin my pivot
On my block in the Coupe readin kites from prison
I got niggaz doin' life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war
(Chorus - 2X w/ variations + ad libs)"

Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Nigga don't trip
Don't trip blood, I make it rain in Compton like it's a strip club
I grew up on Santana block, that's where the Crips was
My mama house was in the middle of the street
How was a nigga supposed to get to school
I hopped every backyard on my block
Till I got to Elm Street, took the rag out my sock
And I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much
All Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my Bulls jacket giving you the facts on Elm
King Frog and Big Face had my back on Elm
We was fighting over territory with the T-Flats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes
Air Max 95s not a scratch on my Nikes
2016 motherfucker don't you pull it
'Cause I made it out of Compton with a stab wound and five bullets
Don't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh
Don't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh
Don't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh

Nigga don't trip
'Cause I'm bool like that, I'm bool like that
I'm bool like that, yeah I'm bool like that
They say ""Game, why you always act a fool like that?""
'Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that
I was Blood and I ain't really like blue like that
They was Crippin they ain't give a fuck who like that
Them niggas jumped me why they have to do a 'ru like that
Nigga went and got the homies and we flew right back
They C like that, we B like that
We trip like that 'cause LA sick like that
We Blood like that, we Crip like that
The blunt lit like that, we out
When you ready, lemme know
When you want it, lemme know, I got it
When you see me, congratulate a nigga don't hate
Niggas will always be niggas, yep, true
That's why I don't trip on these niggas, would you?
Niggas is wild like gorillas that's stuck in that zoo, yep
What happens when niggas unite and start making the moves

Now his parents hustled
So he was left alone by himself a lot
So shit, he did whatever the fuck he wanted to do
When boys in the hood came out, this little nigga rolled himself a joint
And watched the whole motherfucker by itself
His pops didn't give a fuck, but his mom found out?
Shit, she'd kill him and his dad
She didn't want him seeing, being or getting caught up in no gangsta shit
So she never knew, until now"
60,Dr. Dre 2,2011,The R.E.D. Album (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"(Dr. Dre)
In Compton, you either a blood or a crip
Nigga ain't no one in between
Shit was a hard decision for him to make, cause both his parents was crips
His Uncle Greg was a crip, he died when he was 5
His brother Jevon was a Crip, he got murdered when he was just 13
After that he decided that being a crip just wasn't for him
So he ran across the tracks until everything turned red
And never looked back"

His moms and pops met in Compton
His pops was a Nutty Blocc Compton Crip
Moms was from South Central, she claimed Hoover
They had the lil nigga in 1979 at Martin Luther King hospital

Being born there is just like dying there"

This nigga been shot, but you already know that
He went to jail recently and Monster Kody taught him
""This ain't no place for you, you see bein' locked up 24 hours a day
That shit ain't gangsta, you see bein' outside takin' care of your family
That's the most gangsta shit a nigga could ever do""
He said ""The shit ideal for takin' 'em out the hood
Givin' 'em a chance to be some motherfuckin' body
Now that shit was gangsta"""

(Joell Ortiz)
Dollar icy from papi with the scraper Glock with the laser
Trying my best not to pop yet but the trop is major
Shot my lil 'cause I do my aunt the favor watch this
I never been this itchy hope these cops just
Get a doughnut urge and just splurge you bot he nerve to play third
In a softball tournament round my way say that's your word you bird
I'll put your beak on a curb but anyway
Looks like a good game the pigs ain't leaving so I'm a lay
Nice play just too bad it's your last
Couple bundles of D and 200 cash to sack you in the grass
So watch the teams line up shake hands guess the games over
Faggot nigga hopped in a Liberty fake Range Rover
I'm on his tail like Sonic little shorty palming on a 40
Broad day I'm trying to dodge a cover story
Look like he stopping for gass I'm a pluck him yay
This had to be his most unlucky lucky day
2 brothers come out of 7 Eleven in army wear and stand there
Acting like my tires need air
He closed the gas cap too many things going his way
So I just stashed that you probably think I'm bugging but hey
I know them games in Lindsay Park is every Sunday he ain't going nowhere
I went home switched gear went out and grabbed me a beer
10 drinks later I'm at Burger King window for a Whopper
Look left and see partner I hit the stash blokka
(Game)
Who the fuck you think you is Ron O'Neal?
Tat tat what the fuck when that 9 milli peel
Is it real realer than Pitssburgh steel
Yo Ghost pass the toast these niggas is daffodils
Got buck naked bitches counting half a mil gloves on
Fully dressed bitches watching them with they snubs on
While I'm in the kitchen pretending to be Raekwon
Watching Rachel Ray all day I get my cake on
Fiends love me like a Drake song
Rep that Louboutin bottom in my back pocket all day long
Black Wall Mafias Wu-Tang Sopranos
Niggas steady pushing keys but we don't see pianos
Niggas steady pushing Phantoms we don't see the opera
Niggas steady rocking dreads you ain't even Rasta
Take your New Era off and reveal
The faggot nigga you are or your cap getting peeled
Then we out to Brazil I know niggas in Negril
That'd chop your fucking head off and throw it on a grill
Take the gold out your mouth and throw it in they grill
Send a finger to your moms and let her know that it's real
Nigga we in the field like Chris Johnson
It's 2010 how the fuck we get 6 Thompsons
Top 10 how the fuck you gonna forget Compton
Every rapper on your list'll get their shit stomped in
I started soowoo I'm the reasaon for that 5 shit
Came in the game on that fucking Ready to Die shit
Sold 9 mil ended up with some fly shit
Naked pictures R&B bitches all in my Sidekick
How I be killin' the pussy should be a hate crime
Got a BlackBerry was getting too much FaceTime
Back to fucking project bitches now I hate dimes
All they want is money my nigga I can't waste mine
I son niggas like it's day time
Grey cotton Louis sweat suit with the Ralph Lauren waist lines
Smooth as a baby's ass and I got that Baby cash
Catch me in the hood same deals Old Navy had

64,Drame Is Real,2004,Untold Story (2004),Hip Hop,The Game,"(San Quinn)
Drama is real, like not wakin' up
I'm breakin up grounds when this patriot thrust
Your mouth is on shut, your emotions are hidden
For you to handle your business, you are more than driven
If you kill it no more standin on that corner like a stop sign
Everytime you spotted they call it shot time
Not at the gym but in the grim reaper's hands
You important if a bullet hits, injure your plans
This is not an adventure, but a full-time duty
If you seen how niggaz hit the club, they pullin out uzis
Sometimes bruisin and grazin, mostly takin'
No more sleep for the shooter, no more of that hangin'
No mo' trustin hoes you ain't know fo' ten plus
No mo' smokin' with the homies, no mo' late night clubs
Cause the victim, is ready to stick him like a mousetrap
I'm 'bout to rap, you better be 'bout peepin out cash
(Chorus: The Game)
If there's blood on my Nikes I done murdered a nigga
If the stash spot smokin' I done murdered a nigga
San Quinn got a hurt for the nigga, it get worser for niggaz
We take this beef shit further than niggaz
Streets are shady, the Game got curtains for niggaz
All-of-a-sudden-ass killers never heard of these niggaz
Have your whole family cryin a river, we'll murder you niggaz
We take this beef shit personal nigga
(The Game)
I ain't met a nigga yet could fuck with this rap vet
I'm the realest since I came in the game on Kam back
Rest in peace to Mausberg, gotta live with that
Keep the M2 on my hip, I live with that
Eat with that, sleep with that, come get me
Four-fifty put somethin' through your son Easter basket
Six in your truck, get you each a casket
Put termites in your box let 'em eat your cabbage
A wife right here, see if she can weave through traffic
Everybody gotta die, when the beef is active
If you know Game, you know I'll never give free passes
But I give choices, how you want it, metal or plastic
Life is real, pedal to traffic, no spots on my tail
Cops on the payroll so me and Quinn live well
And I can still get a nigga the hill, your bitch as well
Shotgun got mo' punks than shells
(The Game)
See the Escalade got 'em runnin' downhill, snowball niggaz
We throw vapors out of truck windows, blow our figures
Suede corners out the sunroof, the fifth or the Ruger
Broad daylight, blow the windows out of your Cougar
Move in the S5, plus my, leather dust fly
Spark up a dutch, Game put niggaz in a coffin too much
Turn niggaz kids into orphans too much, In God We Trust - nah
Keep the fifth close like Starsky and Hutch
Your daughter cryin it's just {?} tuck, but so what
Blow the dutch, southpaw bust out your whole fronts
Have you eatin soup for months, broken jaw, lick your shit out of straws
I guess I got that same ol' harm
I ain't for play, the Game is raw
Specialize in death jackets, here try these bullets on
And next time have all my cheese 'cause if you owe me
Guns O-U-T, we all gon' squeeze"

I woke up out that coma, 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents, ""Nigga With a Attitude, Volume 1""
Rap critics politicin
Wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G-Series and All Eyez On Me
I watched the death of a dynasty
So I told Vibe Magazine
Workin with Dr.Dre was a 
I had visions of makin a classic
Then my world turned black, like I was starin outta Stevie Wonder's glasses
Its kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Comin back from his fatal accident, to beat makin and rappin, but
We da future
Whitney Houston told me that, 'it's gon take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back'
Blushin in this 40 ounce
Lettin the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a 
Aaliyah had a 
Left Eye had a
So I reached out to Kanye and
(I brought you all my dreams, 'cause I love you, I love you, I love you, I)
I had dreams of fuckin an R'n'B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine
She loved gangstas, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house havin nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50' fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like, Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of bein Unsigned Hype
Till I was crushed my Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Day dreamin yesterday
Dozin off back-stage
I thought I saw Eazy talkin to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over heard Jam Master say
It's a hard-knock life, then you pass away
They say sleep is the cousin of death
Sow my eyes wide open 'cause a dream is kin to your last breath
Blushin in this 40 ounce
Lettin the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a 
Aaliyah had a 
Left Eye had a
So I reached out to Kanye and
(I brought you all my dreams, 'cause I love you, I love you, I love you, I)
The Dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin through
The Dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit?
Compton had Jheri Curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lim my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo-Kid, then I started blazin Clue
It was all a dream like B.I.G said it be
Don't sleep on me homie I bring nightmares to reality
Rap Phenomenon defyin the rules of gravity
Studied all the classic started revisin my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it
Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds wonderin where the hell Marvin Gaye went?
How do I say this?
I'm livin for my son
But I can't figure out why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus Piece like a Catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun
Blushin in this 40 ounce
Lettin the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a 
Aaliyah had a 
Left Eye had a
So I reached out to Kanye and
(I brought you all my dreams, 'cause I love you, I love you, I love you, I)

Fireworks when I spark
Yellow tape, lotta chalk
Thought you said you a boss, big deal
Bitch chill, pulling out that black card
Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill
I feel she might just get too faded, x-rated that's what I like
Glad that you made to this ceremony at hand
Take a sip, let's plan for the future
Introduce you to 
 get you right and...
May I kick a little something for G's
And make a few ends as I breeze through
The shit on my hip is a fucking preview
And guess what it lead to

Yeah I know I got 4 to go, so with these bars I flow
At a pace for the papes I thank y'all should know
I lace it properly for property, it really ain't no stoppin' me
And plus I'm tryin' to get my money on like Monopoly
Politickin economy, if I could be a made nigga
Smokin' on e'ry nigga, balled out paid nigga
Keepin' it real, I'm still deep in the field
Deep with the skills for the bills
I got the million dollar mouthpiece with no gold grill
I bring the thrill like Will Clark
I will bust I will spark and flame in the booth
You blind you shoulda saw it when I came in the booth
I serve the thunder, that shit that'll brang in the roof

Blow fast Swishers with my folks, act vicious with my folks

There's nothin' to a boss, man we live it up
Smash for the cash and respect so when we mash niggaz give it up
I got no time for that fake shit

You can't ball then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the desert, if you a gangster or not

And every nigga gon' cry when he hit
The more pain the more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggaz ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this
The Game the reason all these niggaz on that ""Cali Love"" shit
Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Pull it hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it

It's time for me to shine, life on the grind, life on the line
Feelin' like I'm runnin' out of time
It's now or never, chasin this cheddar till things get better
These streets got me hungry as ever
Can't stop can't change, young Sav stuck in the game
Everyday we gotta hustle and slang, struggle and strain
To bubble, weed plus the 'caine to juggle
Organize the brains and muscle

You {?} like Sammy did Gotti, told 'em we kamikaze
Like those whiteboys ain't heedin the robbery
Told 'em we ride around in them cars on them big wheels
In the killing field makin' 100 bills on the P-700 Pirelli wheels
Marshall Faulk in to ball again in this day to day scrimmage
'Bout the spinach this game is relentless where we livin'
Niggaz'll 32 round ya, kick you on the ground

Lights is flashing, cameras filming
Soon as we walked up in the building
Bopers fainting, haters kneeling
I smell like money, look like a trillionaire
And I really don't care how you feeling
Big-faced hundred dollar bills I'm peeling
Bottles stacked up to the ceiling
And I just can't explain the feeling
Fellas, put your grands up
Ladies, put your hands up
We sipping Jimmy Neutron, player, and I can barely stand up
R.I.P. to the Pimp, you know I rep for UGK
Get 4 million with Clinton Sparks, your favorite DJ

Any nigga want drama, boy, I hit 'em with the 'K
Nigga act cool, nigga, hit 'em with a J
Swim in that pool, Pat and Ryan all day
Nigga need work, I got birds in the safe
Ski mask in the cut hand, keys to the Maybach
Where you lay at, bitch, I scope I never miss where I spray at
Underground King, nigga, UGK that
You should try crack all night, all day that
Tell me where the weight at
ZipLock baggies all in the trunk
Going through the zone blowing that purple stunk
It's the critics, get it?
(?) Only got straight A's in physics
Dope boy business, Dope boy flashy
Chains on my neck, elbows still ashy
Hood nigga for real
Ask my nigga Pharrell
Turning my fingers on, the boy is the raw deal
Chicks all dimes, the motto is cash peels
Each one of them off down in Louis Vuitton heels
Tell 'em muthafuckas that the legend is real
Sleep next to a dime that I wake up to a meal
House on the hills
Where Hurricane lay his head at
Anywhere in the U.S., that's where I get my bread at
Nigga play the 9 by my waist, where the lead at?
Anywhere that I shoot, same spot nigga dig that?
Yellow take nigga
Clinton Sparks on the California quake nigga
When the light on, quick to kill a fake nigga
Cash Money in my pocket like the Drake nigga (nigga)
Lemme see you hit the floor (c'mon)

Charlie O, drop that hot shit
(The Game)
Motherfucker it's the Game, mister tint the windows wit'cha brain
Since a young'n up and comin', all I did was cop 'caine
They try and change the Game, nigga I still cop 'caine
I ain't moved out the hood, still stay where the cops came
Bitches tryin' to throw salt in my name, barbers tryin' to part my game
Niggaz tryin' to chalk my frame
But I walk on a thin line without scuffin my Chucks
Bad Boy, and I fuck with Puff
So bring the guns if you want nigga; I'm real good with the glock
And 50 G's say you leave in a box
When I fuck Lil' Kim guess I'm feelin' like 'Pac
Niggaz wanna wrestle The Game, guess they feel like The Rock
""It doesn't matter,"" 745 up and down your block
Hop out with a Nextel, niggaz feel like they shot
It's different in my hood, only time we take shots
Is when the Dodgers did good, my niggaz live on the block
This is for the gangster, in me
This is for the gangster, in you - all my gangsters pour the brew
This is for the gangster, in me
This is for the gangster, in you - all my gangsters red and blue
(Verse Two)
I'm worldwide with this gangsta lean, my life's no dream
I got a crew in Jamaica, Queens
Lake Charles up to New Orleans in D.C. I sip
My thugs get crunk off Lil' Flip
State to state many shows I rip, I'm the boss of the Bay
Like Clint Eastwood, make my day
Fine bitches look like Lisa Raye, plot on gettin' paid
In the end, all they get is played
Maybe a nut, no Ice Capade
Real dudes is shiesty, I only give jewels to wifey
And I don't give a fuck if you really don't like me
It's in my blood to thug, get ill and hyphy
One of the best I might be, it really don't matter
When I bust, sucker MC's scatter, gettin' out of my way
I bust bad bitches night and day
I make classics like Dr. Dre, closed casket from rhymes I say
(The Game)
... Gon' move in on your rock, say fuck the crisis
And ride with the West we got lower coat prices
You know me the king of L.A., New York
Drivin' through Brooklyn in a fo', same color as water
You want X? I can cover the order
Ninety-fo' been hustlin now watch the shit elevate like Vince Carter
Not the rap martyr, or the second rap Carter
Compton's own, I'm home, not the best I just rap harder
Heir to the throne, nobody rep Compton like me
Street spinnin like waves on that Continental T
My grandmoms woulda been proud of me, look at your grandson now
Till my demis, Black Mafia ties
So it's hard to let the larcent die, my {?} treys
A killer changin the game like them Marcy guys
And I been compared to Shyne like Shyne was compared to Biggie

I talked to all the homies
Yeah, all the homies
Swear today we wish we were with you
I remember when I first rolled up
Seen you laid out there on Rolls Cranz
It was Cedar Block and if you read about us
We was throwing that shit up with both hands
Make me wanna hop back in that old van
Take an old E and sip the whole can
But I'm out here with your brother and your pops
All night, my nigga, I ain't got no plans
Your mom's out here having a fit
Big frog and the truck niggas sick
All the homies no the block getting lit
Putting everything they can into a clip
Yeah, to the street, it wasn't even Crips
Just some homies trying to blame a bitch
'Cause he was riding on sky today
Wrong time, wrong place, fucked up shit
But your funeral ain't nothing but love
Look around, it ain't nothing but Bloods
And let me tell you what a bitch nigga did:
Took a daddy away from seven kids

Still riding around the city thinking about all the memories
Thinking back like God damn, all them niggas
Really really livin' me
Wishing I knew what I knew now
Half them niggas wouldn't have been next to me
Nowadays, ain't too many niggas next to me
None of these bitches getting next me
I seen what it did to a good friend
That was God trying to lecture me
That was God trying to open me
That's when God got close to me
I went through the fire, went through the pain
Now it's all hope for me
Now it's Designer, ain't no (?) they go show for me
My haters is mad, oh you know, they don't go for me
They wish I was gone, they wish in the song
Somebody wrote for me
But I got the gold in me
I got the truth in me

First time in Detroit, had to rock the Grant Hills
'Cause I threw up my dukes when California was at a stand still

Walk inside my closet like fuck everything red, dog

If I told you, I'd have me floating in cement shoes
See Compton ain't shit really
And I've been at the bottom of the pits, feel me?

Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot, had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac, I'm like birdie at the troops

Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest, it's kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one: the homies never came to see me
Suspect two: Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three: I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started 'cause we fought and he couldn't see me
There's usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night, I'm like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
I'm cool with taking mine, but I took other niggas' gunshots
Chest wide open, I'm tryna fight, but my lungs not
Hole in my chest 'bout the size of a Kumquat
I know who shot me 'cause I shot them
But who set me up? I ain't tripping but...

Now we like two red-nosed Pits
Cross him, you gotta cross me

Two door Mustang and the roof was missing
Every girl at ya school had the new extensions
Even gangstaz was dancin' like New Edition
'Cause the house parties stayed rockin' all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was all right

Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky 'cause The Game don't stop

Every rap metaphor always ends in my name:
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talking 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em

Young niggas with skinnies, moving with them semis
Catch your ass leaving the club, murk you at Denny's
Squeeze till it's empty, it seems so unreal
Till the gunfire got you using tables as a shield
East side, west side, niggas getting chastised
Dropping like fruit flies, we all know who die
We all go on Insta and get the whole rundown
A 15 second clip until he put the gun down
Know OG's who took more shots like diabetics
Had that MAC paint on your face like cosmetics
Chucking up big ass B's is my fetish
Type of shit that make you go brazy if I let it
Niggas got zippers, wheelchairs and prosthetics
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway
Hundred days, hundred nights, nigga
Let the K scream till we see the red and blue lights, nigga
From the Hoovers to the Hundreds, nigga
From Kelly Park to Bounty Hunters, nigga
(Watch out for the shooters)
Same age as the kids in Iraq now
LA Chiraq now, funerals is packed now
Preachers at the pulpit, Jesus is the background
Grandmother get shot walking out the church
How that sound?
Niggas don't really like it but we grew up in it
City of angels, belly of the beast get chewed up in it
Started as Black Panthers, everything power, everything pro black
Started off unified the FBI know that
A little coke sprinkled on tables but wasn't no crack
False imprisonment, Huey P, Geronimo Pratt
Now close your eyes, listen to me, your mind'll go back
Picture us chained together under the boat, that's a Kodak
And since today is Thursday, let me hit you with a throwback
Stolen identities, God left us here without lowjack
Forced to find ourselves, forced to break up outta chains
Got tired of getting hanged so we started our own gangs
Tookie Williams (Crip), Sylvester Scott (Blood)
Seventy two Lil' Country caught a slug
And that was the first time a crip ever killed a blood
Now the shit is worldwide cause it is what it was
We know the history and we know the shit could end any day
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Crips, primarily African American gang
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Founded in Los Angeles, California 1969
By Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams
Though we still gang bang anyway
Today there's over a million Crip members worldwide
Associated with the blue bandana
Bloods, also primarily African American
Street gang founded in Los Angeles county city known as Compton
By Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens
A mission he formed to provide members protection from the Crips
Today there's over 5 million Bloods worldwide
The government still can't contain us
And our fate was sealed forever
When 17 year old LA brim Frederick ""Lil Country"" Garrett
Was murdered by west side Crips on June fifth 1972
Hey man ain't that Lil Country over there 'cause?
If it is, his ass gon' be laying in a blood river
Hey man, make a u-turn and pull up on him real slow
All right 'cause
What's happening Fred?
Frederick, oh my god, oh my god Frederick no, no
Please, oh my God
Somebody help me
Y'all just gonna fucking stand there? Call the police
Somebody help me, please
Okay stay with me"

Take a breath, inhale, let it go, lights off
Have a problem, hit the switch, lay it low

If 22's on the truck, give me coochie yet
But I come through in the new GS with two, three tecs
Got niggaz Harlem Shakin like the new G. Dep

And every nigga gon' cry when he hit, the more pain
The more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggaz ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this
The Game the reason all these niggaz on that ""Cali Love"" shit
Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Comin' hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it

Pointin fingers at them niggaz, that kept shit hot

Learn about your whereabouts and we right there
Me and Game have you left right there

We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese
I got niggaz out in Compton that'll find yo' ass

For a long time if you ever fuckin' with mine
It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud

87,Good Girls Go Bad,2011,The R.E.D. Album (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"Since Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man
Respect women, I don't care if they a two or a ten
We don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There's missing women out there, we should focus on 'em
This song is dedicated to Natalie Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my chronic out and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya
You ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air
Cause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no (I, wont)
If you don't, you gon' really love us (I said I won't)
Please don't use us, don't
Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but mm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that can still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl
This song remind me of Kat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree in ten years
Who's paying for all that therapy? Mm, nigga not me
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
And most of the shit I say is true
When I'm done with bad bitches know I'm coming straight to you good girl
Don't make the good girls go bad
Don't make the good girls go bad (I won't)
You don't really love her (I said I won't)
Please don't do it
Drizzy, I'm sitting here watching Basketball Wives
Like, ""uh, these basketball wives?""
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick
Can't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date
I pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass ""get on!""
Disrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hate on girls, I just hit on girls
Like ""hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world""
Get busy girl, drink that Rose till you're dizzy girl
She walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?
He on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Don spray
That's your girl? Nigga gon' make her cry
Soon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like ""let's ride""
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon' really love us
Please don't use us, don't
Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And that's my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy
Surrounded by them diamonds, Imma cold mackin'
Nigga it's a cold climate, don't ask me where the crime went
Just tell me where them dimes went

I'm so glad we have a choir in here, to wake me up every time I get tired in here
And one thing's for sure, gotta praise the lord
'Cause when I went to undefeated, they still have my force
Fell to the floor like
Halle-motherfucking-lujah, all my real niggas I salute ya
All the bad bitches, I'ma run throguh ya
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn, damn
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn, damn
Heaven's prays, all I'm tryina do is, reach you, praise you
Heaven's prays, all I'm wanna do is, my lord"

You know me I turn them 40 bottles upside down
Like niggaz with dead homies till it's empty like my 4 pound.
Niggaz thinkin' I'm drunk
Reach 4 my N.W.A chain and get ur ass beat wit da pump.
Tell security it's Game plus 50
And he probably gets fucked up every night like Bobby did Whitney.
Fuck poppin' crystal
I got a bottle of henny
Me and my nine stay together like Hardaway and lil'Penny
I ain't here so you can ask about Em or Dre
I came to see some bitches shake their ass like Beyonc.
So let me be hov' 4 a minute
Get up in your hoe 4 a minute
And you could be my hoe 4 a minute.
Like I'm Diddy
Be J-Lo 4 a minute
From the windows to the wall gettin' low while I'm in it.
All I gotta do is hit 'em with a Jay-Z line
Like you deserve to be my sunshine.
(Chorus - J Love)
See her on the Floor
She's sexy
Tell her where the af-
Ter party is
But make sure that you see her friends before,
Before, before, mmmmmmmmh
I'll spend a hundred dollars take a bitch to the hyatt,
Then treat her like Busta like her ass on fire.
I'm a gangsta mah,
I wanna see you wiggle your butt cheeks both hands round your ankles mah.
All I wanna see is ass and titties.
Shake it like they do in magic city
With T.I. in that mothafucka,
I'm like fifty [?PI?] in'this motha fucka.
You the them gold D's on that Porsche Truck
I show you how gangstas fuck
My 45 to the back of your weak
Both of your arms in handcuffs
Take a bottle of Cisco to the head
See how you like getting fucked with a pistol to ya head.
Tell ya girls I fucked your brains out,
We can do a manage-a-trois, pull the whips and chains out
I tear that frame out
I ain't no stunt man
I pull that range out
""Bitch""

See her on the Floor
She's sexy

Ter party is
But make sure that you see her friends before,
Before, before, mmmmmmmmh

Pour it on your weave like that bitch in the g-thang video.
You look wet, let me help you out your Von Dutch's
Know you used to niggas spinning but tonight I'm fucking,
The truck stop, the rims spin, I know they hate me fuck em.
It's killa cally nigga haters come a dime a dozen
Load 'em shells then I get drunk pissy,
This bottle of Hennessy got me wanting to fuck Missy.
I'm a gangsta I can turn that bitch out,
Play with her pussy then drop extasy in her crystal,
60 seconds later I'm kicking that bitch out.
Then ride down the show with the 4-5th out
Stop at the store
That bitch emptied my Cris out
Give me 50 feet or I'll empty this clip out.
Niggas wanna know what this LA shit 'bout

Uh-huh
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)
From the beginning to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know ""What's Going On"" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?
I love you ma
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

Freak bitch named Jada love the LOX, I got her talkin' to Kiss
Got my hands behind my head, now she all in the splits
Dick must be good 'cause now she in Boston with bricks
Got a text on my iPhone, she caught with my shit
Off with a ten, she took it 'cause she's far from a snitch
Hold her mama and her daddy down, got a sister at Georgetown
Paying her tuition so she ain't gotta be strippin'
It's money so I ain't trippin', this bullshit get printed
Them banks get scoped out, black cars get rented
My Gucci suit tailored, my fade get tapered
You get sent to your maker, fuckin' around with my paper

I know a Farrakhan though, three-story condo
IPod shuffling between Common, Jay Electronica and Bono
Armado, the last words of Paul Castellano

Smokin' Cheeba, feeding divas McDonald's
All the way in Milano, ashin' out Cohibas
Fuckin' in that blue Aventador, the nose like Gonzo
Let a bitch get a breather, then she back hittin' high notes
Throwin' Louis luggage at dealerships, fuck a car note
15's in everything, beating like Harpo
Rolling purple like Harpo, bitches by the car load
They wana see Prince, I'm pulling strings like Carlos
Santana, now we in Magic, Atlanta
Wipin' Ciroc off my Loubi's with my Gucci bandana

Kanye with Kim now, I'm happy for that nigga
Disrespect him or his wifey, I'll slap you for that nigga
Grew up listenin' to Pac, now I'm rappin' for that nigga
My brother been dead 20 years, I'm trappin' for that nigga
God Flow like Pusha n'em, rose Phantom pushin' 'em
Splittin' Louisville Sluggers open, puttin' kush in 'em
Ain't forgot about the Twin Towers, I blame Bush for them
Obama can't speak on it 'cause the government's shushin' him
But that's my nigga though, still stackin' figures
So one day I'm top 5 and I can politic with Jigga though
I was just trying to Blueprint myself behind Jigga, though
And all them old disses, yo, bullshit, Thibodeau

I speed off doing 90 with Tha Carter blaring
Bust shots in the Cavalier like I ball with Baron
Yeah I Blake Griff niggas, make stiff niggas
Eminem wasn't Dr. Dre's only sick nigga
Insane in the membrane like Soul Assassins
12 gauge stop a nigga heart like a bowl of Aspirin
I hold automatics, let your man hold the casket
Murder game cold as Aspen, body found in the trash bin
First 48, they don't find me, case closed
Like a rehabilitation spot in Bobby Brown nose
Take 'em back to Boyz in da Hood when I pull the pump out
Something like C-Murder on Worldstar when I dump out

Ain't nothing changed but them bullets in my clip
I still pull it, still bully niggas on the strip
Beef, I cook it fully with the fifth
And I ain't got no pets, I put a bullet in ya bitch
A nigga with a gun in his hand who won't bust it?
Like a bitch with a dick in her hand who won't suck it
This is the art of war, you niggas just drawing
Anything I target on is dearly departed, gone
Drive by or walk up on --

Silencer on the Glock, infrared beam

100,Holy Water,2012,Jesus Piece (2012),Hip Hop,The Game,"My Phantom so mean
Like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean
Even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans
And fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water
Holy water
Back when Michael Jordan was raw
'92 was the year my city was city of God
Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms
Is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
Them Yeezy's drop got 'em, couldn't afford 'em you shot 'em
'Cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms
We don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it
Return it back to the store when you no longer want it
Sleep outside for days for a pair of J's
Then you sleep outside forever 'cause you got sprayed
If you gon' die for em, they better be some number 4's
Or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores
Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage
Definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public
Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged
Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me
Take a look at her posin' on my car 'cause
My Phantom so mean
Like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean
Even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans
And fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water
Holy water
Met a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian
Suck a dick like sucking dick is her life's mission
Trynna' save her ass like trynna' save a stripper
She fine as fuck, you trynna' fuck, that's the reason you tip her
And all I'm sayin' is a watch and a gold chain
Can't make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane
And she knows this, that's why her mouth wide
Openin' up her legs straight up like they suicide
I cross my heart and hope to die
If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide
Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive
Workin' 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes
And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin' pies
Switchin' lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin' her thighs while I drive
Reminiscin' on the days I was rollin' broke
Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost
Amen!
My Phantom so mean
Like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean
Even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans
And fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water

104,I Remember,2012,Jesus Piece (2012),Hip Hop,The Game,"(Hook: Game (Future))
It's been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope
But if you put a brick right in front of me, I remember
Makin' sure they in the triple beam, I remember
Blow the fully auto magazine, I remember
(I done fucked so many bitches that I can't remember names
But if you put that pussy right up in my face, I remember
Drop that pussy down on the floor, I remember
The way she coppin' down on the floor, I remember)
(Verse 1: Game)
Pop the pussy, don't play with it
I don't care if Kanye hit it, I don't care if Jay hit it
I'm a eat it up and I'm a lay with it
We shot a chopper at the gun range
Got stupid cars, got dumb change
Red bottoms, let the tongue hang
Got an off-white Porsche, cum stain
I'm whippin' work (I remember)
Roll up that purp (I remember)
Pour up that syrup (I don't remember)
(How Tunechi had that purple Slushy comin' out that blender)
Got a Keisha, got a Rhonda
Got a Nisha, got a Tanya
Met a Tishaun, met a Honda
And I eat her anaconda
Got condoms in that condo
Got kush breeded in Rondo
Still hit me up for that blow
You already know
(Verse 2: Young Jeezy)
Drop top 'Rari shit, I drove it like I stole it
The Lambo in the shop, told my bitch to Range Rove
Microwave broke, so a nigga had to stove it
Dropped it off to my Auntie, told her hold it
I'm posted right now, posted in this Gucci link
7 dead, 30 mill, wonder what Kool G think
Quaters not half O's (I remember)
Now it's the middle of June, and it's snowing like December
If it get into the 'sacs in your hood, I could mend ya'
Ya' nigga talkin' reckless on your song, I'll revenge ya'
Pull up to the club in a Phantom, I had a vision
Break 'em all down on the hammer, end of vision
(Verse 3: Future)
Pop that pussy up in that hydraulics (what's that)
6 4, throw that brick inside a pot and cook it, whip it good though
Baking soda inside of her bowl, hey yo, watch me blow
Promethazine mixed with a Sprite, poor it foo'
Been sippin' syrup all night, and I get higher than a plane
Yeah I remember your pussy girl, but I don't know your name
I got diamonds hanging off, they can talk of the insane
Ever since I gave her that molly, man that girl ain't been the same
Better pop pussy for a real nigga
That's on the way, I'm a deal with ya
I'm a real boss, that real sauce
Don't try me bitch, I will floss
That's real talk, my top off, I'm throw it off
Homo that green no play golf
I hustle take no days off

What? This nigga only sixteen
And I wanted to be, just like him, middle school fightin
Any nigga with a chip on his shoulder, whattup nigga?
You want beef with me? Now I let the heat speak for me
No more talkin', just outline chalkin
Nigga Witta Attitude from birth, ""100 Miles and Running""
Gunnin bustin' shots like fuck the cops
Notorious for burnin blocks, weavin in and out of traffic and chop
Game the young Robin Hood of the block
Steal from the rich, give to the poor, coward niggaz rock
Second comin' of this black Alfred Hitchcock
Kick in the door, wavin the four-four
Ten shots to your spleen, let them violins sing

Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game, young'uns runnin' with 'caine
Rain hits so we floodin the game
When you come to Compton respect the grounds, leave you shook man

Hey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice
Fuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure

Fast cars, money and muscle, the hustle I was brought up in the 80's
Gangbangin, dope traffic, shit get crazy
From where niggaz grow up hard like dicks raised
Them hustlin guns like Knicks players, we got mouths to feed
Till they put flowers on me, moms kiss my cold cheek
In that pine box, I'm buyin rocks, eyein cops
Fuck a cell block, the young kid makin' it happen
Who you think got them fiends runnin' back like Bo Jackson?
I'm a gangsta, what else could I say?
I'm ahead of myself like it's Y4K
2Pac, Scarface, N.W.A.
Taught me how to dodge them bullets, keep my wig in play
Keep fo' snug in the waist or pay a thousand to have 'em
Niggaz in the street move faster than, Michael Jackson's album
But the shit don't really matter to me, we get better G
Bet the four slow 'em down like PCP

Real gangsters never talk shit, handle they business
Fuck the dry snitchin and bitchin, niggaz die when them bullets fly
Who fuckin' with him, ha? Not a nigga alive
End up dead in that 5
He got no sympathy for them dead guys, friend or foe
Watch that chest cave in, what that vest savin'?
Make it sloppy for the autopsy, leave my enemies in a frenzy
On the frontlines holdin' a 9
Everyday a new chapter, my own niggaz plottin on me
Tryin' to hit me but they won't get me, feel the semi first
Fuckin' with my dough, is the worst way to go
Y'all know, niggaz cry when them bullets burn slow dummy
In and out of spots watchin my money
If one dollar come up missin' bodies start to come up missin'
No one too heavy for the Expedition, piss on your corpse

And just to get shit crackin', I drop the toaster
Grab the Louis go Sammy Sosa

With the fifty-two Pete Rose throwback
Haze in my eyes, listen to Bobby Womack
On the same corner where Eazy-E sold coke at
And dawg I'ma test your education
What do I mean when I say I move more birds than migration?
I'm the nigga that'll smoke the purple, get high as a kite
Down half the Goose then choke your workers
Don't make me put two in your shirt, dawg I put in the work

Don't depend on tomorrow you can get shot today
I'll spit acid on your turf and watch your block decay
Dawg I spit on your grave and fertilize you too

Somebody needs to push your infant rap back in the womb

It don't matter what season, it don't matter not a day
I move traffic through the city, plus I keep the right of way
I'm on point like Bibby, I'm the leader of the team mayne
Got the whole city amped just like a Lakers versus Kings game
Everybody's fired up, I drop major packages
I'm never doin' bids because my game is so immaculate
A bitch try to snitch, ""I Can't Deny It"" like Fabolous
Before the evidence gatherin, someone's in an ambulance
Now that'll learn you to keep your big mouth shut
Those with big mouths I got the perfect size nuts
Yeah I do my dirt, but I wash my hands thoroughly
Handle my business first so I can celebrate early
It's business before pleasure my business brings me pleasure
It feels good to be able to shine, in any type of weather
That's why I do what I gotta do so my money's lookin' tight

Red hot, red bottoms, spicy like she cajun
Red rims, red cuts lookin' like a st-a-ar
Tell a nigga ballin' by the emblem on his ca-a-ar
So fa-a-ar, so go-o-ood
This is what they call me in the ho-o-ood

I smoke with some motherfuckin' hoes
That girl so high, I'm bout to knock her down soon
I walk into my roo-oom where them plants grow
She can't believe her eyes, I'm K-I-N-G and I smoke
Just wake up everybody with the Mazi when we come
Windows up, and a cloud of smoke 'cause we're young
We only live once, so every chance I smoke tree
And nigga I'm the king, don't nobody smoke me
(Verse 3: Mistah F.A.B.)
King of the city and everybody knows
North, East, West, anywhere I go
Used to be the prince, now the king down East
And everybody talk about the things I did
Warriors, Raiders, yeah, you know that logo
Damn I got swag, all I wear is Polo
Play with your kids, don't play with the kid
If you play with the kid, get hit with the .44
Used to be loco
Don't throw for runnin' from the po po's

You should see me in my 64
When I make the bitch pop

So if get it popin roll it up and hop in
The Game shine: the opposite of stock rims
So when it's Game Time, bring that Maserati drop in
So I can shine, push the button, pull the top in
Drop the top, tell lil mama to drop in
I like my ice creams with toppings

Your feet are the wheels, your legs are hydraulics
Bounce that, dump that, show me that you got it

Keep on snappin your fingers I ain't goin' away
I don't regret what I spit 'cause I know what I say
And niggas keep talkin' about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holdin' the glock
No beam, no silencer, I know when to pop
Wait till Lil Jon come on and let off a shot

Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water

I crossover like Steph Curry, crossover like CP
But I will not crossover so niggas can buy the CD
This NWA ha, smokin' that Bombay, we stay high
Niggas is killin', we out the way ha
I think about the day I first met Dre
I got my Aftermath Chain, I iced out the A
I stayed on some gangsta shit but still bump that De La
Dippin' down Green Leaf, Cherry Six Tre
I felt like I ain't need your love, wrote the song ""Hittin' Switches"", then I recorded the shit with Faith
I did the BET Awards with Mary J
I stayed on top of California like the bay niggas
Just the other day I
Seen a Compton hat and it reminded me of Eazy
Just the other day I
Had a dream that I did some more G Shit with Nate Dogg
Shout-out to the Bay, bruh
'Cause my niggas drivin' down with Chronic to LA
Where that Alize now?
Case a nigga wanna trip, got the thing on my waist side
Shout to my niggas up in Wayside
Take these Amber Rose pictures, send up 'em the way
I love my niggas, especially in the pen
I hold you down if I never see you again
I put that on my kids
I sweat them blood tears
I trade places with you, and do some of your years
I confronted my fears
I roll up a fat one and disappear on the pier
I wish you niggas was here and
Just the other day I, was riding through the old hood
Feelin' like the old Suge, me and my city both good
I understand I've been misunderstood
Niggas hate me 'cause they wishin' they could
Kill me, put my face on obituaries when I was just in they hood
Keepin' they bitches in missionary positions now look
Don't ever ask me about Dre I, been 100 with my nigga since the day I, signed to the Math and
Just the other day I
Seen a Compton hat and it reminded me of Eazy

Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come out
Man we strugglin, it's hard sometimes, but
Tomorrow's better than yesterday, uh
(The Game)
I was, born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction, darker complexion
Made it hard to live; dad, how you fathered your kids?
Stranded on the highway of life, left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shhhh, I'm still here, my mother's cries
Nigga no father figures make harder niggaz
Through the years, went to war with niggaz from what I saw in the picture
Now your son is bigger, 13, but just like you
Moms said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me just like you
Gunnin for riches, runnin' hoppin project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin till my coffee diminish
Why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin, huh
(The Game)
Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before the game, everything came with pain
Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn
Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father, that have the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree
I can see him rollin' over in his coffin
I'm left with often, thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man you oughta, be dead in a grave
But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage
High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Woulda been dead in an hour
Heard you was scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker"

Peanut butter inside, and she's my Reeses pieces
She gotta be mine, I don't do leases
I wear that baby phat out, like one of Russell's nieces
And I'm talking about the oldest one
And if I had to choose between them, she the coldest one
One Gucci, one Louie, one christian laby
Baby, maybe I should, I should draw the line but she gon' trace me
Walk in Jimmy Choo's and she dance like Stacey
Fuck the window shop she wanna try that thing on
I was like (yup!) but I ain't Trey Songz, I write Dre songs
And I bang Drake songs, I run this town
What the fuck is they on?

She says she's in the fashion
So I told her to a imagine
Gucci, Louie, Mark Jacob bags and
She on the catwalk, Tyra Banks she passed them
Love True Religions but can't fit the ass in
A size two, so what we gon' do is take it the Beyoncé's stylist
And she be wylin
Sayin' that my rap be violent
I know how to keep that silent
Take her far, far from the hood, where ain't no sirens
Unless she listenin' to Howard Stern on Sirius
No, I mean Sirius, 'cause she's so serious
And I kills the cat, when the cat get curious
And you can take me as that, biohazarding

My crew's committed, you dudes gon' get it
Have a seat you through when I'm finished, my troopers is fitted
Got 'em posted out in Brooklyn, Hollis Queens to the Bridge
We in the studio the Figgaro done did it again
We got factors out in the ditch where they smackin a bitch
I got homies out in the Bronx where they bustin' at cops

A little too, known, to stand on the block
And a lil' too eager to sit in the spot
Mami, I'm from the Eastside, yup yes that side
Heads fly if I open ya chest that wide
Gimme a bad vibe end up on ya backside
Or you can get your back and side splatted in back of ya ride
And I can make it happen, if I don't make it rappin'
This lump of Satan I'm packin thrash 'em with a major passion

Step ya game up

Momma used to look at me funny; she could tell her baby boy changed
Must be out there gettin' some money
But it's a price for everything, you know how the game go
For them birds niggaz'll cock back the calico
Now you introduced to the beef, what'chu gon' do now?
Bitch up, skid in your crib, or pull them tools out?
A lot of niggaz is real, a lot of niggaz is fake
A lot of niggaz shake your hand and shake hands with Jake

Fuck what'chu heard, I startled your brain
I hit the spot like a {?} in ballers and jeans
On some eighty-eight shit, more ""Raw"" than Kane
It's not my fault she looked at me - you better talk to your dame
That's just, part of the game and you got served
Who got nerve cause Lethal hard like Tupac words
And, why y'all Chucks always actin' like tough guys
You must be trippin' or you slippin on mudslides
And in the hood you see it's different from one time
What's your bloodline, play the strip to the sunshine
And I don't even know why I'm wastin my breath
I oughta be like Makaveli and be fakin my death
I keep that good shit it's tastin so fresh

Brown paper baggin', baby mama naggin'
You're either skinny jeans, Gucci belt or straight saggin'
Pleasure and agony, black James Cagney
The wood is the wood, but the hood is like a cavity
So much tragedy, rarely see clarity
I'm like a heir-to-be, charity, sincerely
Los Angeles, scandalous, handle us how?
We the ones you get your swag from, write that down
Home of the green leaf, watch out now
High school lesson, y'all can drop out now
California highway, California my way
I do it that way, then roll a fat jay
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Cadillac car
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been cooling in LA
La-la-la-la-la-la
Baby when you coming to LA?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I got LA poppin', cars be hoppin'
No refreshing these hoes, they keep shoppin'
Sunset droppin', chicken heads flockin'
No recess, my flows, there's no stoppin'
DeLorean rollin', pockets stay swollen
Drive down the 10, East Los is where I'm goin'
Cholo swagger, que pasa wassup?
I'm rockin' it in LA
LA native, LA Raider, LA Rams, motherfuckin' traitors
LA Clippers, LA Lakers, trippin' off Kobe, you the motherfuckin' greatest
LA Dodgers, finger to the Padres
East Los niggas sayin' chinga tu madre
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my fancy car
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been coolin' in-

126,Last Time You Seen,2015,The Documentary 2.5 (2015),Hip Hop,The Game,"When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
I know who killed Pac, nigga
The police know who killed Pac, nigga
Suge Knight know who killed Pac, nigga
He died at the car wash, the world heard the shots, nigga
Then they killed Biggie, he just came through to visit
Rampart division, Pirus ain't had nothing to do with it
So many niggas in caskets, then turned ashes
Some get shot, some Hussein Fatal in car crashes
I think it's a conspiracy theory, Illuminati
How Pac died and two months later they killed Kadafi
Then they killed Buntry Al and Heron, they getting sloppy
LAPD, these niggas worse than the Nazis
And Pac was only 25, thuggin' as a youngin'
Sitting shotgun, I wonder if he seen them shots coming
Guess it don't matter, all the niggas buried, though
Wouldn't have never happened if Suge kept it real with Harry-O
The way I look at it is like this, even me man, coming up in that game, right. I came up in that game, man, and I was blind to a lot of things. And even though I came to jail for some bullshit, I believe that the karma had a lot to do with that. See that's what happened with Fat Boy when he disrespected me in the game. But I was a good dude in a lot of ways to a lot of people and so a lot of people that crossed me in different ways think they gon' have karma. So karma swings for me both ways, what you put out you get back. You put out good shit, you gon' get good shit; it may not always look like it because sometimes there be obstacles in the between. But I dun learned 'cause when I was on the street I used to go hard in the paint about different shit. What I learned over the years though is, man, sometimes you ain't gotta be the judge, the jury or the situation 'cause karma gonna handle its business 'cause it's fair
Late night down Sunset, liking the scene
On a tour bus in St. Paul, riding to win
Don't know how it begin, every day was a new
When he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth
And if crack had took a part of the homies family tree
The lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me
And him to know my life story and we not even meet
When we did, it was like we'd known each other for dealing
When the last time I seen him? He was playing his tape
That he would later title Makaveli the Great
Smile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas
Try to touch money, high on weed and liquor
Hoping God'll forgive us, we been stuck here in the Matrix
Dead before you dishonor a nigga when he face him
Whatever shit you dealing with, you get you two Glocks
I guarantee that pussy shit'll stop
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?

Gangsta rap is where I live just knock on the front door
Niggas stunt more than jackie chan what the fuck them faggots
Saying nothing when I walk in the club with the gat in hand
Take 'em back to '94 shooing out a astra van
Banging was the blueprint money was the master plan
Duffel bank full of grants and franklins
Ride niggas take they money shoot straight to the bank then
Head to the barbershop to get chopped up
Hearing war stories who dead and who locked up
Who snitching, who pitching and who knocked up
Fuck niggas in black wall street I trust
Black hoodies and black asics standing on the pavement
Hustlers don't sleep nigga we work the grave shift
Fuck that long money nigga get paid quick

Don't give me these mitches
Don't hate me just let me ride lord just give me light
I don't hate mob deep or m.o.b
That was a phase I was caught up in a beef like a rat in a maze
And my legacy will never be that of a hater
Lyrical rhyme slayer wack niggas say your prayers
It's the return of ghandi
Criminal mind is sitting behind me
Put it on my face to remind me
Of all the shit I been through my physical prints my pen too nice
My first album sent you life
I should of put down the mic when rakim left dre
No cleanup hitter so I was stranded on second base
I had to steal third motherfucker that's my word
There's some queens niggas tryna put me back on the curb
I was ultimate warrior to you bully ass niggas
I will come through the hood with the fully axe niggas
Like snoop or suge I'm in the coop I'm good
Motherfuckers make way

The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone,
The D's is chrome, the frame is black.

Till the motherfucker bounce and break,
And knock both of the screws out the licence plate.
Let the games begin,
These other rap niggas so far behind they can taste my rims,
Shit, let the chronic burn as the daytons spin.
It ain't been this much drama since I first heard Eminem,
In the club, poppin' X pills like M & Ms,
Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend.
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round,
And put that cheap-ass hypnotic down.

Roll up chronic and hash,

Somebody tell me where the drinks at,
Where the bitches at,
You fucking on the first night, meet me in the back.
I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks,
Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protégé of the D R E,
Take a picture with him, and you gotta fuck me,
Then you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve,
Got sumthin on my waist say you can't touch Eve,
That's - my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods,
I'm in the club on some gangsta shit.

Light another dub,
Bitches get scared when niggas start fighting in the club.

Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat.

I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre
You passed me the torch, I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray,
Ridin' three-wheel motion till the ass scrapes,
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race.
Now watch it bounce,
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down.

Tell 'em you came with me,

129,Letter to the King,2008,LAX (2008),Hip Hop,The Game,"Second floor of my hotel
I'm rollin' up bout' to blaze
It's on now
To this Frankie Beverly and Mase
As our days about to pass
And our days in the past
He said my mind free
So my mind free at last
So much that I don't even drink from a glass
I'd rather find the first fountain I can
And do it fast
Didn't understand the dream of a king
I do the math
Coincidentally on ya birthdays
I ditched the Class
Cause the younger me, dumber me
Was chasin the cash
Chasin the ass
Lowlife with his face in the grass
Ridin' home from school
In front of the bus
Not even thinkin' bout how
Rosa Parks done it for us
How she stayed behind bars
And she done it for us
And she stayed behind bars
Till she won it for us
Sometimes I wanna give up
Or at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes
And see Coretta Scott's face. (x2)
Word up Game
Standin at the Pu
Panoramic view of the seating
Greeting
I've been meanin'
To do me some letter readin
To the king, he forever breathin
Your message is never leavin'
Some of your homies, fonies
I shu said it when I seen em
Some sleezy bastards
Greedy pastors
Should never be allowed to be
In Ebanezer Baptist Church
In Atlanta
So people be patient
I know there's ghetto grammar
But I'm a street dude
Normally I just speak rude
Martin Luther
The model of truth
But hate killed em
Nobel peace prize winner
They duplicate the feelin'
As a kid, I ain't relate really
I sell your dream speak jokely
Till your world awoken me
First I thought you was passive
Soft one to ass kiss
I was young
But honest, I was feelin' Muhammed
I ain't even know the strip
You had to have the march
You were more than talk
The first real Bravehart
We miss you.
The word NIGGER
Is nothin' like nigga
Don't sound shit like
Like game like Jigga
One came before the other
Like aim and pull the trigga
Wanna slang for my brotha
Wanna hang and take his picture
The rope ain't tight enough
He still alive, go fix it
Pour some gasoline on em
Call his daughters Black Bitches
Make 'em pick cotton
While his momma cleanin up the kitchen
Same cotton in white tees
That's the cotton they was pickin'
If Dr. King marched today would Bill Gates march?
I know Obama would
But would Hillary take part?
Great minds think great thoughts
The pictures I paint
Make the Mona Lisa look like fake art
I feel the pain of Nelson Mandella
Because when it rains, it pours
I need Rihanna's umbrella
For Coretta Scott's tear drops
When she got the phone call that
The future just took a fuckin' headshot
I wonder why Jesse Jackson didn't catch em
Before his body drop
Would he give me the answer
Probly Not.
Cut to DMX."

Fuck outta here, with all that lean and popping pills shit
Jump in my Impala get it hopping with a kill switch
I done been around the world, my life is like a field trip
I done been to Africa, seen niggas in Attica
Cops killing our youth, these numbers ain't adding up
Like that white boy sitting in a prison cell
Killed 9 people in a church, how he living still?
I couldn't understand, I spent hours
With Farrakhan, just begging him to let me be the millionth man
But some of these niggas just make you wanna kill a man
And let the .38 spin like a ceiling fan
Separate your body from soul, soul from Earth
Roll a blunt with your remains and then ash it in the dirt
Listen, you ain't a Christian cause you go to church
Listen, you ain't a gangster cause you got the work
A real gangster's one who take care of his whole family

One day we all die, baby
So I'd rather go hard, keep Cali alive, baby
Yeah, keep Cali alive, baby
Double entendre, nigga that's my baby
And don't nobody father kids like me
Word to Kevin Hart, take care of they rib like me
I made fucked up decisions but don't let 'em crucify me
I'm still the same nigga on my California ID
Yeah, Compton nigga
Blame Dre, it's his fault that I'm a monster, nigga
I was selling crack in west side Bompton, nigga

June 30th, 11:07 I got that call
She 8 centimeters, my lil' man about to fall
Scuffing my Air Forces, running through the hospital hall
Deja vu, like I been here before
I'm feeling reborn, like a Bed-Stuy brethren, my first born
Dre, I'm about to have a bad boy, family in the lobby
See my nigga Church, ""What Up,"" shit I left the camcorder in the truck
Running through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweating
I swear to God every minute's starting to feel like a second
I seen Hell staring down the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to Heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a little hash in it
Spread my wings, If only I could fly
Why fight to live homie?, If we only living to die
(Chorus: Busta Rhymes)
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me

My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

They say every time somebody die a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son

I'm panicking, nurse yelling for the doctor to come
All I could remember was lamaze class, breathe baby
""One (one), two (two), three (three), four (four),"" I see the head
Doc busting through the door, he between the legs
He see the head, it's my baby boy
11:46, the head out, she screaming, making crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach folding like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feeling like Mariah Carey, all these butterfly's
Voices singing to me, sound like Teena Marie
I'm calling niggas on tour, ""Jayo tell Spiz I just cut the umbilical cord""
11:57, a soldier is born, and he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Karan

I wanna thank Dr. Af and Nurse Theresa, for bringing my baby boy to life
You birthed a Caesar, And my baby Mama, Aliska
For pushing out a 10-pound, 4-ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose, ears, eyes, chin, just like your Daddy
I die before you grow up and be just like your Daddy, or your Grandfather
Call Uncle Zip, tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm popping Cris with your Godfathers, Baron Davis and ""D-Mack"" Darius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71, with my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Aaron Wright, T'Yan and Lil' Pun
Lowriding, banging ""Ready to Die,"" track number 1
If I bust 5 times and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun, one

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son

Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you
I wanna thank my baby mamas Tiff and Eliska for everything
Y'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring
It ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you
Wasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you
And I know you remember that time when he was 5
All these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes
So I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about
Nothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate
Catching up with my son, 'cause ain't nothing more important
Than walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans
Helping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9
I asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time
So we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married
He still my best man, and that's forever
Anybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave
But I'm a father, and I'ma be everything he need and more
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you
Every time I get in this booth
I'm reminded ten years ago I did it for you
Had this vision for you, and I know your daddy get in trouble sometimes
But I'ma stay up out this prison for you, I mean
You all my seed, lil' brother and both of your sisters
You all I need like Method and MJB
And I know I be wildin' sometimes, you told me (""Breathe daddy"") (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4)
Furthermore, I'm try'na stay outta trouble just for my sons
Even though it feel weird leaving my house without a gun
I just gotta do it, 'cause they might grow up and do this shit
Just 'cause they father do it, fuck with my kids and six Bloods
Jumping out a Buick, understand Puff choking that man for Jus
I'ma do my stuff even if I land in fucking cuffs
For every nigga out here without a kid
Have one and that's gon' be the best shit you ever did
One
I'm Harlem, The Game's oldest son
I make straight A's and I'm a good kid
But more importantly, I'm safe
Because my daddy hustled his way out of Compton
So I could have a better life
That's my daddy
And I wish all kids had one like mine
The world would be a better place
One

Walk back to my room, wake up this bitch
Kickin' her out, dick in her mouth, that Compton shit, boi

Putting five to them planes, that La Bamba shit

I got my ear to the ground, lil' nigga, I'm in these streets like
Streetlights and lead pipes, up in the projects

I'm cold like one below in Green Bay
Had the water on the block, to the fiends I was a stingray
I had a Z before I seen Jay
I had the West, I used to sling yay
But sometimes when tables turn like a DJ
Had them rocks and them bands like Green Day
I used to listen to, project pepto straps and sell crack
Used to smoke that Bobby Brown, fuck rats and sit back
On my forte, was more yay, my enemies got gift-wrapped
The two nicks in two days
Got new fits and new Js
Thankful for my two Ks
My vision clear as Blu-ray
Kill your ass today
Knock the glue off your toupée
My guns like ""hi"", leave that shy shit to Lupe

Still dippin in 64's, still puffin on the same chronic
Haters mad 'cause I still got it
I never fall off even without the Doc
You niggas sellin your soul tryin' to stay on top
Bitch nigga, check your Kotex

I'm the most anticipated, most celebrated,
Most loved, and the mothafuckin most hated,

You gotta deal with me, I'm the west coast savior

What do you call a nigga who's overbearing, belligerent, foul, defiant and very disrespectful?
You call that nigga the +Doctor's Advocate+
He's a reflection of Dr. Dre in his heyday in the worst way
The five star surgeon general
Took Jay-Z to the alchem lab and gave him a blood test that
Came back G-A-M-E positive
The niggas infected with the game virus
Is over-rhetorical is so impeccable
That niggas in the street call him sarge
The young is down with violence
In his heart he's retired
It's not a game, it's just called a game
There'll be no referees, no half-time reports
When the game is over, the game is over
You can't put a card in the machine and get three more men

You know who to thank for that
Finished my second LP without a Dr. Dre track
You can take my soul but can't take my plaques
I'm the mothafuckin snare when it touch the beat
I'm the 808 drum that got you movin your feet
I'm the heir to the throne after the D-R-E
Product of my environment
You old ass niggas get ready for your early retirement
Before I let hip-hop burn down I'll run in the buildin' like a fireman
Who can outspit me when I'm high off sticky
Throwin' back Patron shots in some creased-up Dickies
I'm DOC certified, Ice Cube lynch man,
Snoop stamped me and the good Doc hand picked me,
You still with me?
Me and my mic can't be separated like Interscope and, ha ha...

Wake up in cold sweats, can't sleep,

I get drunk, but I ain't never smoke no wet
Been on tour 3 months and I ain't had no sex
Been meditating, exercising my mental bowflex
Michael Jackson dead, which one of us 'bout to go next
Me, Mary J, Robin Thicke or Britney Spears
Nigga I ain't afraid to die, tell the devil I'm right here
Hoe, I can take the strings out of these Nike airs
Tie it round the ceiling fan and end it right here
Kick the ladder 'cause I climbed that twice
Hate it or love it, I'm one blood nigga, it's my life
And I can die if I want to, and mama you can cry if you want to
Just tell my sons the truth and as the maggots eat away at my flesh
Let this iced out cross, walk through the bones in my chest

And now how it feel to be 52 and have a son that's a millionaire, and he don't fuck with you, daddy!
She was only in the six grade, the day I heard her scream, I should have hit you with the switch blade
Then she ran but I ain't know which way, she ended up in Vegas doing everything her pimp say

My little sister is a prostitute, and I'ma tell you what I'm about to do.

On my way to Michigan, not to see D12
I'm knocking on every door, ""have you seen this female?""
Here's a picture of my pretty baby sister
Here go one when she was ten and this one our last Christmas
Low light skinned girl, long curly black hair, sorry for wasting time, I know you probably don't care,
Feel like I walk longer than just 8 miles
Ran into a borded up BMF safe house
Made me think about all the time I spent with Meech makin' it rain in Magic city
When life was a Georgia peach
Now life is a rotton apple
Run faster than New York
You see my sister call me 'cause life is too short to get (lost)

She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler

My money or my glock who do I trust more?
I don't know it's probably the one that I touch more
Guess it's the green cause paper motivate niggas
And my rolex races cause it hate niggas

Huh, niggaz think they got the game sewed, yeah right
I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navi outside, I might be there
Black hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs
Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare
You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear
And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead
Then I'm goin' goin', back back
To the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns
'Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots
I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX
Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box
And when I die, bury me with the glock, and a bucket of shells
In case niggaz want drama in hell
(JT)
Yeah, so when Compton niggaz and Fillmoe niggaz get together
Shit happens mayne; real talk from ya nigga Fig'
Doin' it big and don't wanna split yo' wig
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
I'll give you anything you ask fo' - money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo' - fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo' - niggaz tried to play me man
(1) Anything you ask fo' - all about this Bay game
(2) Anything you ask fo' - representin Bay game
(JT)
I be the boy with the most cabbage, pluck strings like I'm Lenny Kravitz
I'm in the streets where they goin' savage
One, two, we dance on the rooftop
Let the Coupe ghostride then we come to two stops
Figga eight'n by the corner sto'
Niggarali from killer Cali you gotta let 'em know
Yeah, ya hit me on my Sidekick
Inventory pilin up, niggaz tryin' to buy shit
They got me diggin in my files
Pro Tools, ADAT tapes and big sounds
Jumpin' on a plane, jumpin' out a taxi cab
Stackin up this fettucini now these niggaz hella mad
""Fuck that nigga! He got another album on the board?""
Damn right, another album on the board
Fuck the bullshit, the Figgarali don't play
I represent the whole Bay every motherfuckin day
(Verse Three)
Count rubber band grands
I'm out big on the under, with my fam bam
And I, hover the lands
To expand, I'm from the gutter grime and the sand
No jams the flam's all busted
The dames want the bucks when, they see you stuffed in
Your pockets, till they get them some
But testin my pocket, only gets you none
'Cause I, got a pimp mentality
The scrubs wanna eat shrimp, and get my salary
They ain't knowin' I'm tight laced in my shoestrings
Hate the way I'm flowin on the mic, 'cause I do gleam
All types of baguettes and bezels
We shine like life's {?} rebels
2005, me and my crew just pile the pots
Move like the ice loose, pimp these thangs to watch"

'Cause ain't no real niggas out here

Bunch of bullshit, weak ass albums
Bunch of lil' niggas tryna copy our style
When we originated this, whole mothafuckin' album had hits
That's why we up in the Ritz
That's why I'm up in your bitch, head honcho
Get you killed pronto, wearin' red now, El Segundo
Bail long as Alonzo Mourning
Kill a nigga in his Monte Carlo like Alonzo
Sold records, sold crack, nigga, recognize
For the record, I've been wreckin' shit since '05
No lie, J's on
Take these mothafuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Rewind, J's on
Take these mothafuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Yeezy, tell these niggas that they is slaves
Master want you on red carpet like yesterday
You a house nigga, I'ma get away though
Come back kill master ass like Django
Most you niggas just rapping for the fame though
I start rapping to get the fuck out this durango
What goes around comes around how that saying go?
Documentary 2, no 50 keep the change hoe
Feelin' lonely
Let me know if you're feelin' crazy
I guess all that stuff they told me
In my life was extra shady
I should've kept 'em waitin'
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, no lie
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, good night
Feelin' lonely
Back like I never left, nigga I'm on my second breath
And I got another track from Yeezy
How'd you do that? Like Eric Wright said Eazy
Pull up in my cool whip, I don't give a fuck about it
Leave it at the valet, I ain't fucked up about it
I'll call an Uber, nigga, I'll fuckin' shoot a nigga
I got a white bitch that blow like a tuba, nigga
I just got a new crib, I just got a new Wraith
I just got cooler than LL Cool J
I just got a new gun, squeeze it like some toothpaste
I, I, (aghhhhk)
Spit in the face of a coward
Shit on anybody ever try to take ours
Ye why that nigga's face so sour?
'Cause that slick mouth got him wet up like a shower
Now what you know about power?
What you know about dreams?
What you know about freestylin' versus each other
Shelter outside of Nike Town without a dollar in your jeans

And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
'Cause they say you ain't grindin' until you die
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way through the day
A light for the night
Dear lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)
Like what the hell am I doing right?
Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away...
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away, like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide, I'm from a windy city
Like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fucking reason.
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces. (My life!)
Cause that's Jesus people, and Game he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Sigel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle (My life!)
I need some meditation, so I can lead my people
They askin' why?
Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question, 'fore this bullet leave this desert eagle
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you die
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way through the day
A light for the night
Dear lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)
Like what the hell am I doing right?
We are not the same, I am a Martian.
So approach my Phantom doors with caution.
You see them 24's spinnin'
I earned 'em.
I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music, and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson 'cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn I know his mama proud
And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like MJB, no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it outta town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty, like a glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you die
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way through the day
A light for the night
Dear lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)
Like what the hell am I doing right?
Walked through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on
Me and the devil sharing chronic blunts
Listening to The Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, and my Sox hat
I'm Paid in Full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
And you ain't grindin' until you die
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way through the day
A light for the night
Dear, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life (my life)
Like what the hell am I doing right?

Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor
Name me king

I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name me king

Brick by brick I built my fortress
My queen beautiful, Lamborghini is gorgeous
Phantom in the courtyard, 400 horses
Growl made the towers fall, 911 Porsches
Number 9 Jordans pause the Air Forces
Kush clouds, blunts lit by Olympic torches
Gold bars melted and what returned Rolexes
Niggas got Breitlings to burn
Loyalty to earn
Royalty to who it may concern this is Los Angeles King Snapback
Sipping 'tron out the Stanley cup, I don't give a fuck
Drown them in the moat and let the bridge up
My son, my heir in Nike Airs, named my little nigga King
Meaning you should bow at his feet before God intervene
Even when I was in front of triple beams
Stack paper to the ceiling, to the fiends I was king
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor
Name me king

I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses

Rollies cross oceans like Frank out in England
The Gay Pride bezel rainbow like it's spring again
Haah crack rock, crack rock nigga
My SC430 was a drop nigga
Go figure, this nigga play Go Fish
My only pet was fish scale not a goldfish
My young baby sitter now my old bitch
Blowjobs 'cause what I sold made her nose itch

Watch my predecessor fall like the sun going down (God!)
It's sunset, this is Sun Tzu (War!)
He paved the way I brought a ton through (Whooo!)
Been on his heels like a gum shoe
He took the throne so I could run through (YEAGHHHHH!)

Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses

Rose petals at my feet when I'm stepping out the Rolls
The royal penis is clean, Versace belt gold
Sweatin' like a slave where them pies get sold
Accompanied by fourteen karats stold
Adjust the temperature let the heat rise up
Like Jesus Shuttlesworth in that glass jar
Blue flame glowing like a Avatar
Five more minutes says the silent gold hand going 'round on my Audemar
Angels in the wing, ass naked do your thing
Show me what that baking soda bring, do it for your king
Every time I look up, they cook up
I be the master of them P's I got the hook up
From New Orleans to Virginia
I told her stuff them pies in her Virginia
Never been caught, can't be bought, she's a winner
Fly 'em south for the winter make it back home for dinner
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor

Ridin' shotgun put that chronic smoke in the air
Me against the world is what I told my foes
So it's me against the world till I poke them hos
Leanin out the window
Flickin ashes off the indo
Throwin' up westside I see one of my kinfolk
Put that blunt closer to my mouth cause only she knows
I'm feelin' bad about that nigga we stomped out in the casino
But fuck it its deathrow
The big homie never told me that my next blow would be my fuckin' death blow
Tell kadada I'm not ready I ain't even let my momma know
I ain't got no kids I'm only 24
Before I could let the smoke out niggas let 20 go
The 13 that hit the car went through the passenger door
(Chorus) Latoya Williams
Never can say goodbye
Never can say goodbye to my friends (X4)
I love it when they call me big poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look I gots ta catch the first thing smokin' the cali
And hit one of my bitches in the valley
Gotta call my nigga sean
Tell him reserve the don
Tell him to get the chron and the teflon
I think they trippin' off the homie gettin' shot
But god bless his soul lord knows it wasn't pop or the mafia
Kim tell cease get the fuckin' truck
We bout to hit the Wolersheim district get fucked up
Pop bad bottles son twist up the phillies
I'm thinkin' bout tiana these niggas is lookin' silly
If this was brooklyn I would ump the 9 milli

Ruthless I mean records we got married on my death bed
I can hear jerry heller in the hall
But I couldn't cube and dr. dre no more at all
Through all the bullshit them niggas were my dogs
Niggas wit atitude spray painted on the walls
I'm flatlinin its bad timin
Straight outta compton the king of gangsta raps dyin'
Cause of death the aids virus
Conspiricy I guess the government just hates violence
They thought my group influenced the L.A. riots
Woulda been here to see my kids grow if I stayed quiet
Took 12 years for a real nigga to break silence

And I was like, you know, I grew up, you know what I'm saying, on Nas and shit, and I wrote you know what I'm saying, I fuck with The Lox and shit, and Joe always showed me love when I come to New York. So I was like, you know, shit... I mean, I can't just stop fucking with niggas I've been listening to my whole life 'cause this nigga mad at them niggas for the time being. So, uhm, he was hot, but anyway, them niggas on the radio, I got hot, so you know at that time, I was in New York with 70 bloods nigga, so we went to the radio station and shit, hopped in a bunch of yellow cabs and shit, hopped out the motherfuckers and we walked up to Hot 97 before we could get to the door G-Unit security was already coming out and shit.

Is it Farrakhan, Buddha, or Christ today?
She on her knees so she know what it's like to pray
She got religious so she doin' it twice a day
I strap up, no I ain't throwin' dice today
When you got money on yo head it's a price to pay
And it get cold in the hood, put your ice away
They locked Rick Ross up and they ain't give him no bail
But a cracker shoot a whole church up and it's ""Oh well""
Oh well, oh well
Hang him with a confederate flag in his cell
Let him sit there and rot 'til his body turns to bones
Just remember who casted the first stone
New York, New York; good mornin' LA
Say hi to the Chi, celebrate to the Bay
No hesitation like Steph, shoot it right in your face
'Cause I'm a Golden State warrior strapped with a K
How's it land of the free, when we're trapped in a cage?
Some shit just never make sense like Magic and AIDS
Some shit just never make sense like bashin' the gays
Obama must be in the city, it's traffic today
Niggas trappin' today just like back in the day
We like Roc-A-Fella Records, we packagin' yay
And that Dirty Sprite 2 shit slappin' today
We got these niggas boxed in like Cassius Clay
And my Ferragamo belt where that ratchet stay
'Cause the police killing too many blacks today
I wake up in the morning like:""who gon' pass away? who gon' blast today? who gon' have to pray?""
New York, New York
Good morning L.A. My nigga Hayes blew him and his wife away
This song is dedicated to Stephanie Mosley, who was murdered from a single gunshot wound inflicted by her husband, Earl Hayes, in Los Angeles, California; December 18th, 2014. I knew Hayes since we were both signed to Aftermath back in 2005. And if I can keep it 8 more than 92 with you, he was a good nigga, I never saw that coming.

Get money, fuck bitches, that's what I'm about now
The Phantom, ugly, the Bentley, retarded

Headed to the airport, my flow flying in from Queens
Accompanied by my bitch, flying in with them things

Keep shooting them cap guns with the red nose tips
Have some Cali niggas come out and dead those strips
Give a fuck if you tuff nigga, or you buff nigga
My 4-5 weigh 3 pounds and it'll snuff niggas
Hop out the truck with the gun so long
Let the bullets jump out and ask, ""What's going on?""
What the fuck can I say? I grew up a bastard
Got sick in the Impala so I threw up a Aston
I pop big shit, and I keep my wrist slit
My entourage shine like the Diamond District

With so many rock, the Africans is trying to protest
Bully of the block, why? 'Cause they got me top 5
There's four niggas better than me? Nigga, stop lyin'!

Mase coming back and Hovie done.
I'm surrounded by legends, sitting at the round table, I am The Game and still niggas tryna play

Smokin' on that chronic drinkin' Ol' English
Rags tied gangs signs Letters on my hat in

Drive by homicide
R.I.P. tats in Ol' English Westside till I die
Niggas pourin' out that Ol' English (la-lala-la-la-la-la)
Once upon a time in the projects yo
I watched my uncle Greg put D's on his six-fo'
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Shopped crack and watched ""Colors"" and I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40-ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my pops flashed the 'Vette
Till one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend my pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Block they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass n**** wit' a Black Panther tat
Kill a n**** cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older I would understand that
It's blood in blood out and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks
13 that's when I had my first
I was the first n**** wit' a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and let the muthafuckas hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40-ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard so I stole my brother's glock
And that's the day my life changed 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that Chronic from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40-ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my adidas
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society
But I never left fingerprints on my
I got a lot of dead homies some blood some crip
This is life stop watchin' that ""Boyz N The Hood"" shit
You see this red rag hangin' out of my jeans?
I went to twenty funerals by the age of ninteen
Then I went to college basketball was my dream
Quit the team 'cause I rather shoot rock wit' the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac thought I was rich bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin' till I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit
So I got her name tatted in

155,On Me,2015,The Documentary 2 (2015),Hip Hop,The Game,"Oh no no
Oh no no
Oh no no
Oh no no
Back when Dot was hangin' at Top's in the Benzo
Freestylin' to them Chronic instrumentals, no pens and pencils
I was out there Bloodin' like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals, way back when
When we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin' rentals in front of Centennial, remedial thoughts
Never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin' shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck, to dishraggin' bitches
That was hard to fuck, I came up, it was hardly luck
Just left Compton, and I ain't have to use my AK
What a day, what a day
Back when my drivers license, was baby faced and triflin'
I made my way through crisis, I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens, I made you hate the vibrant
You can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where I've been
In '98 my problem, actin' too grown and shit
Cappin' at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
Bitch I'm well-connected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin' with Tetris if your block neglectin' your ki
Everyday I wake up with my face up to my father
Makin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest All my king stuffin', double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my deja vu done caught up
Bitch I'm brought up with the homies, that's on me
24/7, Kendrick revvin' these cold streets
Know we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, ""Drive by it,"" I raise AK
Ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I'll play
Like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe
Documentary had identities of where I'm from
Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'
Nigga it's Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy's done, BLAOW!
Oh man, you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity it's still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella
There I go, give me a minute, nigga
'Bout to hit a home run, K. Dot, grab the pennant, nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton, trap late night, Jay Leno them
Got my mom a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon of Wilmington
Now can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute
Look in my rhyme book, see murder like when I was a fan of No Limit
Ain't no gimmicks 'round here, this Compton, me, Doc and Kendrick
Chronic, good kid, my first year, 3 documentaries
Now I'm blockin' sentries, 16 Impalas
They bounce like they Iguodala
That's on my mama, niggas up and did me a solid
I put that on me, that's on me
You get a bullet fuckin' with the lil' homie
Thinkin' back then like fuck your rules, nigga this is Piru
Slide through with the Erykah Badu
West side Compton, nigga don't mind if I do
From Piru Street to my old street
Nigga this Compton, grew up on a dead end
Got an armful of dead friends
Round here Crips be sweatin' us niggas like a headband
Like what's up 'cause
(Yo dawg where you from?)
No time to stop and think
Pull your strap before they do or you get shot before you blink
Straight outta Compton, 3 times I told you
The third time I said it with TDE mothafucka
I'll make you eat every letter
Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers, from the city of Impalas
When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers
My clip full, I quick pull, no more slangin' 8 balls on the corner
And all them niggas I used to freestyle with, I ate y'all on the corner
Call the coroner, niggas dead out here
Hangin' onto life by a thread out here
Them niggas wearin' all that red out here
P snapbacks on niggas heads out here
So don't you come fuckin' with the little homie
So OG they call me Tony
Montana, no French, my red bandana legit
My uncle told me before he died, ""Just keep your hand on the brick""
So I did
Sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock, yes I did
Walked to Compton, hot pocket full of rocks, yes I did
Skipped class, yes I did, whooped niggas ass, yes I did
Fucked a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag, that's on Bloods
Westside, that's on Bloods, this TEC fly, that's on Bloods
You fuck with Dot, I'll let you choke on your blood
I put that...
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me

I'm a muthafuckin' gang bangin' Nightmare
Wake up mudaf**kers, I traded in my white Nike Airs
For a red pair of converse, Back to the hood
My own niggas actin' like I turned my back on the hood
I used my rap money to put crack in the hood
Even brought the nigga Dr. Dre back to the hood
I show niggas the Bentley, then let you drive it
Gone for 2 days and I didn't even check the mileage
When we was fighting with Crips it wasn't 'bout no dollars
It was about selling dope to put our kids through college
I'm sittin' on the block reminiscing for hours
Whipping my tears 'cause now half of my niggas is cowards
And I was still fuckin' with niggas
After I got shot and didn't get one hospital visit
My homie Snoop told me it be days like this
It hurt my heart to say this shit
I only fuck with you on two occasions
When I'm drunk, when I'm high
I will be broke, if I would be with you
That is why it's for one night (one one one one...)
Red bandanna in my back pocket I'm for real
This ain't no pastel color kacki suit and I ain't Pharrell
I don't front bout shit, I pull my gun bout shit
And let everything fly to keep my son up out of this
I thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap
Remember, the bullet holes in my son's car seat
My baby momma found four shells
I ain't get one keep your head up
All I got was keep it real, Keep it real my niggas?
Last year alone I spent 1.5 mil on my niggas
After the bullshit I stayed right there
Took you to award shows there go Jay right there
""Where?"" ""Right there""
I had you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs
I'm suppose to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear
The last 12 months been a fuckin' nightmare
This shit is worst then arguing with my bitch
I done been through more up and downs then an Impala swith
Get your hand out of my pocket nigga, go fish
I was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit
Nigga you tell me, what you want me to do
Drop my son off at home and come bang with u?
Oh now it's fuck Game, Naw Nigga fuck u
I put that on my life, matter of fact that's on Piru
And really is I can die too
And end up in the cemetery, right beside you
We can both ride, Angels flying over my head stone
But the devils inside your box
You wanted my shine so I gaved you ice
Then I gaved you a second change and you played me twice
Couldn't be a real homeboy to save your life
I should of took Dr.Dre's advise"

1 niggas down, 2 niggas run it
Game and the snowman, 100 miles and gunning
Here come the paramedics!
It goes 1 for the money, 2 for the dough
On the count of 3, niggas kicking at your door
Here come the paramedics!
It goes 1 for the ghetto, 2 niggas run it
Game and the snowman, 100 miles and gunning
Here come the paramedics!
(Verse 1: Young Jeezy)
Here come the pain! I've got a name
Ever since an adolescent I've been deep in the game
All I need is more weed, a little something for the pain
So good like a hook from T-Pain
They say you're nobody till somebody kills you
I say ""go be somebody, even if it kills you..""
They say ""death smells like bad ass weave""
Another watch, another chain: last thing a nigga needs
I swear to God, a couple right by the night stand
Clip my half a hundred, case another hundred grand
And get some rest when your conscious keep waking ya
The evil kicks in and them demons start shaking ya
Every night, dude, I wake up in a cold sweat
Get dressed and hit the club in a cold vest
God damn, girl, you so sexy, cold shit
But why they still riding to your old shit?
Party by the beat, all still riding with ya
Party by the big riders, still siding with ya
Party by the real niggas still hustling to ya
I know you're here in the day, ain't nothing to ya
They say pictures worth about a thousand words
These niggas talking like they really worth a thousand birds
Here come the paramedics, bitch I done told you
When niggas calling beef, it's for the tofu
(Verse 2 - Game)
See us riding like some mobsters, with the trunk full of choppers
Give a nigga a couple shots, and I ain't talking about vodka
Hanging out the sunroof, Snowman driving
Nigga live through these shots: Put his ass on Survivor!
Fresh up at the trap, I ain't never been a rat
Get cheese like a mouse, so I'm honest throwing stack
Let you suckers make it rain, I'll make it Katrina
And pile all them hoes in the back of my Beemer
Hit the freeway, bumping ""Ghetto Boys"", with the V12 steaming
Top down, in the rain, California dreaming
I'd be lying if I said I still flip birds
...Well nigga I still flip birds!
Word to the doors on this ? I'm sitting on
Ain't a rapper alive me and Jeezy ain't shitting on
Who else you know shit out Benjamins, and piss Patron?
Put Michael Buffer between us, and let's get it on!
(Verse 3 - Game)
(Hey Snowman, these niggas hustling backwards
I'mma pull the K out, and turn 'em back around)
Look, if I give you half a chicken, can you break that bitch down?
Tell the truth, it's me nigga, ain't nobody else around
Jeezy said it's a recession, so we hustling that Mayweather
My ? the best pound for pound, like Mayweather
Undisputed: I never lost a brick
UPS, FedEx and duct tape to a bitch
Put her ass on that greyhound
Tell that ho to stay down
Sleep the first 48, and wake up in the A-Town
Give a fuck about a bitch
Die for the paper, hustle relentless
Nigga, I take the sky from a scraper
The Gerber out a baby mouth, the fire out of Satan's house
These rappers turned saints, we pull them fucking gauges out
Black Tims kicking in the door, at your lady house
He at the strip club, well fuck it, we gon wait it out
You tipped him off, so now all the K's is out
We ?, shot him down from the neighbor's house"

161,Pot of Gold,2011,The R.E.D. Album (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"(Chorus - Chris Brown)
All this bright light is not for me
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home!
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never try to follow that rainbow
In search for the pot of gold!
Oh, oh, oh!
In search for the pot of gold!
(Verse 1 - Game)
'Bout there right now
About to have an extra?
Searching for a pot of gold like a lepricon,
They say death comes in three, two next in line,
I lost a best friend for the second time.
Now I'm on the quest to find peace,
Still gotta carry my business when it's
You don't understand, I'm misunderstood,
Get in the smoke two more hours, then I'm done for good.
So ten million records ain't mean the hood,
It's a cold world, everybody in the hood
And everybody doing time, staying here strong,
You still got a chance to let, even though you did wrong.
(Chorus - Chris Brown)
All this bright light is not for me
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home!
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never try to follow that rainbow
In search for the pot of gold!
(Verse 2 - Game)
Sometimes I try to do good,
But I just can't be!
It's hard to get myself to do things that ain't be.
You all should thank me,
But my haters try to send me home early,
But you came home to?
I ain't a saint, Bee, I ain't Gaga,
I ain't the angel leader but I try harder.
I'm like light for my soldiers at war,
I sit back and watch the ashes on my Sedan fall.
(Chorus - Chris Brown)
All this bright light is not for me
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home!
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never try to follow that rainbow
In search for the pot of gold!
Oh, see the thing about all of us,
We never know just what we find.
(Chorus - Chris Brown)
All this bright light is not for me
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home!
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never try to follow that rainbow
In search for the pot of gold!
Yeah! In search for the pot of gold."
162,Pray,2012,Jesus Piece (2012),Hip Hop,The Game,"She got on tights with the leather skin
She a rockstar, bring the heavy metal in
Girl shaped like a coke bottle, Medellín
In love with her till she went and let the devil in
She pop pills like medicine
She probably gon' die, it's startin' to be evident
I told her, ""Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent""
I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev in there
And I can't let this girl throw her life away
Kick the door in the room and told her to put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons, the girl like night and day
Stressed out, parents getting divorced
Girl love 'em both, she ain't tryin' to sit in court
She a square so it's hard to see the angle
And that's why God gave her an guardian angel, it's me
And I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She ain't had no pride, so she went and did a year for him
She a ride-or-die, like Eve and them
Make home-cooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her
Takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah, grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin' on the door H.A.M
Then he bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me
When I wake up every day
Even though she doubted me
I thank the lord that we are safe
Even though she doubted me
Again, yeah
Even though she doubted me
That's why we pray for me
That's my momma and I love her with my heart like I love you
If you strugglin', baby daddy ain't takin' care of the kids girl
You can get a hug too
I'm here whenever you need me
Gon' reach out, it's that easy
I love women, cause without women
Wouldn't none of us niggas be breathin'

Cause even though a nigga wanna tap that shit
I don't wanna be the one to wreck that shit, so
So I fall back, year go by I got more plaques
Just to call from you tellin' me you miss me
And you wanna see me next time the tour's back, damn

Every time she think about me on the road
She be cryin' realizin' all the places that she ain't been

Hold you down, lift you up

I'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up
So we fuck, say what?

Then he went and did a bid all cause a bitch burned that nigga

Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come out
Man we strugglin, it's hard sometimes, but
Tomorrow's better than yesterday, uh
(The Game)
I was, born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction, darker complexion
Made it hard to live; dad, how you fathered your kids?
Stranded on the highway of life, left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shhhh, I'm still here, my mother's cries
Nigga no father figures make harder niggaz
Through the years, went to war with niggaz from what I saw in the picture
Now your son is bigger, 13, but just like you
Moms said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me just like you
Gunnin for riches, runnin' hoppin project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin till my coffee diminish
Why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin, huh
(The Game)
Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before the game, everything came with pain
Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn
Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father, that have the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree
I can see him rollin' over in his coffin
I'm left with often, thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man you oughta, be dead in a grave
But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage
High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Woulda been dead in an hour
Heard you was scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker
(The Game)
All my niggaz listen, huh
I stay a step ahead of the rest of y'all
Why I gotta keep a vest for y'all
Though I made it dog I still stress for y'all
Funny how my folks think rap money stretch so far
Pray to God my niggaz see through all the checks and the cars
I'm tryin' to invest in what's ours, gimme a couple of years dog
I'll turn your tears stress and your scars
Into lawn chairs and green grass in your yard
I'm tryin' to watch my kids wrestlin yours
Not have to get 'em ready for school and strap a vest on 'em all
I know sometimes it get hard
Keep your head up mami, reach for the stars
Havin' a child is like a blessing from God
You just gotta work hard, can't let your youngest star strip in that bar
I feel your pain, this shit is rippin my heart
But where and when do we start, listen to the voice in back of my mind
Can't reach all my women so I attack it in rhyme
I know what you're feelin', I'm wripin ya tears ma, it could happen in time
For now I take your tear strife sufferin, imagine it mine, huh"

But you know I'm always open to suggestions
I said let me be the one
Down for you, it should never be a question, babe
To blow your mind, away, away, my time
To blow your mind, away, away, my time
Don't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time
To blow your mind, to blow your mind
Yeah, Quik is the name
With The Game, it's a goddamn shame
Niggas can't see that we to blame
For putting Compton to flames
Ignite it up, haters knotted up
When you trip with canker sores in your whip
That's what I do, to protect my party
My goons snatch you out by your Ed Hardy
Then its back to shawty, all the ladies drink free
All the players grab a tab, that's how that's supposed to be
Drinking Casamigos, fucking faster than grand national regals
I'm in it in the pussy doing kegals
I'm so Fred Segal right now
She so spread eagle right now
Ain't nothing but the clothes going down
I'm in the game and the fire's the same
My music is infinite like even before my fame
I wrote about a thousand 16-bar verses
And I'm still coming off like this my first hit
I hope you giving head today
'Cause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)
Baby we gon' celebrate, celebration
You bring all your girls and I'ma bring my crew, let me be the one
One you take home at the end of the night babe, let me be the one
I only want you to myself babe, let me be the one
But you know I'm always open to suggestions
I said let me be the one
Down for you, it should never be a question, babe
To blow your mind, away, away, my time
To blow your mind, away, away, my time
Don't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time
To blow your mind, to blow your mind
Now DJ Quik got a bitch from the Bay
Say she wanna fuck his lil homie, got her sipping on that Alize
You ever had your dick sucked to Mausberg before?
And had a Mossberg pump leaning on the front door?
Treat my dick like a newborn, hold the head
I told a bitch ""Pimpin' ain't dead, hoes are scared
So stop that bickering,"" I got a bitch from the Nickersons
That got a fucking bounty on my head, uh oh
I'm rhyming with Chuck Taylor too, he doing something new
Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to
So lady, go on and work those hips
Like them inmates work those divs
And when I get there baby work your lips
If it don't make dollars don't holler
It's DJ Quik in any year Impala
And if it don't make sense then don't flinch
What you hear from a bull that don't chew no grass?
No shit
I hope you giving head today
'Cause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)
Baby we gon' celebrate
You bring all your girls and I'ma bring my crew, let me be the one

Don't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time
To blow your mind, to blow your mind
Sucking on my dick
She's a bad, bad girl
Uh, h-hold on, hold on, baby
Your head hit the button, girl
We on the li-
Z-boy fro, yo man are we live?
We still live, huh?
Damn girl, don't stop though
Hit you off with something brand new
A Travis Barker produced joint, believe it or not
Hold on, let me hit this button"
169,R.I.P. Story,2011,Purp & Patron (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"I gotta sing you rap niggas a song before I put you to bed
So close your eyes just one last time as I put you sleep
Nigga rest in peace, you don't want no beef,
Don't make me pull the piece on em, throw up the peace on you
Rest in peace, you don't want no beef,
Don't make me pull the piece on em, throw up the peace on you
As I hit corners in that Lamborghini swervin'
Them doors fly up, look like I'm riding in a bird
So sick, put the 22's a inch from the curb.
Watch the niggas fade away like the smoke from the herb.
So I hop out, in my true religion denim,
Cause guns my true religion,
And my Desert Eagle's in 'em.
Then I pull out;
Like I should have did when I was twelve, she had a miscarriage anyway,
Oh well, back to my story.
I start shootin' up the block
They shootin' up block, ""Oh shit! It's the cops!""
No is not, (woohoohoohoo)
It's just the ambulance, put another clip in and let the hammer dance.
I swear to God, these niggas runnin' so fuckin' fast that,
One nigga tripped so I shot him in the ass.
""Why you make me do that?""
I'm usually a cool cat, like Kool Herc, Kool G, or any other cool nigga that rap.
But I ain't come to talk, I came for revenge; to avenge the death for my hip-hop friends.
I know, I know you never meant to get 'em killed, never meant to drive the car,
They never handed you the steel
Apologize now. I know when you see him you will,
But I got one question:
""Nigga how does it feel that they're going now, and you're going now?""
Put it to his dome, (BLAAAOW!) He is going home now, bye.
My Air Force Ones are comfortable, but they not built to last
Especially when you chasin' motherfuckers up and down the ave.
Niggas hit a couple fences, ran through some backyards,
And I am not Reggie Bush, I'm heading back to my car.
As I walked around the corner, I was like,
""Damn! Los Angeles PD's behind my Lam - Bo.""
Runnin' my plates, before I can hit the gate,
I can hear the cops yelling out, ""Wait!""
So I turn around, approach my shit,
He said: ""Aren't you the guy that used to sing with 50 Cent?""
""Why, yes I am.""
That was my reply,
""My daughter loves your songs, good day.""
""Good bye!"""

That them big motherfuckers is twenty-five
Swayin in and out of white line, six double-oh

Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman/Ali combined
If there's beef, I'm releasin mine
And I won't stop bustin' till them Escalade seats recline
The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies

And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him

A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns

And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey

Throw your motherfucking Cincinnati hats in the sky
Nigga don't ask why
Red laces in and out of them Air Max '95's
I, walk on the moon, flow hotter than June
Any nigga want drama I kick up a sand dune
Peace to my man Tune for giving his man room
Now we hitting switches to the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it? Naw forget it, SuuWoo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don't live in Judah's eyes
Half of these rappers wasn't trapping when I was chopping the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma ""Won't you decide?""
She chose Doc, first day I poured you aside like its Aftermath for life
And all I do is ride
Before I turn on him I kill Satan, and stick my red flag in the ground
It's red nation!
(Chorus - Lil Wayne)
Now Blood the fuck up
Everyday's a gamble motherfucker tough luck
And we going to fuck the world till that bitch bust nuts
I can't tell you what's good, but I can tell you what's, what
And that's, B's up, hoes down
Looking in the mirror, I'm nowhere to be found
Blood, I'm a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwing Blood in the air, leave blood on the ground
(Verse 2 - Game)
Niggas'll trade they soul to be Drake or J. Cole
Live and die for this shit, word to Tupac Shakur's halo
One Blood, plural, nigga I'm spending Euro's
Ferrari got a ice cream paint job, Dorrough
I'm up out the hood, where they pull them guns on you like
Come up out your hood, it ain't never all good
We roll up in backwoods, nigga get to acting stupid
Get thrown in the back woods
Los Angeles, home of the scandalous
Pimp, hoes, and gamblers
Ninety eight degrees on Christmas
Nigga we rolling cannabis
Swisher Sweet ain't it?
I told her I'm Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panties down, stain it
That's my Chi-lingo, yeah I'm bi-lingual
Ball by myself, nigga Ochocinco
""Dancing With the Stars"", bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here, word to God
(Verse 3 - Game)
Russia got a red flag
U.S. got red stripes
""Last Train to Paris"", around the world in these red Nikes
Che Guevara of the New Era, test me
Louisville Slugger, you'll get buried in my New Era
Got that 'Natti on, tighter than a Magnum
Walk in the club sagging with a .38 magnum
Red Ralph Laurens, the double R sitting on a hill like Lauren
Her and the car foreign
Got my red Dre Beats on, trying to put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at?
Roll up the weed son
So many Bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while I'm out here, I might as well go shopping
And put this new bad bitch, I got her some Red Bottoms
And all these hating ass niggas want me dead

Throw it up for the king of LA

Long as I'm from Compton, California I could never go soft
I'm hard as a mothafuckin ounce of raw
Dribble rock like Kobe Bryant bounced the ball
Fuck the law
Feedin my son is a must
Whip it soft, whip it hard

Why Andrew Jackson look high as fuck on the twenty?

Now that 'Pac passed
Tryin' to put us on death row
Get ready for the aftermath
I run through the city like Godzilla
Doin' more damage than Ice-T when he dropped Cop Killer
Pull a shotty out the trunk of the Chevy
There go another victim of a 1-8-7
Who's the grim reaper with your life in his hand?
Even the toughest niggas run when my gun go blam
So kick back and watch the bitches dance
N.W.A. is back, now let me see your mothafuckin hands
I'm back by popular demand
And so all black interior on a cherry red 6-4
Niggas endin they careers tryin' to shut me up
Actin' like I traded in my khakis for a button up
The West coast still pimpin'
Game still bloodin, and Snoop still crippin
So what you sayin' lo (?)
Red and blue bandana tied in a knot
As I creep through the chronic smoke
They say it ain't good weed if you don't choke
Shit got my head spinnin like the hundred spokes
Three-wheelin' through the neighborhood, system on blast
As the motherfuckin one-time passed (?)
The key to drive-bys is to aim steady
Turn that fake (?) into confetti
When you cross that enemy line, close your eyes

Blood of a slave, heart of a giant
Had to leave Aftermath, Dre said I was too defiant
That was five years ago, look how fast it go
Destroyin' Interscope, shot myself like Plaxico
But fuck that, blaze one, where the matches yo?
Hit the freeway and see how fast the Aston go
Roll the window down, clip off the ashes so
You can see all my diamonds and how much cash I blow
How many bitches I fuck, how many cars I drive
How many goons I got, count 'em and they all outside
Niggas try to shut me up like Malcolm
But standin' in the window caine smoking was the outcome
Sometimes I get a little stressed and pop a Valium
Hit Hollywood late night and knock down a stallion
So niggas think twice about my medallion or
You'll hear Cuba Gooding yelling ""Ricky! ""
My nostalgia is one hundred percent Compton and zero percent snitch
Park a Bentley and the Phantom on blocks while I use the bitch
Made the Cincinnati fitted more famous than Griffey did
And just to think, several years ago they tried to split his wig
Two to the chest, struck his heart, one hit his rib
Then I blacked out, like a movie, all I could hear...
Feelin' all fucked up, woke up to a doctor
All I could think about, was that the cops took my weed and my choppers
They want me to sing, like Sinatra, I told the detective
Get this clear like Belvedere vodka
Them five shots created a monster
Hell's Kitchen comin' straight out of Compton
I seen Boyz in the Hood, Morris Chestnut was a actor
2Pac was the real life ""Ricky! ""
Then they shot down the nigga that shot him, I swear to God
If I'm lying then Compton is New York and I'm Rakim
I'm from where niggas get murdered over stock rims
And punched in the jaw just for a cocked brim
Nobody mama let the cops in, we ain't got no options
Wanted to be a boxer, but I was boxed in
Then my grandmother house went up for auction
And that's what tipped [?], I'm goin' back to buy the block then
Too many niggas locked in, dig up Cochran and defend all my niggas
With they faith under stockings, rather face God then 25 with no options
If Compton ain't the murder capital, we in the top ten
Drive by with our face painted, like a clown
With a tre-pound, forty shells bouncin' off the ground
This how my living room sound, when my brother got shot down..."

If I catch a murder one nigga I'm runnin'
Homicide come around and they keep on coming
That's why I'm out of state and I keep on runnin'
I ain't Nelly but my desert eagles on girl
Just dropped bail traveling the world
When I sign my deal I said fuck jail
I went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil
This shit real fuck an appeal
D's want my head like that bitch in Kill Bill
Sling dope sling crack and them e pills
That's why I'm on the low like a dead navy seals
I'm runnin'
(Game)
'Cause I gotta pack them shows
And Dre told me ain't no coming back from Go
So I gotta get my album in place
My G-Unit features
My Eminem sixteens
My Dr. Dre beats
And it was two years from today when I started rhyming
And took my demo to Suge and he ain't sign me
Niggaz threatening my life like it's hard to find me
See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis
My mom said I'm hard head
I don't follow the rules
Why should I when Reebok giving niggaz they own shoes
And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got
Yayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot
I'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock
Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot
And niggaz trying to gun me down in the rim shop
'Cause I just want the same recognition that the crypts got
They say I'm the next in line and if I get shot
Then I go out as the Bobby Fischer of hip hop
Make yo chest move
Sylvia Rome and Kevin Lyle slept cool
Jimmy Iovine was the best move"
178,Scared Now,2012,Jesus Piece (2012),Hip Hop,The Game,"Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck fed now
Had to hit him with the shotty nigga

Gansters, this is how we roll
Jesus Piece, and it's out of gold
Versace polo and a pound of dro
Hop in that Ghost, and it's adios
Who the fuck scared now?

Chased that nigga down, put him on worldstar
Bitch nigga got away, in his girl's car
Put that pussy on the net like a pornstar
Another weenie with bread, he a corndog
Put 3 holes in his head, like a bowling ball
I'm out the gutter switching lanes in a stolen car
Fuck the feds, cause a nigga got a murder charge
Fuck it though, got the cover of the murder dog
I dress up like the pizza man, load the desert eagle and
I don't just hit ya team, I wet the whole bleachers, damn
Specialize in the murder game

Had to hit him with the shotty nigga
Another dead fucking body nigga
I'm the most feared rap nigga
Like a Just Blaze beat, I'll clap niggas
This ain't a Just Blaze beat, this ain't wrapped nigga
Voletta Wallace lost her son to a gat nigga
What if I told y'all I know who killed Biggie dog?
I ain't no snitch but if I did it ain't no biggie dog
Cause that's Biggie dog
All that's coming out the mouth of the nigga you used to know as being 50's dog
But I got tired of being 50's dog
Had to break my chain and cut that nigga 50 off
Whole team celebrating, label on my dick hard
Interscope asking ""would I take 50's call""
Hello? Put up 10 mill for a real nigga
Drop this joint album and we'll kill niggas
G-Unit!
Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck fed now
Had to hit him with the shotty nigga
Another dead fucking body nigga
All these niggas claiming they OG, my young boys will murder them
Cold shooters, that 16, and they ain't ever even heard of them
I slide through, I get a bird of them
And they drive through, and they serving them
These niggas talking that beef shit, I put bread on it, no burger bun
We walk up in this bitch like ""what?""
Rollie on my wrist lights up
Told these niggas ""can't do it like us""
Ciroc boy, and I do it like Puff
With 100 bottles, 100 models
No twitter, we come to follow
Straight shots and no Moscato
I fuck them hoes, don't give a fuck bout em
Now tell me who's scared now?
Shots fired, man down
Dead bodies get found
That chopper clip spits rounds
And real niggas get murdered
Top dogs get it first
He came to me in that Benz
And he left from here in a hearse
Woah!
Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck fed now
Had to hit him with the shotty nigga
Another dead fucking body nigga"

Where skinny niggas make buff niggas victims of tht trey pound
N gang bangers is the sharp shooters we don't need no roof top
Jus knock his ass down and take the money out his tube sock
West coast niggas is back on the map
If only for now until the next time my body attract
From the first clap I heard rap
Now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back
And take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest niggas
Make money with the smartest niggas
I ain't got time for you fuckin' artist niggas
You better shut your trap before you become a target nigga
Y'all army brats I'm the muthafuckin sergeant nigga
Beauty pageant ass niggas on the runway
Boyz in the hood till they see tht nigga in the red hyundia
Blow his fuckin' back out

Let the critics ask questions my album b the answer
These niggas let the rumors
Sit in they head like tumors
So I had to take 'em back tooth brush on the pumas
Clean
Mean
Rapping machine
Red rag hanging low in the back my jeans
I black out like February
Back I was necessary
07 bugatti with jimmy iovine secretary
I run in the building
Don't make me run in the building
No this ain't the first time I had my gun in a building
Walkin' past officers I see my son in the building
Last album on the wall I'm number one in the building
They should build me a office up under the building
My elevator goin' down I am done in the building
Nigga

180,See No Evil,2012,Jesus Piece (2012),Hip Hop,The Game,"I don't read the XXL
Told em.45 the church, think I'm destined for hell, oh well
Blood tears off the face of my Jesus Piece
It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets
I'm from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets, born in Blood nigga
In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga
Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plugged the nigga
Used to pull the gun out, just because of cause niggas
Five shots to the head 'cause I'm a Blood nigga
Nuttin' brewing but suwoo'ing where the fuck I'm from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin' down Green Leaf
No peace so don't get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger, we cooking that real beef
Momma's mourning they sons, I'm talking real grief
Real funerals of them lost Juveniles
Trying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh
Say it's a blessing when you die in ya sleep
Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capishe
I'm sayin', stop playing, wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms, now a caskets what he pray in, Compton streets raised me
Can't tell my grandma nothing 'bout her baby, you crazy
I said she see no evil
She gonna knock it at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'm a see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then?
What happened then?
I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a jag
A cut for my dogs with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried, even when discouraged
Skirt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone
Shirt off when precesure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic cause rats is what I'm talking about
I'm hearin the sonics of gun fire
The whispers, the silent cries even though I know it's an eye for an eye
I said she see no evil
She gonna knock it at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'm a see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then?
What happened then?
You want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there
Hough City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh
Niggas can't hear you talking from the sky
And only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Call my catchers up to all you head honchos
2 Dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though
Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmother's friends says said ""You niggas had never wanted peace.""
Los Angeles, I'm the motherfucking king here
No first 48 cause motherfuckers don't sing here
I said she see no evil
She gonna knock it at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'm a see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then?

It's not usual, the game be, all up on some South shit
Straight West Coasting, you can tell by my outfit
Red 'nati fitted, ""Blood in, Blood out"" shit
Empty jelly jars, nigga, bird in the couch shit
The mad rapper, Oscar the Grouch shit
Except when I'm hopping out of cans, I'm pulling out shit
Dippin' a 4 though, double X 3-D Polo
If hip-hop was the league, I'd be the motherfuckin logo
Your last shit was so-so, you should sign to Jermaine
I've been hard since I was solo
Niggas feel my pain, I make it rain without the strippers
Go against the grain, and push your shit back like some clippers
I bang and then I hang out at the Staples like Blake Griffin
You can tell I'm getting money the way that glass house is sitting
I mash out the strip then like Nash when I'm dippin
Feeling like God's Son, the way that It Was Written
Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn me down, turn me up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
'Cause I got another ounce up in the stash
Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn me down, turn me up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
'Cause I take 2 hits, and then I pass
(Verse 2: Game)
I see the cops in the rearview, why can't a motherfucker chill in the car
Feelin' like Missy, why you all up in my grill
They must know that I got bird stashed all up in my grill
Camouflage by the Armor All while it's sparkling off my wheels
And I fuck hoes that prey on Dwight Howard and Shaquille
Not them throwback rats they be on showin' college hill
For real, I think my first album sold 5 mil'
And you say to yourself ""He's broke""
Well how the hell am I ballin', like Spalding
I did a couple of movies, now agents calling and calling
Can't get to the phone right now cause balls is all in this bitch mouth
When did we start taking these tricks out?
Now she gon' run her big mouth and tell her girlfriend
You had her all up in the wind
Blowing yo cheese on Louie Vuitton, and now that bitch is in the wind
And after the next draft, she gon' start that cycle again
How you claimin' that bitch when she with him?
Come again cause
(Verse 3: Big Boi)
Daddy Fat Sax, if my balls are on your chin, then can you tell me where my dick's at?
Gag order ghetto, head hunter, head buster through the chit-chat
I skip to the lou, my darling bring the thunder, I'm the lightning that strikes twice
Motherfucker, call me massa, 'cause I runs the plantation and I'm whooping niggas asses If they disrespect the presentation
Below the Mason-Dixon, we facin' the basis, never missin' pimpin'
You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation
My mojo is never fadin', I'm in my Optimus Prime transform
Switch it up, heat it up, speed it up, that means I'm gone
Light years, ahead of your Buzz, Toy Story and club songs
Boy, gone, the A-T-L-iens are phoning home
But I feel like a librarian, cause style's are being' loaned out like books
A castle full of crooks, rape and pillage
They'll do anything for money, I bet misleading the village
(Verse 4: E-40)
Not from New England, but I pack a patriot
Not from Atlanta, but I got the cater
Not from Chicago, but I'm a bear
I'm a bay area nigga, 49er, Raider
I'm about my bread man, I ain't no sucker
Now these bitch ass niggas soft as table butter
I'm about my riches, magazines, street hustler
You can ask your uncles, daddies, mothers, and your older brothers
But I used to flea flick that yola white
Sellin' that shit below the retail price
I'm a rare breed like the bike club, get it right
Desperado like Toriono, shout out to Dynamite
I got my red cup, and some green
What kind of green you smoking pimp? Blue dream
My nigga let my hit that there hemp, do your thing

Caught you walkin' out that gucci store in manhattan
I was in chains and cuffs, you was with cha girls
I was in that aftermath chain, you was in pearls
It was me against the world, baby girl
You had dreams of stardom,
The prince of compton meets the queen of harlem
First date at mr chows it was culture I would coach ya
La pearla, gucci, louie, finde, prada, dolce
Runnin' circles in my living room, tearing up sofas
Me clear in the rover, fuck it ma lets tear up the highway
Let the sprewells spin till the plates fell off
Then we could go 1 on 1 at dres house
Jeans painted with the waist cut out
You rockin' the fly way that lil bit of compton mixed with bed stuy way
And girl I'm not trying to excite you,
I'm tryna wife you, bamboo earing, white air nike you

The way you smile, the way you swingin' them hips when you walk
The way you look, the way you ride when you workin them thighs
The way you licken your lips when you look in my eyes
You down for me, I'm down for you
You go down on me, I'll go down on you
I wanna do all the things that your man wont do
I'm from the hood, so I know how to handle you
Keep you in pink rocks and g-unit canvas shoes
Show you how to gangsta lean when the lambo move
Ill take you to new york city, atlanta too
Show you how to fly them birds and them hammers through
And you know...

Let me tell you 'bout the birds and bees
How I stand on the block all day and flip birds and keys
Your boyfriend don't like me, 'cause he don't get a fourth of my cheese
And you can take back the porsche and his keys
Hop in the range rover, you ain't gotta force him to leave

You got gucci frame covering the mark on your face
'Cause he don't want you to leave and I don't want you to stay
Sometimes I wanna snatch that nigga out tha CLK

I wanna ease ya pain, kick off your louie sandles
Let me, whip your tears with my g-unit bandana
Make me wanna peal you out them jeans when you rockin' em

Weather we lovers or friends we'll always be

Ran the west for a decade nigga, check the bio
Gave you Cincinnati fitteds like I get it in Ohio
Autographs on the vinyl made the Lamb albino
Straight away in the Wraith, that's a Peyton Manning spiral
You lookin' at your idol, Jesus wrote the Bible
Yeezus, that's my Nike town rival
Dare a nigga try me now, like why me now
Lookin' for Red Octobers, I will tie him down
Stay laced, spit nothin' but based, yeah

If I could start from scratch I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana, same 45th
Same G-wagon, same hood-rat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin' up my shit
Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin' up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same dog food album bangin' in my tape deck
Homie if I could make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I would have told Pac not to stomp Orlando
Told Puffy and B.I.G. about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga tez
Seem like we was jus' in magic city yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles he would say
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
Homie if I could rewind the hands of time
I would have cut of the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangsta I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot wit my own 9
I was 2 beeps away from a flat-line
When you a bad boy niggas don't wanna see you shine
Dre said it's my turn, he called it game time
23"" Lexanis bitches call 'em Lebron's
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Luny back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole k, got shot 1 time
That was a cool nigga I wish he had 9 lives
My brother Devon died 'cause he chased a cat
It's a dog eat dog world Jesus please holla back
I got a confession to make its called payback
If y'all don't wanna listen show me where pastor Ma$e at
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past

I'd give anything jus' to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back
I would have told Big Will it rain every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe you gotta watch where your birds lay
Would have told Vita to stay sober
When niggas beg for mercy, that mean the beef is over
Told Meesh to take the Porsche back, drive a Rover
Told slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I would've change a couple of lines when I wrote soldier
So I wouldn't have to live lookin' over my shoulder
My life is like an impala ridin' 3 wheel motion
I've been front to back, side to side
Level my 6 4 frame out, keep on rollin'
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer
Picture The Source suckin' Benzino's dick
Tryna be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get
You dead when dat green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch you couldn't change that
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back
If I could start my life from scratch

One motherfucker in the projects killin'
The same motherfucker that'll burn down the village
With a chronic blunt full of that you know who gon
Take you back to Compton in that 6-4 two-door
Sub whoofers in the trunk kickin that lethal injection
A hood nigga lost with no direction
So he bought a blacksmith in western strapped on his vest and that's his protection
At the intersection waitin on a rival cause in the city of angels it's all about survival
Fuck the 5-0 they wanna see you D.O.A welcome to L.A.
Where the ghetto birds flying over my auntie's and my cousin house
Tell me what they buzzin 'bout the lil homie got smoked on the corner
And now his momma cryin dead in California
Motherfuckers ain't gon learn till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird light shining through the fuckin' palm trees
California ain't a state it's a army
Motherfuckers ain't gon learn till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird light shining through the fuckin' palm trees
California ain't a state it's a army
Jumped in my impala took a trip to the swap meet
To scoop up ego trippin' and a white tee
Cause some niggas in my old hood don't like me
Time to put they ass in check like my nikes
Shoulda hit my nigga mack 10 on the chirp
All I need is me and my bitch if you scared go to church
Cause them California niggas crack heads for the turf
And life ain't nothin' but tech nines and dirt
Dippin through the jungles my escalade hit a dip fuck
Here come the gorillas in the mist
And they dressed like ice cube was in 96'
Stone cold jehri curls not one drip
I'll sleep with the worms 'fore I swim with the fish
And I'll ride with my niggas 'fore I roll with a bitch
If it don't make dollars it don't make sense
And I almost got shot 'cause I couldn't hit a fence
Motherfuckers ain't gon learn till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird light shining through the fuckin' palm trees
California ain't a state it's a army
Motherfuckers ain't gon learn till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird light shining through the fuckin' palm trees
California ain't a state it's a army
Call the U.S. government and tell 'em it's a motherfuckin code red
Niggas try to straight up jack me now they both dead
Third lil nigga got away on his moped
Caught him round the corner put the beam on his forehead
Jumped in the impala then smashed through the light
Without him one time in sight so I bust a right
Oh century headed to the L.A.X where ain't nothin' but fly bitches and jets
In and out of lanes and I almost wrecked out brand nigga in a 600 throwin' up the set
He must don't know I got the 40 on deck and the tech
Tryna be shabba ranks time to flex thas the third time this shit happened to me all day
Guess it's time to add another dead body to the doorway
So I turned down my spice one tape and hit the switch
Emptied the whole clip in his fuckin' face
Motherfuckers ain't gon learn till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird light shining through the fuckin' palm trees
California ain't a state it's a army
Motherfuckers ain't gon learn till the chronic blunt don't

Casket closed, air tight like Mystikal's cornrows
Expose rap niggas, take hoes from rap niggas

Think I'm bluffin'? Guns cocked, say somethin'
Ain't too many real niggas in this here rap shit
The industry soft when Plies getting slammed and shit

Whoop the white nigga ass, it might pay better
Got my Timbs on the gas in this grey sweater
Tag Coogi, I bet you'd be more cautious if you knew me
Your girl tryna do me, hoochie, groupie
She tryna catch up on a Gucci, baby, no, I'm out like Karrueche
Gave me that BJ so I slid in that Pizookie
And that's why I'm the dookie
You fuck me, I'm fucking your bitch, stupid

A cross style make a jada make a run threw yonkers

So roll over you can die with the jury
First n**** take the stand to testify he gunna die with the jury
And I might kidnap the judge or send a team to lean on you so the D.A budge
I got n****** that'll ride for a grand so handover my rock
Or like earl manson you can die where you stand or you can die with your man
I'll let you jog for about 30 seconds then you gunned down

Take it to a motherfuckin neck
Pull up on a n***** holdin' triggers 'n' tecks

Smoke grass by the pound
Glock holds 17 rounds
And the flow'll knock any n**** down
Rap you like a burrito come threw and kill you and your people
Tell them that I shitted on you n*****
Like I was a flock a seagulls
Infared beam like a traffic jam at night
Handle any man in sight

For any n***** puttin' flamed on a porche
And never drive on
Bitch your gunna die on

Bust shots at the clouds

Flash fuckers on the tip of the gat

So we will bust your head n**** straight through your hand
Or get off in yo ass n**** like jackie chan

Gunnin this motorbike feelin' this power man
185 miles per hour man
I stay cooralatin with the taliban
I show up (show up, show up, show up, show up)
N***** talk about money they forgot the struggle
Try to paint a perfect picture they forgot the hustle
Pieces of a puzzle
Guzzlin pints watchin the moonlight
In the sun light
More gun fights
Penetentary fly three kites
I've seen more pussys turn to mics than mices turn to man
So n***** take the stand get stomped by another man's hand

Got me servin' grams again
Grams rapped in rubber bands

Slow rollin' dro blowin' I'm gettin' rich you see my fro growin' ho's knowin' I pimp them to the fullest

Shit be complicated like out of towners
Trying to understand why we say waddup Blood
But we not related
That's how Compton made it,
So don't run around yelling So Woo without a Chuck Taylor confirmation
On that documentary sh-t I shocked the nation
Muhammad Ali shit like I boxed in Vegas
When it come to beef sh-t, n-gga I'm the greatest
I knew I was next the night they shot Pac in Vegas

And I welcome you to my world you've been cordially invited
Now I got the whole world excited
Know every word when they heard that I write it
Know I can f-ck every girl cause my jewelry the brightest, and my herb is the lightest
Some n-ggas mad I made it, blame it all on perfect timing
I say I made it big 'cause I stuck to the cursive writing
These n-ggas rather be a has-been then not be famous at all
I learned you ain't really gotta be famous to ball
I'm hustling hard, and turning bitches to custumers soon as they get in front of us,
Bad hoes after the shows rushing up
Baby them n-ggas clowns talk down but they look up to us
May look the same but I'm nothing like them suckas

I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
'Cause I play for the Bucks and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin' of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
'Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin' the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
It's Telly and young Game, the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin'
Yale or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet, I'll come back with 10K in the drop
I'll stay in the spot, wearin' a crop and coppin' ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth
And you don't want it when the stainless out
What the game about, the bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggaz can't stop us dawg
So why the fuck you wanna knock us off
Like we some high-powered cowards
And y'all really the niggaz that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack
It's Telly Mac and Game the hustler, you can't change that
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president"

Leave the angels in the city
Tell them muthaf-ckas I'm forever paid
California king wrestle gators in the Everglades
Drive up out that muthaf-ckin swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that Red rag in your pocket I wanna see your f-ckin resume
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole: I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smoking that chronic just to meditate
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another Levee break
You niggas is featherweight, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga wack found me, shit, I was selling weight
Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performing in front of millions, nigga every race
64 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
4th album, no 5 mics? Then let 'em hate
But I'm not stopping till I'm the f-cking king in every state
(Hook: Kendrick Lamar)
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright
'Cause I wrote that shot, I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'mm wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie your knot on a Downtown building, let it tow behind me
Tell 'em they can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
Nigga f-ck your feelings, this is me
I'm sick of muthaf-ckers talking about ""the West died""
Can't you hear my heart beating?
That's the motherf-ckin West side, you test me, you test God
I'm his son, insane songs, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where 2 of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter of fact, shorten your list nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov, prolly Pac, Nas, no particular order
Bet a mil that I slaughter, serve niggas, give a f-ck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly
When I'm the nigga sold 5 mil out the gate and numbers do not lie
I gave you the Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the f-ck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waiting for
I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door
What the f-ck y'all take me for? I love you cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor, walk up on you
Like ""what's going on baby boy?"" Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin
(Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar)
Kendrick, And I wear pendant on my shoulder, soldier
Like a lieutenant, and the coupe tinted got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac in his prime
Thug life is now on radar
Till the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickriding
I'm addicted to Westsiding
Living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
""Compton!"", a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, Never TV screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit, now everybody sing that shit
Red, is a very emotionally intense colour.
It enhances Human metabolism, increases respiration rate and raises blood pressure.
It has a very high visibility, it is why stop signs, stop lights and fire equipments are usually painted red.
It also represents one third of California's gang population.
Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area.
Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle"

What happened in hip hop
That got Pac and Big shot
The thicks plots
Now every rapper claim
He let his clique pop
But even myself tote a gun
And know to run then get shot
I've been there before
Now I'm fuckin' with Doc
(Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers)
If not I push rocks
Anticipatin my encarceration
Media think I'm fakin like Mason
But when it comes to mase
Fuck Off Kelly I don't take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it
I'm putting you under the pavement
No buddhist, priest, catholic, or baptist pastor can save him
I'm far from religious
But I got beliefs, so I put
Cannary yellow diamonds
In my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead
Without a part of my chest
Layed in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years
While everybody else dropped
Now I understand why NAS
Did a song with his pops
I'm ready to die
Without a reasonable doubt
Smoke chronic and hit it
Doggy style before I go out
Until they sign my death certificate
All eyez on me
I'm still at it, illmatic
And that's THE DOCUMENTARY
If I die my niggas, fuck it
I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas
Got a hook from Faith
No verse from Jay
I guess on westside story
He thought I spit in his face
Told Ed Lover and Money Luv
I was talkin' to Ja
With that mayback line
It was payback time
Keep fuckin' with me nigga
Ill put you under me
Take your car and trade it in
For eight 3 hundred C's
If you cross my T
I'll dot your Eyes
You do life in a cemetery
Ill do mine with Shyne
Come home sit in the thrown
With my legs crossed
And my air force
Middle finger up
Fuck the world
'Cause I'm feelin' like Puff
When Life After Death hit
Mo' money, mo' problems
And I lost my best friend
I'm the second dopest nigga
From compton u'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums
Every 7 years (haha)
(Game (Commentator))
(You know what speakin' of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song westside story)
Oh Oh
(You got a line that says
Don't wear throwbacks
Or drive, ride in maybacks,
Is that a shot at Jay?)
Naa, I was talkin' about Ja Rule
Yeah, So, Yeah, I got a lot of
Respect for Jay
You know what I'm saying
I never take shots at legends
That's just something I don't do
(Verse 3 - Game (Busta))
Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'm a son of a gun
Cause moms was a hoover crip
First day I got signed
I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes
(Son, duke is sick)
The prodigee' of Doc Dre.
I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Q gone
They say truth hurts
Sunk, like quick sand
Don't stop me in traffic
And ask about hitman
I gotta restore the feelin'
It crawled from under the rock
After the dog pound
Crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed
I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan
After I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game
And I don't know Dre.
You gonn do me like X-Zibit
And cut half of my face?
I take all the credit
For putting the west
Back on the map
If you ain't feelin' that
Guess I'm Gorilla Black!
I'm ready to die
Without a reasonable doubt
Smoke chronic and hit it
Doggy style before I go out
Until they sign my death certificate

So cover my face, and run up in the place

80 karats on my pinky and rang
Crews buzz when you speakin' my name, 'cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes

The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
The, the, the, the
It be jam-packed in front of the stoops in Siberia
Same way they are in the middle of Nigeria
Every part of the whole world, there's an area
That, if you're poor, another day alive is a miracle
The blocks in Watts got crooked cops that frame the innocent
No different from Flint, Michigan
Living in the D, checking in with the pimps and them
It's similar to O-Town, in the Southern Peninsula
Pretty city, skyscrapers will fool you, look through to
Inner cities the rich won't move to
The nice parts, they well-protected by a vanguard
The opposite of how these concentration camps are
Low-income housing, it dwells murderers
But children don't qualify for health services
The bourgeois act like they don't see starvations
Like they spraying Estée Lauder on sanitation

Streetlights come on, cop cars' lights flicker
They smoke us like cigarettes, need a light, nigga?
Used to chastise or string us up to spite niggas
War to fight for the culture, instead we eaten by vultures
They mix us like mimosas, hang us on wanted posters
Asked for license and registration with they gun out the holster
Some of us guilty, some of us not, some of us filthy rich
Others just watch us niggas drive up the block
We think we keeping it one hundred coming back to the hood
They think we flossin' money, so they pull a ratchet: what's good?
It happens in Compton, happens in Queens, happened to Big L
Happened to Chinx and 2Pac in that passenger's seat
Sometimes it's internal, happens to you before you happen to bleed
What's beef? Cops killing niggas dead in the streets

Throwing threats at each other
Broken bottles and bar fights with box cutters
Alcoholics, narcotics, organized
Families sleep from a gas stove, burned alive
They bagging up drugs with plastic gloves
On his way to the top with his cash, he shrugs
Kidnappers, degenerate thieves and gamblers
Stealing, panhandlers, wrapping grams up
Rubber bands on they Grams, what?
Playing cards and they bored
Members of gangs, living by and dying by the sword
Block parties, fools stamp debit cards

Same clothes and cars, instead we get the same jail bars

Heard my car alarm goin' off on my 6

Pull the blinds down and took one hit of the Endo
You niggas ain't doin' shit, but stealin my neighbors rims so
Walked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over
That's what I'm rolling with...
Nah I ain't saying shit and I ain't snitching on nobody
Yeah that's my .45, but it ain't got no bodies
And 2 dead niggas? Them is nobody...
They should've torched em, then you wouldn't had no bodies

I was at the kitchen table choppin up some shit
Listenin to Jeezy and I heard a little (bullet sound)
So I turned the radio down and cocked my 4-Fif, oh shit...
Am I hit? Nah just a hole in my Jordan fitted
So I turn down all the lights and cock my 4-Fif
Seen some niggas jump in they escalade and that was it
How much longer I gotta stay in this muthafucka?
Let me get a cigarette, I don't even smoke but shit y'all got a nigga stressed
I gotta stay in this muthafucka until I confess?
Shit, y'all bitches better get some rest
'Cause it'll be a cold day in Miami
Before I snitch on myself or the hood, you understand me?
Ya I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy
Niggas run around the hood singin'... They should get a Grammy
And you two muthafuckas should get an Oscar
With this good-cop-bad cop shit... Take me to process

Already told y'all, there was money on the table with the bricks
I was walkin' to the bathroom to take a shit
Then I heard my dogs barkin, there's some noise by the fence
So I ran to my room and reached for the 4 Fif

Looked out the bathroom window and seen two more

Nah nigga it's been a day since I hit you with that purple tape!
Niggas know my style, movin them tracks out
And 
 gunna be worth the wait.
Nah, nigga the earth gonn shake
And Rihanna gonn be hopping outta birthday cakes.
I'mma trim and top it till these little niggas stop it.
Nigga I'm clocking let your G-shock clock it.
Just got a Mazzi, took it to the shop, dropped it!
Slide through the hood, three boss side pocket,
With my side chick and her hair flip like the old sidekick,
The world bumping my shit!
Oh They Think I will Make It Up Here, Right (x2)
Niggaz like 
 that's right.
Matter of fact, to be exact I did it last night. And I can prove it to ya,
The Heat lost to the Nics in Madison Square, nigga I'm like Google to ya.
Watch how I do it to ya, I'm the King started my own gang,
Shit I'm like Harry Hoover to ya.
Nah, matter of fact, Freddie Krueger to ya.
This ain't a dream, I'll really put the rougar to ya.
Scared how that new shit drop, set up shop.
R.E.D. Album gonn drop, them niggas gonn call cotch,
Niggas gonn call cops Chuck Taylor in the building
Can't see the goons, they blend in, like chameleons!
Rolling Stones said I'm brilliant hottest mixtape since Wayne dropped No Ceilings.
Now I ride round the hood with no ceilings,
Everybody in the movies clappin' for the villain!"
204,The Kill,2011,Purp & Patron (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"(La Roux - Sample)
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
(x2)
(The Game)
Let me crack this Patron and talk to you for a minute
Won't you put that blunt down 'fore you put the chronic in it
Before you do that drive by, listen for a second
Why you need a 45 when your mind is a weapon
If you use it like you 'posed to than you could be Malcolm X
Instead of counting body bags, my nigga should be counting checks
Don't be a follower nigga, be a leader
And if that mean's I'll lose you on Twitter than so be it
Had a daughter yesterday, see my baby momma bleeding
Remind me of Keyshia getting shot down while she was feeding
Her baby in the projects, I'm supposed to be proud of Compton
I'm just glad me, Damare and Brandon made it outta Compton
I put on for my city like Jeezy say
Iron out my red rag just for Free Weezy day
And since they did ? like Emmett Till
Crack the Patron seal
(La Roux - Sample)
(The Game)
I can take you back to '03 when ain't nobody know me
My game was regional like the ? Marion, Kobe
Teach me how to Dougie, come here little man, show me
Clutching on his momma leg, remind me of the old me
Ain't trippin' off no old beefs, ain't grinding on my old streets
I'm in the hills smoking on cigars like an old G
Cooley high coochie, Levi's no fleece
Space jam Jordan's killin' 'em without the cold sheets
Rappers say they trappers and these trappers think they rappers
Go listen to Blueprint, your all hustling backwards
Shout out to my reall niggas, Birdman, Styles P
Kiss my nigga Sigel, know them Philly niggas wild b
Snoop you insane 'cause, Bun you a trill one
Nas, we forever since you helped me get a deal son
And my nigga Fab, write his verses like a wheel
He walked out the booth, it's my turn
(La Roux - Sample)
(The Game)
If I ain't never told you nothing, I think you might wanna listen
Leaving Aftermath and G-Unit was never my decision
But I'm back now, when we recorded Back Down
Once friends, now foes, both our phones tapped now
50 was my nigga, but life was funny like that
Eminem played the bandage and Dre was the ice-pack
So I unwrapped the guards, but my scars never healed
Sometimes stars align and some stars never will
Like Ross and Jeezy both y'all my niggas, y'all should chill
Instead of beefin', lets remember how baby blue got killed
How Wolf got shot down, how Meech got locked up
When niggas start beefin' you should give them some Ciroc Puff
And pour me a shot, my own brother want me dead
Worse than that, my nigga Young Buck got raided by the Fed's
So Timbaland, Cool 'n' Dre Just Blaze and Pharrell
Next track I get nigga...

(Fuckin' everywhere
Do you know where to find me, right under that palm tree island)
(Verse 1: Game)
I'm goin', goin'
Take a flight like a motherfuckin' Boeing
Aftermath, and faggot like you ain't knowin'
We stack Bentleys, drive fast cars
And fuck with multiple minages
Livin' the largest, nigga we heartless
How could you blame us?
Crooked cops, they frame us
They mad 'cause I'm more famous than Amos, right?
Taking cookies from these rookies could be dangerous, right?
Salute your motherfucking city of them Angels, right!
That entertain the life, that ain't the life that we livin'
Most of my niggas is better off in prison
Wishin', missing
They fuckin' kids, man, they fuckin' wife, man
The double meaning only caught up with that white man
Turn off the lights, man, put up the lights, man
Let 'em know we still got it for the right price, man
And you could disappear for the right price, man

Well, I'm gone man
They out of Goose, get Patron then
Can't sell it, move it by the zone and
The money talk, only conversate with grown men
The paper real basic, like the birds that get flown in
California hotties, like furniture in my lobby
Where I'm from, don't you know? Nigga, drinkin' ain't a hobby
I'm bi-coastal, nigga don't make me go postal
You know I keep the Glock 9 comfy in my holster
I'm supposed to ride roasters
Sip bottles on Louis coasters
Feed bitch niggas to the vultures
What, you mad 'cause I'm back with the doc?
Money, alongside the yacht
Diamonds inside of my watch, ballin'
We all live playin' poker with this rap shit
Game time chips on the table, you know how I get
Hundred thousand Benz
Million dollar checks
Lookin' on my city, kinda hard when you standin' through the clouds and...
(Bridge: Dre)
Whenever you touchdown in Cali, be prepared
Cause niggas there, might put your life on the line
Put your life on the line
Put your life on the line
Put your life on the line
If you wonderin' where I be
You know where to find me
I'll be right by that ocean
Don't get it twisted
It's the fuckin' pacific
Come and see, I be right by that ocean

I see you done put together one of them tracks mayne
Let me get on down here to the C-P-T
Better known as Compton mayne
Get my young homey The Game, y'knahmean?
Young nigga up outta Compton mayne, y'knahmsayin?
This 2002, we gon' see what it do mayne
Y'knahmean? Yarra
(The Game)
Now everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game
I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton!) Yeah that's the name of my hometown
I'm goin' down, in the town, where my name is all around
A nigga just be hatin' and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doin' nuttin but claimin my city
(Chorus: JT)
Where they actin' a fool, and they carry the tool
Them sick dudes in the streets of Compton
Where I found The Game, he was stackin his change
To maintain in the streets of Compton
Took a trip to the Sco, got low for the dough
In Fillmoe from the streets of Compton
Now we stackin the bread, never run from the feds
They shed treads in the streets of Compton
(The Game)
See my lyrics are double or nothin' provin to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go
Not really into freestylin, or tryin' to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so
That's how I'm livin', I do as I please B
A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets
And everybody know, that you gotta be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton
(The Game)
Nowww Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill dog
Till I found out, the streets get real dog
'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die
'Cause they kicked in the door, and gave the young kid five
They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role
'Cause I lived through fo' five six holes
But I ain't goin' out like no faggot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down
So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker
Ass clucker now you're duckin cause you can't stop a Y.G.
Gangsta, 'cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Game is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin' no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest
A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin to impress
My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest
I'm comin' like this and I'm comin' directly
Cause niggaz gettin' all stirred up, I'm doin' damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone and niggaz can't win
'Cause I'm a gangsta from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N

207,This Way,2011,Purp & Patron (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"Game: Mars
I been looking this way, ever since I remember
And it ain't gone change so I don't care what them people say ay ay ay ay ay
I will forever be this way ay ay ay ay ay ay I will forever be this way!
Hey yo, hey yo,
Keep the game in HD on ESPN while I fuck these lesbians rubbing on they breast and then, and then light up a swisher let it fill my lungs.
Reflecting on the days when I was banging in the slums
From that to number 1, at the grammy's with my gun
Thought I was winning album of the year but then Missy won
Maybe next year, they say I'm underrated I'm under appreciated and its Mr. west here.
I been looking this way, ever since I remember
And it ain't gone change so I don't care what them people say ay ay ay ay ay
I will forever be this way ay ay ay ay ay ay I will forever be this way!
Always stay the same,
Even though I can't write it to change the game
You can never change the game, I'm just trying to make a change,
Stay positive but the negative shit make it easier to make some change.
So? I use to take a chain, so? I use to rob a store
So? I use to load a clip and tell my niggas time to go
Empty the clip and tell 'em hallow tip vamonos.
I know its uncommon to see a gangsta' with a common flow.
I been looking this way, ever since I remember
And it ain't gone change so I don't care what them people say ay ay ay ay ay
I will forever be this way ay ay ay ay ay ay I will forever be this way!
Now as the time flies a rappers albums is getting weak as fuck, I feel like I don't need this bitch feel like I don't need this truck.
Keep your rabbits foot nigga I don't need the luck.
All I need is my niggas a half of Oz. of weed to puff.
Kickin' it with this rat I'm about to beat it up
Thinking about droppin' this tape how y'all gone eat it up
Take my time on you niggas ain't no need to rush
You think you seen it all, nigga you ain't seen enough.
I been looking this way, ever since I remember
And it ain't gone change so I don't care what them people say ay ay ay ay ay
I will forever be this way ay ay ay ay ay ay I will forever be this way!
Nooww... as we prepare for dinner, chop the table in half this side is for the sinners
But I'm forever in limbo parked in this Lambo
Banging this instrumental that I got from Timbo
Wishin' I would of just burned my demo
Wishin' I would have never hopped inside the Doc's limo but I did look at what I did
I'd give everything back except my kids... yeee
I been looking this way, ever since I remember
And it ain't gone change so I don't care what them people say ay ay ay ay ay I will forever be this way ay ay ay ay ay ay I will forever be this way!"
208,Too Much,2006,Doctor's Advocate (2006),Hip Hop,The Game,"I'm from the old hood, something like your hood
Where niggas don't know good or know Sug
But the blow good, so we rock it like Tracy McGrady
Send it to Houston in a grey Mercedes
I'm a product of my environment, grew up in the 80's
So that mean me, Kanyeezy and Young Jeezy all crack babies
And it's evident my flow is heaven-sent
First LP on the same shelf as the veterans
Nigga I can't be fucked like a lesbian
I'm the hip hop, and cartoon is the mexicans (?)
I'm a artist, never claimed to be the hardest
Just number one since B.I.G. and 'Pac departed
Nate ridin' with me, Snoop ridin' with me
All you other niggas used to be good like Ken Griffey
I'm on fire like the tip of a blunt
On fire like a nigga that let it drip for a month
I'm a blood, you can crip if you want
Just let it bump like you got Scott Storch tied up in the trunk
I'm the ice cream truck man
Guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man
Call me the front man
(The Game)
Too much Cris in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk
So let it bump
(Nate Dogg)
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares
Grabbing her by the arm, 'cause she stare
Don't know how much attention you pay
You better be ready to die in this game
I thought I told you I'm done with the beef clown
My son three now
And I been watchin Dre so long I'm makin' beats now
Came on the rebound like Ben Wallace in the D-Town
I mean Chi-town, fuck it, it can go down
Nigga, I spit the whole round like four plus four pounds
This the wild wild west, call it a showdown
I'm Billy the Kid till they split my wig
I come back from the dead tell 'em to kill me again
Put my head on the barrel dare a nigga to shoot me
I'm gansta, took more shots than Tooky (?)
I'm alive, so I'ma take a Patron shot for Tooly (?)
Roll a California blunt and keep watchin a movie
Inspired by this gang banger shit since I was two
I brought the West Coast back, what the fuck you do?
I'm the ice cream truck man
Guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man
Call me the front man
Drive fast, both hands on the dash
Close both of your eyes and hope that you don't crash
This is lyrical homicide, both airbags out
Roll the fuckin' windows down, let the bass out
Niggas, drop the top for whatever you in
Bitches, let your ponytail blow in the wind
Inhale the chronic, blow out dollar signs, nigga
You can drive a Bentley if only in your mind
Four doors, leather and wood
Ride like I got a horse stable under my hood
And I keep a chrome 4-5 under my hood
So if I die, nigga, bury me under my hood
Who had the hottest bitch in the game wearin the chain
Mr H to the Izzo, Nas and Hurricane
Long as my family straight
Read this at my wake
I gave them The Documentary and they scraped the plate
20 magazine covers, nigga, look at his face
I can not, will not, ever be replaced
'Cause I'm the ice cream truck man
Guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man
Call me the front man

Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains

A1 good with the carpet cleaning, they can get the rest of that shit up

Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home
If beef cook then I'm bringin' the chrome

When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big
When I'm rhymin on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin' on the block
And when I'm loadin up them clips, I listen to 'Pac
A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
Than F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey

Hey yo the kid still at it, woke up from that coma
Seen hell came back and here comes my first classic
Still chop it up at the table, still put dope in the bag
And still got dope, under the mattress
It was hustle before rappin', nuttin before that and
12 years old, a lost soul, bumpin ""Illmatic""
Gunshots tried and almost took the young kid's live
Can't do it I been through it the young kid survived
Got the ghetto on my shoulder homey, it's gon' be a long ride
Bear with me, I'ma take you there with me
Show you how the sun shine in one rhyme, no more stormy weather
Streets is mine, we gon' live forever
Get it together 'Pac is watchin, Big is listenin
Eazy is talkin' to us, Big Pun is witnessin
While they souls still glistenin in ghettos from Compton to Brooklyn
The shells cry, every hood's anthem
Where everybody goes to church and prayers are never answered
And they throwin' us curveballs but we Hank Aarons
A picture with no canvas, streets are so skanless
Young'uns jump rope, play ball with fiends and dope handlers
Teenage mothers, deadbeat fathers, no families
Lost and often runaway or live with grandparents
Life stories with no authors, see it through, {?} Robinson's cubicles
When time life is so beautiful
Walk with me we can make it if we try, lost soldiers sometimes
We gotta die but it's okay to cry
Mothers strugglin tryin' to survive, reach out grab my hand
I got'cha, won't let you go for nuttin, I promise
Praises due to Elijah Muhammad, peace be unto Farad Muhammad
Words of Minister Farrakhan
Been true, be loyal, know your roots, water your soil
Stop fightin amongst ourself from birth we royal
Who's king we fightin over a crown, while lifeguards
Watch the hopes and dreams of kids and young teens drown
More infants bein born with AIDS, more parents mournin graves
The plot thickens, somebody show us the way
Tears crackin' the pavement, streets breakin up
The thrill is gone and it's a long walk home
So we might as well start runnin', if it's there gotta take it
'Member Jada said ""We Gon' Make It""
And it shouldn't take 9/11 to bring our minds together
Shit rough we'll grind together
Light a candle we can shine forever or I can pass
So I won't miss Aaliyah's concert in heaven
Live life while we listen to my old heads
So I glow like the memory of Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopez
Through a six-seven Brougham, ride with me through the hood mayne
Where street lights flicker and Chuck Taylors hang
And nobody know they neighbor's name 'less they sell weed or cocaine
A lot of black clouds on a block but no rain
And Game got a lot to say, so they wanna take me down
In my own front yard like Marvin Gaye
Can't do it by myself, people need help
Keep on tryin' to live healthy till the end of my days
And when I die won't lead my daughter astray, lookin' from heaven
Watch my people drive my coffin through the Compton parade
(Verse Two)
I'm in the city where it's strange where killers follow direction
And trail witness protection to get a shot at they brain
Where the babies carry semis and swallow pills for power
Count paper for polly'n, penny-pinch for hours
Take sacks from cowards when the streets is watchin
Tuck guns in trunks cause real G's is boxin
Ain't no other options if you stand on your own two
And if you came to battle you can stand in the phone booth
'Cause we don't wear capes in this part of the land
Cause every youngster from my block has been a part of the plan
I've been trainin since eighty-seven and famous since eighty-nine
Teaching came from the Nation, my spirit is from divine
When I, pass the word through these raps on beats
It's fo'sho' that the Lord gon' make the whole track speak
To the streets, when I pass these beats
It's fo'sho' that the Lord gon' make the whole track speak
To the streets, y'knahmtalkinbout people?
Make the track speak, ""Truth Rap,"" get it right
""Truth Rap"" mayne, for the people, get it right, ""Truth Rap"""

We started throwin' cinthi and decided to chase 'em
Me, him and 50 racin' this rap shit is basic I followed that Jay shit
Thinkin' what I wanna say, step in the booth in one take and
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical LA, NWA shit
The media is bullshit now we can't even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired this black shit this white shit

With a glock that don't phase me,
I'm crazy why you think I'm rhyming with Shady?

And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets

225,White Soft Porn,2011,Purp & Patron (2011),Hip Hop,The Game,"(Intro: Radio Announcer)
We gonna get into this next jam of the week right here. It's called White Soft Porn. You know what I'm talkin' about. I'm the infamous Turbo ?, you dig? And this is WSP radio, where even if you got sloppy walls, you still gettin' balls in your jaws
(Verse 1: Game)
Walk in the liquor store like where the patrón, I need a whole case
Throwin' that Britney take out the Ghostface
You know that white girl go both ways
And you know what I mean if you ever so gay
We can take it from the top like San Jose
Or the bottom of the yacht in St. Tropez
So, pop the rosé, ok, ok
She got a white bronco, call her OJ
She like slow man, she my snow flake
Don't smoke chronic, but she can sniff the whole eighth
Her Columbian. Like Scarface
And we ain't gotta fuck. She all face
She from the valley, somewhere in Cali
My homie Snoop used to fuck with her sister Sally
I pulled over in the alley
She shift my gears and whispered in my ear
(Hook: Mars)
I wanna do it to you. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn
So let me blow your mind. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn
(Verse 2: Asher Roth)
Yea, Ay, Uh
Don't be intimidated
When I put it on you, baby, you be liberated
Ay, We gettin' innovative
This new position that I'm thinkin', let me demonstrate it
Ay, Ain't gotta fornicate
And your performance is important when you use your face
Ay, She never used to be this way
She was a les 'til I went ahead and screwed her straight
Ay, undo your bra with one hand
If anything is gonna care it on and cum can
Cum again, invite 'em if you have any fun friends
I love it when it's girl upon girl with one man
Ay, put your butt on my mustache, fuck that
Won't eat unless your shavin' the muff back, puff pass
Rub 'em from the front to the butt crack
She love it when I play with my tongue, I'm just sayin'
(Hook: Mars)
I wanna do it to you. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn
So let me blow your mind. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn
(Verse 3: Tyga)
Now, now, let's get acquainted
Shots of Cîroc how you let up like Vegas
SL painted
Top back drop take a photo half-naked
Don't be lazy
We on that, everyday a wet dream, baby
Sex on the beach by the leather on the seats
Lookin' for some head, I don't really gotta think
She said you know where I be, Roosevelt suite
Haha. Sunset women like the best
Walkin' at the light like I can change your life
Yea, yea, I rarely see the same girl twice
Let me get her number then I'm fuckin' tonight
Tell her call her friend then we fuckin' tonight
She left that nigga, watch, I'mma do it right
Ain't nothin' to these dollar bills in my high fashion
Champagne glasses pourin' on they asses
So many girls, I ain't never gotta act. Just say
(Hook: Mars)
I wanna do it to you. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn
So let me blow your mind. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn"
226,Who the Illest,2004,Untold Story (2004),Hip Hop,The Game,"Who the illest hub dawg you know
Peelin slugs at your mug
Dealin' drugs in front of the projects
My projects, more scatter, more street
Makin' room for more drama, more hustle, more heat
I can show you how to get, American money easy
It's the gangster, all motherfuckers envy
Leave all semi I tote, clips empty
Foes tempt me, I'm seein no penitentiary
Crime scene clean, shells, no prints
Flee the shootout, X-5, no {?}
It's meant for me to survive this gangster shit
Meant for you not to be livin', food for the pigeons
It's rules I'm givin', new lessons for the street
This jungle I'm from B don't breed no weak
Lames that don't know the game please don't speak
You get killed, want me peeled, I'm showin no {?} nigga
Every nigga out there claimin to be the illest
I don't know if y'all know let a nigga know I'm lost in the stipulations
Niggaz hatin', everybody waitin for the outcome
Whatever happened to just to rappin'?
(Mic graspin, freestyle flow flashin)
(Rippin up tracks and, doin' the thang)
(What'chu niggaz know about Sean T and the Game?)
(Who's the illest?)
(Sean T)
I'm off the rack like slabs of ribs, I want it big
I ain't fuckin' with kids, I'm after six digit things
Fuck the rings and the tribulations, constant playa hatin'
This crimin-al lifestyle, keeps me animatin
Let's turf talk before you niggaz thuggin' it up
It don't matter if you Crip'n, or Blood'n it up
Dallas Squad blooded it up, smashin on sight
But he hoppin on haters like BMX bikes
Fuck around with the Squad see unbearable sights
We takin' gangster shit to the maximum height
But I'm mainly into bubblin, fat grip doublin
Big heads I'm lovin' 'em, you feelin' me y'all
Leavin' the envious in awe 'cause I tremendously ball
I'm supported by the Game so you know I won't fall
I'ma execute my options, keep wettin my paws
And come out unscathed with no scratches or flaws
Who's the illest
(The Game)
They say ""Game, you rappin' like you from the East coast,"" meet toast
Gun jammed in your throat, forgot that you spoke
Game got the streets woke young'n, same nigga got the coke runnin'
Introduce the new fiends to smack
Pops told me when I was younger, you can't live like that
So I don't listen to pops nigga I listen to Kool G. Rap
Went from hustlin sacks to heavy weight, shufflin crack
Kids and preachers know me, young Game the O.G.
Ask the reverand kept the church from fallin', young'uns from starvin
I'm the project like Marcy or the Nickerson Gardens
Comfortable dawg, Compton to Harlem, any city ghetto or hood
Kick back, blowin', listen to Marvin
Get head, count dough and just sit in the apartment
AK in the sofa, I'm the illest, who come closer
To the late ones or great ones fightin over a crown
Get shot off that throne, who the illest now, huh?
(Sean T)
Some say the gangster mentality is dead, imagine that
When fools pullin straps out with infrared
We're livin' in a time of plagues and corrupt life
When homies in the circle end up all trife
Tryin' to shine bright, but lookin' all dim
Meanwhile I stay sharp like a ballpoint pen
I see the smirks and grins but I just laugh
'Cause I'm gettin' lucrative loot, endless math
If you only knew the half of it, you wouldn't hate
But niggaz just pig and talk shit behind Jake
Man you cain't knock the hustle, I ain't fin' to be greedy
I want an exit out the game kinda like Paul Vitti
I'm tryin' to slang CD's in cruise control
Instead of sellin illegal pharmaceuticals
Should I ask for your advice? Like you would know
Fuck it, I'm out to get it, I'm a fool for dough"
227,Why You Hate the Game,2006,Doctor's Advocate (2006),Hip Hop,The Game,"(Nas - Intro)
Y'all know what it is...
The streets named me Illmatic, for that I'm still at it...
Can't hate us...
Fellas...
(Nas - Verse 1)
Vice behind me on the intersection,
Sex and drugs, my anthology on perfection,
Dress superb, admired by conspirers,
Who wanna try me, but ain't high enough to four-five me up,
Child of the eighties, y'all niggas is lazy,
Complain about labour pains, nigga show me the baby,
And my nigga Game, light another L, pass the bottle,
Pro-black, I don't take cotton out of aspirin bottles,
Yeah, I learnt my lessons, and heard y'all snitchin',
Witnessin' you rockin'(?) with Nas, confirmed my suspicion,
Green fatigues on, My niggas I bleed for 'em,
I can show 'em the water, but can't make 'em drink it,
And I can show 'em my fortunes but can't force 'em to think rich,
And still I don't abort 'em (?) when and if they sink quick,
Ignore the ignorance, I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge,
And pray to fans, let Murder Inc. live...
(Marsha- chorus)
(The Game)
I don't talk about my guns, niggaa I just blaze...
(The Game - Verse 2)
'Pac is watchin', Big is listenin',
While Pun talkin' to us, Jam Jay still spinnin',
To every nigga listenin'
I was supposed to be amongst kings, my Mom shouted out at my Christening.
And while you still listenin', Shyne locked in a man hole,
Cam got shot inside his lambo', sample, life is a gamble,
15 years old red rag around my hand, My sisters used to laugh and call me 'Rambo',
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle,
I rekindled the flame,
Dre created The Game,
Niggaa with an attitude from the cloth I came,
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain.
Keep the crown, clown, I rock an LA Dodger Fitted,
I showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down with it,
Now the ball's in my court, never dribble out of bounds with it.
Behind the back to Nas, he alley oop to Jigga, Nigga
(Marsha- chorus)
Me and nasty puffin', this a classic, trust me,
How you gon' pass the dutchie (?) to them niggas that don't love me,
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top,
Same niggas that never wanted to see the Doctor's Advocate drop, flop, I think not,
I'll fuck you rap niggas like virgins,
Dre took my training wheels off his curtains.
I don't need no encore, no claps, no cheers,
The Game ain't over, this the beginning of my career,
The ending of yours, the endin of his,
Like Flavor Flav's clock, I'm back to handle my biz,
Nigga, it's Game Time, that was Dre's favorite line,
Back when proof was in the booth and I recited his lines,
And I still think about my nigga from time to time,
Make me wanna call 50, and let him know what's on my mind,
But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin like that,
He ain't Big, and I ain't Pac, and we just eatin off rap.
One love.
(8 Bars)
I'll do Marsha's bit if you want, but it seems kinda pointless.
I thought Nas was on point with his multis, the cotton line is a bit old though.

Now (what goes around comes around)
I'm puttin' this clique up nigga against all you niggaz
Now get it right
(Verse One: Bluechip)
Hey yo, this is where I see me in this game
Benz Coupe, Maserati, plus I got your bitch all in the Range
And y'all niggaz ain't gon' do shit, soon as your crew spit
My tool spit, metal to your side, watch you lose hips
And I ain't want to take it there but fuck it we can bang
My Cali headbusters'll show you how to throw them things
I'm too connected like John Gotti and Nino
For a small fee they find your body wreakin out in Reno
I know the niggaz that sell weight, and niggaz that stick the niggaz
That sell weight, hammer close behind me like when you tailgate
I know you a snitch, I can see it in your eyes
Shackled up, D.O.C.'s, all my niggaz on that ride
You can, stunt if you wanna, Chip is a gunner
Been reignin/rainin since ninety-six now it's time for the thunder
(Verse Two: Nina B)
In your mind you can blame me but open your mouth and name me
I'm runnin' you out of office you're softer than Bush and Cheney
Go 'head, and try to play me I do you like I was Amy Fisher
Smokin' a Swisher like I wish a bitch would
Listen and use your vision cause livin' in this - hood
And sinnin in your division you think it's all - good
Got niggaz on (Death Row) and it ain't about Suge
Niggaz that stay home they scared to come out shook
Mothers with five kids and all of 'em got took
It's right in these niggaz face, but they just will not look
I'm tired, of the B.S. I'm cheatin' {?} some rejects
Even though we make the best of what little respect, we get
This is the life, that was given to me
A rich-ass bitch that's what I'm fittin to be
Brooklyn to Bangkok I'm beggin to be
And don't nobody write, what I'm spittin' but me
Nina B
(Chorus: JT)
We 'bout to blow this bitch
Niggaz work hard in the game so they notice this, what
We 'bout to blow this bitch
Niggaz work hard in the game so they notice this, what
Underground with it, poppin' collars now
Bust yo' shit nigga, put them guns down
Put yo' knuckles up, catch you slippin dawg
That's how we do it independent now we 'bout to ball
(Verse Three)
For years niggaz sold me dreams that got me gassed
Made me want to get revenge or get the hockey mask
Got beef? Yo the burner's in the lobby stashed
Get your crew if you want, all them niggaz is probably ass
I take the long way, fuck takin' the shortcut
Now we got corporate sponsorships wrappin our tour bus
A quick 32, yo them shits is like warmups
It ain't coincidental in the hood we was born tough
You chump or get chumped, punk or get punked
Save your lil' craps homey, fuck it get drunk
Was one at the top, but now I'm back at the bottom
Most 'em hate to spit with me 'cause when I rap I surprise 'em
Shit is real, that's why I stay strapped with a condom
I keep 31 flavors just like Baskin and Robbins
I'm here now, y'all supposed to be stressed, scared to death
That you gonna be next, record labels, promote the rejects
While starvin artists is closest to sets
And certain niggaz duckin me because they owe me a check
I spit more heat, than a bowl of chili, y'all niggaz know the deally
So turn the music up and roll a Philly
(Verse Four: JT)
Yeah, roll the Philly or Swisher Sweet
And I ain't trippin' while you niggaz just stand on your feet
Figgaro done walked in the building, it's time to expand
Comin' with hundreds of grands and hundreds of plans
You see this Black Wall Street is for the po' broke and hongry
None of my niggaz on the corner never be lonely
Stuck in the gutter mayne, coke packs like Tony
Bricks and pounds of weed half the city owe me
My shipment too big, frontin out the homies
I ain't even trippin' mayne my pockets never lonely
Benjamin Franklins and Grants stick together like
Boys in tough weather makin' noise forever, ah
Yeah mayne, it's real shit nigga and we independent nigga
Fuck what'chu heard dawg, independent is where the money is at nigga
Fuck all your major labels nigga, that's what it is

Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre... nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo

See I'm California certified, my niggas make the murder rise,
Readin my fan mail in jail, Buck told Curtis bye,
So I'mma break it down for them niggas in the South,
Slow it down but this Rolls Phatom grill in my mouth,
