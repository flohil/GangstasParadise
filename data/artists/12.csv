0,30 Hours,2016,The Life of Pablo (2016),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though
But I still drove 30 hours
But still drove 30 hours to you
I remember rapping for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
Till I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job
And I drove back 30 hours
Were remains that long to lose sad
Better unsaid
Always turn, oh
3 Stacks, can you help me out?

1,Addiction,2005,Late Registration (2005),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"You make me smile in my heart, oh
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca-Cola
Then I'm co coming over 'cause it's never over
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca-Cola
And I keep co coming over 'cause it's never over
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)
You make me smile
You make me smile with my heart, oh
Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile with my heart)
I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this uh
Let's say all your friends, remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
OK, OK, OK (You make me smile with my heart, oh)
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me, I mean just, uh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean let it be
I just let it be, I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart, oh)
I mean you, her and me
Maybe, baby, baby
Baby, baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it (You make me smile)"
2,All Falls Down,2004,The College Dropout (2004),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, this the real one baby)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Chi-Town stand up)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we 'gon set this party off right)
Oh when it all
Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a career
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Oh when it all, it all falls down
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down) Oh when it all
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Then I spent four-hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh when it all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down who you gonna call now?)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon)
(And when it falls down) Oh when it all
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We-a buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I want to be on 106 and Park pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
(And when it all falls down who you gonna call now?)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (C'mon, c'mon
(And when it falls down)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Southside, southside, we gon' set this party off right)
I'm telling you all, it all falls down (Westside, westside, we gon' set this party off right)
Oh when it all, it all falls down (Chi-Town, Chi-Town, we gon' show 'em how we get down)
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down (Now Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life)
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
I's can't keep working like this
This grave shift is like a slave shift"

Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know I was waiting on you?
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When you decide to break the rules?
'Cause I just heard some real bad news
People talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you, how long have you known dude?
You played it off and act like he's brand new

Real bad news, real bad news

What people pay paper for damn it, they can't stand it
They want something new, so let's get reacquainted
Became the hood favorite, I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds
We outta here baby
We outta here baby
We outta here baby
Dude, fresh off the plane, konichiwa bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it, spit it then he shit it
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They say, ""He going crazy and we seen this before""
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no Lo-head
'Cause my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MCs, you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MCs, you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm
Uh-uh-hum, and here's another hit, Barry Bonds
Yeah, yeah, we outta here baby
Wha, wha, we outta here baby
Hey Mr. West, we so outta here baby
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby
Yeah, I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fucking good like I'm sleeping with Megan
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops, I meant have them, I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
I'm such a hay-vic, oops I meant havoc
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still cole like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it 'cause I'm so avid
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice and I don't lack shit
And you can get buried, suck my bat bitch
We outta here baby
We outta here baby
We outta here baby
Swag at a hundred and climbin', baby, yeah

7,Big Brother,2007,Graduation (2007),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"E gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel, why don't you wave your hands?
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now I'm on the steeple
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'mma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys, I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like ""Damn, no way""
Translate español, ""No way, Jose""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends
Toomp killed this shit"

Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claim she only wit' me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breakin' up again
We makin' up again
But we don't love no more
I guess we fuckin' then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequilla
And you mix that wit' a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talkin' 'bout her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, muhfucka, yo mama's a bitch
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you
But I'ma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like jigga man

This relationship, it even got me back to drinkin'
Now this Hennessey, is gonna' be the death of me
And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe wit you sexually
'Cause every time that I try you will question me.
Saying, you fuckin' them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affectin' me
You don't see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up
To what you was supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be
And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

10,Blame Game,2010,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Whose fault?
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort, and my first result
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrong
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call her names, names, I hate you more
Let's call her names, names, for sure
On a bathroom wall I wrote, ""I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings, yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two AM and I call back and I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
One AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them ""I like art"" type girls""
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
""Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely"" - Chloe Mitchell
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
No, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing
Oh my God
Baby you done took this shit to another mother fucking level
Now a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this
Goddamn, goddamn
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you goddamn disgusting
My, my God, where'd, where'd you learn that?

Look at you mother fucking butt ass naked

Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level

You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how'd, how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before
I was in there like, ""Oh, shit, I never been here before""
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?
(Yeezy reupholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga, I'mma thank him
I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker, I'mma shoot a bootlegger
That's how good I feel about this nigga, oh
I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted
Even with the bezel? This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in the Source
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in the Source
That's right, that's right, yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?

Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well"

Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert Eag' out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""
(Verse 1: Kanye West)
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?""
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with my y'all

I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like 'oh well, the shoes and the toothpick'
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for free-99
Later on I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
'Cause she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug
She asked ""Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?""
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give ME some head, that'll really piss him off

I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or till I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
""K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""
So say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman

Way down, they'd try to bring me down
We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, ""Yo, no hablo inglés""
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something
Why'd you come then?
I bet only for getting what some get would get ya
What kinda dream we found?
See I'm often at your crossways
Forgetting where the hell I met ya

Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'

This the type of music that you make when you 'round that
Crack music nigga
That real black music nigga

That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music
Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a little somethin' somethin' on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mamas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon' keep baggin' up this here crack music"

And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise, oh

Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons

And the fires did declare us

She putting on her make up, she casually allure

Double headed monster with a mind of its own
Cherry red chariot excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbing up the lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Hater talking never made me mad
Never that not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, they'll export
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the night's over

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?...
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, 'cause
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibrate does
He write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- Its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international asshole
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like ""Pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yeah he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""

Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam
Still, people lose hands, legs, arms for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' 'bout the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' bout Roc-a-fella, my home, my chain
These ain't conflict diamonds, is they Jacob?
Don't lie to me man
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',
How? when I know of the blood diamonds
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless
Till I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold
Spend ya whole life tryin' to get that ice
On a polo rugby it look so nice
How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?
'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause
Throw ya diamonds in the sky

The chain remains, the game is in tact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? [laughs]
Pardon me I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the rock of Gibraltar
I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep,
I sold Kilos of coke, so?
I'm guessin' I can sell CD's
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn!
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy
YG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire
And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere
So he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
He don't even have to write rhymes
The dynasty like my money last 3 lifetimes
Shirley Bassey was in the rear sayin' exactly
What I was sayin' practically me whole career
The diamond is forever, I been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose from the ash like a phoenix
If you waitin' for the end, the dynasty signed
And what seemed like forever is a mighty long time

You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
My homie Marley used to stay 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school for the Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a little somethin', sixteen he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie
Turn your hazard lights of when you see them hoes (Drive slow, homie)
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go (Drive slow, homie)
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
(You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie)
(My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live)
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a little bit (Just a little bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, little homie, drive slow
Yeah, drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

He make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?
(All, all, all that glitters is not gold)
Yeah me we gon' cook this up (all gold is not reality)
(Real is what you live to be)
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why did the guard have to look all through it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter is not gold) my weight in gold (gold is not reality)
Now all I know I know all these things (real is what you live to be)
This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like, ""See, that's my cousin on TV""
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
The second she storm out, then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing
(All the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing, a thing
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter is not gold) my weight in gold (gold is not reality)
Now all I know I know all these things (real is what you live to be)

I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
Till I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I's a loser, I told her, ""Why don't you kill me?""
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow

I'm so shy that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro'

I stole on liver, niggas than you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys

Read the infra-red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper, just an emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'

You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know there's dude's ballin', but yeah that's nice
And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he leave yo' ass for a white girl
 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head get down
 Get down girl, go 'head"
40,Gone,2005,Late Registration (2005),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Wished I had told
Ooh was the only one (Uh oh)
But it's too late
It's too late, he's gone
You sweat her and I ain't talkin' 'bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I ain't talkin' 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way
(Gone) We striving home
(Gone) (I ride on chrome), it's too late
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern
And in turn, I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn?
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin' over babysitters like, ""Bitch it's yo' turn""
""Damn Ye it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""
Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top with Doobie Long
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone
We striving home, gone
(I ride on chrome), gone
We striving home, gone
(Killa, I ride on chrome)
Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer, woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, niggas still doing puff-puff-pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell em
Hey back in a touched up Jag shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell em, ""Too late, he's gone""
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say, ""Too late, he's gone)
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain't even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, shit
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now
We striving home
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons?
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his mama with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on, what could've gone wrong?
Now they asking Cons, ""How long has this gone on?""
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented 
 'cause I'd a-gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times 'cause I'm gone
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind in the 1999
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me, ""Benz or Rover""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got till it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'mma open up a store for aspiring emcees
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone"""

Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mr. By-Himself-He's-So-Impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, motherfucker D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to graduation
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from a eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang
Good morning
Good morning
Good morniying
Good morning
Good morniying, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stoled yo' streetness
After all of that you received this
Good morning
(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)
Every time that we hear them, good morning
(Hustlers, that's if you're still livin', get on down)

I'm not sure anymore-more
Who is knocking at my door-door
All the faces that I know
You make them sunny and new
(Chorus - Mos Def)
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night
(Verse - Kanye West)
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull 'em up outta your dreams
Into real life, if you try to
So close, but so far
And so far, no cigar
We can't dwell on the day PAST all we got is today
So I'mma live like there's no tomorrow
No goodbye
(Chorus - Mos Def)
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night
(Verse - Al Be)
Uh, to you
If I part my art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like everyday new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
My art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like everyday new to you
Stay true to you, a hood musical
(Chorus - Mos Def)
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
So I'll just say good night to you
My people, no goodbyes to you
I'm just gonna say good night

44,Gorgeous,2010,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied till all my niggas get it, get it?
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off a this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip said, ""I got way too many blues for any more bad news""
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway? A fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic and end all of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever who has it?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me forgot about two things, my black balls
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Ayo, I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down"

A muthafucker can't pull you across that muthafuckin' stage Kanye

I'm tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me 
You know what, you's a nigga 
And I don't mean that in no nice way 
Had little kids singin' about the shit, the joke's on you 
You can throw your muthafuckin' hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-fuckin'-body 
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus 
Fucker what you gone do now 
I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody. 
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody. 
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody.

Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours

Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars

And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And gram keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today

Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on
Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life
I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life"
50,Hey Mama,2005,Late Registration (2005),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me.
Hey Mama.
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm gonna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was 3 years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up somethin' that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that Mommy can't you see?
7 years old, I caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheatin' tellin' you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said Mommy I'm a love you so you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'm a get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See your unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you.
Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me.
Hey Mama.
Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me ""Go to school get your doctorate.""
Somethin' to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was gettin' through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me?""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nicky Jovanni, turn 1 page and there's my Mommy
Come on Mommy just dance with me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say ""Hey"" y'all say ""Mama"" now everybody answer me.
Hey Mama, I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama
I know I act a fool but I promise you I'm goin' back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me
And I just want you to be proud of me.
Hey Mama.
I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let your friends know.
Hey Mama.
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'm a get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say ""Hey Mama.""
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
And Let me tell you what I'm about to do, Hey Mama.
You know I love you so and I never let you go
I wrote this song just so you know no matter where you go my love is true.
Hey Mama.
Hey Mama.
Hey Mama.
Hey Mama.
Hey Mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.
My mama mama mama.

52,Hold My Liquor,2013,Yeezus (2013),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
""Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When it's over it's over""
And bitch, I'm back out my coma
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh, I wanna phone home
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
I heard you need a new fad (A new girl)
I heard you need a new stack (A new girl)
I heard you need a new phone (A new girl)
I know your 'rents ain't be home (A new girl)
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh, I wanna phone home"
53,Homecoming,2007,Graduation (2007),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Yeah
And you say Chi-City?
Chi-City, Chi-City
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again (Ow)
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me""
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh
Now I'm coming home again
Maybe we could start again
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you"" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what we tryna do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
I'm in home again
Maybe, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan, oh
Now I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan, oh
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
I'm in home again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
I'm in home again
Maybe we can start again"

Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
'Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch again, same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god

Ahh
Ahh

Ain't no way I'm givin' up

55,I Love Kanye,2016,The Life of Pablo (2016),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called ""I Miss The Old Kanye,"" man that would be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye"
56,I Wonder,2007,Graduation (2007),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about?
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?"
57,I'll Fly Away,2004,The College Dropout (2004),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"One glad morning
When this life is over

To a land where
Joy shall never end

59,Intro,2004,The College Dropout (2004),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wonderin', could you do a little som', somethin' beautiful?
Somethin' that the kids is gon' love when they hear it
That's gon' make them start jumpin' up and down and sharin' candy and stuff
Think you could probably do somethin' for the kids for graduation to sing?"
60,Jesus Walks,2004,The College Dropout (2004),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Yo
We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
And most of all, we at war with ourselves
(Jesus walk) God show me the way because the devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me, with me, with me, with me, with me) Yeah, uh
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone till November, I got packs to move, I hope
(Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down 
(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk) And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong
(Jesus walk with me) I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)
(Jesus walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down 
(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk) And I don't think there's nothing I can do to right my wrong
(Jesus walk with me) I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)
Uh, to the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers (Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare for we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah (Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out
(Jesus walk) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walk with me) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now"
61,Last Call,2004,The College Dropout (2004),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Yo, fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit, motherfucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room 'cause they don't fucking
I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast motherfucker
And I am (Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and (Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the (Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me ten seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
Till the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
Kanye West and Bette Midler:
And I am (Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and (Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the (Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and ooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him, ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye, I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked twenty thousand people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
And I am (Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and (Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas (Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall, all
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie and I was in the session with him
I had my demo with me, you know, like I always do
I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me,"" he's like ""Oh, well okay""
Uh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID
And No ID told him, ""Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""
(Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap)
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
(I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper)
I'm like ""Oh shit""
I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also
People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game
If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here
So you know, after they picked that Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that
I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and be able to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off layaway, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample
I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy, Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called the Dynasty""
And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me
So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time and really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with it sped up, sampled
And now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't be Life""
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album
I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound and you know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management
I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change to try to move up to the next level
And that day, I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude""
(Oh you a real soulful dude, man)
And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio, you know how he do it, one take
And he said, ""Tell me what you think of this""
(Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here)
And I heard it, and I was thinking like, ""Man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z""
I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the in my personal opinion
So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""
(So what you think of this?)
And I was like, ""Man that shit tight""
You know what I'm sayin', man what I'mma tell him?
I was on the train, man, you know
So after that I went back home and man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing
You know, I got groups, I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like, poppin' off the way it should have been
One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed
But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company
So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company
And I got evicted at the same time
So I went down and tracked the beats from him
I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out
So I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk
Me and my mother drove to Newark, New Jersey
(Come on, let's just go)
I hadn't even seen my apartment
I remember I pulled up, I unpacked all my shit
(Kanye, baby, we're here)
You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself
I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City""
And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats
And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time
But then Jay walked in, I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on
I remember it like, like it was yesterday
And Hip Hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him""
So I played ""Heart of the City"" and really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
(No I think Jay gon' like this one right here)
And I played another beat, and I played another beat and I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like, ""Ooh""
Two days later, I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame
Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo, what's up I'm Kanye""
(Yo, you that kid, Kanye?)
""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to beats G""
(Yo, Jay got classics, G)
You know I ain't talkin' shit
I'm like, ""Oh shit""
And all this time, I'm starstruck, man, I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes and they still are, you know
So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days
I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story
The day I did the 'Can't Be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S., he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly
And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people
I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""Yo Jay I could rap""
And I spit this rap that said, uh, ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips""
And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line
But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response, he said, ""Man, that was tight""
(That, that was cool, that was hot)
That was it, you know, I ain't get no deal then, haha
Okay, fast forward
So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single
And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people, my relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper
Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him
Man, yo, I appreciate, I love him for that
And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats
""Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z,"" You know, they dick riders, whatever
So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll
Be like, ""Yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever
Everybody out there listen here, I played them ""Jesus Walks"" and they didn't sign me
You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say ""Naw""
Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels, Jessica Rivera, man
(Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real)
I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up
(Y'all niggas is stupid)
Let's just say I didn't get my deal
The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know?
The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records
He wanted to sign me really bad
(We gonna change the game, buddy)
Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack""
(You gotta make sure it's not wack)
Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and
Dame was in the room
So I played, actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it
So, it's called ""Wow""
""I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow,"" like the chorus went
Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it
So I play that song for him, and he's like, ""Oh shit""
(Oh shit, it's not even wack)
""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot""
(It's actually kinda hot)
Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper
And I'm sure Dame figured, ""Like man, if he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know
So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""Yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""
(You don't wanna catch a brick)
""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on""
I told Hip Hop and Hip Hop was all, ""Oh, word?""
Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H
That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do
Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""Oh he's just a producer rapper"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right
The day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do man, I had picked out clothes
I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go
And they had Mel call me, they said, ""Yo
Capitol pulled on the deal""
(Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal)
And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested
And I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever
I went up
I called G, I said, ""Man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?"

Every morning, every day of my life. I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day. I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he... he's gonna be there for me. Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will. I won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name. Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.
No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there, with his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to.

I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld, I wish love was for sale
Behold the pale horse got me trapped like R. Kell, I bail and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again"

First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start

Seen the rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven

And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me

This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'

Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)
Get up I get (Down), get up I get
Down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of six she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down
Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)
Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)
Get up I get (Down), get up I get (Down)
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out (Take'em to the church)
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down
Get up I get, get up I get
Get up I get, get up I get
Get up I get, get up I get (down)
Who else you know been hot this long (Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong (The Roc is in the building)
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Woo)
Let you tell it man I'm falling, well somebody must have caught him
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums what I got, like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Mary's please Father forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive

Down, down

And this rich nigga racism, that's that ""Come in, please buy more
What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""
Used to only be niggas now everybody playing
Spending everything on Alexander Wang, new slaves

See they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA, teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up, they tryna make new state
See that's that privately owned prison, get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons, bragging 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house, I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse and in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up, I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out, now what the fuck they gon' say now?
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you

Too high again, too high

Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag

Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Captain Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity

Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful

She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep

Never figure out real love

No doubt, everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about

For all the fame and flashing lights?
Do you think I sacrifice a real life

There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
To get my heart, out of this hell and my mind, out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight

It's funny, Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin' for something out there, tryna find something
I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life, to be real?
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, ""Where's my camera?""
For everybody that sees you, to say, ""Sign a autograph""
For everybody that sees you cryin', say, ""You oughta laugh""
You oughta laugh

The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to LA, maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen
And when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left
And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death
Thinkin' the money that the, you spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left for a real boy?

I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some T-shirts?""
Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt? But still
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
They outside of the emergency room, room, you can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon but right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My mama say they say she could pass away anyday
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay, and Aunt Jean
So many aunties we could have an auntie team
Feel like Amerie, it's just one thing when they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high to get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'Cause with my family we know where home is so instead of sending flowers, we're the roses
I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
Oh, Rosie brings the sunshine, oh
I smile when roses comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
I smile when Rosie come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
Oh Rosie brings the sunshine (Say)
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait for the clouds to break
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, say

And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, o to the club with me
And with some Luther Come On and Hope
You finna and stilla be in love with me
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, gonna Be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be
(Well, well, well, well)
She said she wants some Ready For the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton, will definitely set this party off right

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my Brougham

You gots ta roll with the plan

Take it to the dome

Stay up in the zone

And we could get it on
Whisper on the phone

Balding, Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby you're fired, your girlfriend hired
And if you don't mind I'mma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean got damn one time
Let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know, the day that you play me
Will be the same day MTV played videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby I'm magic, ta da
Address me as your highness
High as United, thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited

How should I begin this, I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
Or would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossa's
The Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mill so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer thirty million can't hurt me

Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer the legend I've become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack I just pulled in aces
You looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove leather roof, love war fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose
Them hoes coming in a bakers dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more

Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call

I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had a iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places

Dummy, dammit, not like for me to waste it
The new commandment, thou shall not hate kid
My movement is like the civil rights I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas baby those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April so she chose to march

I got a seven on me, I call my bro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the Pathfinder

I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows) (Me too, I swear I do)
Past the sky (Every night, every night) (Yes, I feel you Ye, I feel you)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again, I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap, look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault, yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in, I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
So I'm on break next to the ""No Smokin'"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin' my hits, writing my hits, writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him so I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle, y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle, you can't fathom my love
Dude, lock yourself in a room doing five beats a day for three summers
That's a Different World like Cree Summer's, I deserve to do these numbers
""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach""
So many records in my basement, I'm just waiting on my spaceship, wow
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
And I didn't even try to work a job, represent the mob at the same time
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind, lost my momma, lost my mind
My life, my love, that's not mine, ""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all, half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball, never one to fall, got to get mine, got to take mine
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime, got to make these haters respect mine
In the mall until twelve when my schedule had said nine
Putting them pants on shelves waiting patiently I ask myself
Where I want to go, where I want to be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holla at Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee, staying low key, nope
Holler at God, ""Man why'd you have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G., police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people counting on me and I'm just trying to find my peace
Should've finished school like my niece then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blow
Aw man, this pressure
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
Man, you know you gon' do it
I remember having to take the dollar cab, coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day trying to make this thing right
And having one of my co-workers say ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I had all that snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn their back on me and didn't want to hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't want to ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off till my spaceship takes off
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly (Heavens knows)
Past the sky (Every night, every night)
I want to fly, I want to fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up and take me, brother, for a ride

I looked in the mirror and half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man, this what I got to say right here, dawg (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory and what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time in the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I, I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
Y'know what I'm saying? (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"" Haha (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
She can't be serious, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
(Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit"

Least about an hour I stand on line, I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance, I just wanted to shine

Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns like, ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane and I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets but when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs but it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm trying to stop lion like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed

So, I represent the first

The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drugdealer priestess
He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name
Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of babes
One for it, one for out the grave
Niggaz want they reperations, How you calculate the amount to be paid
You try to imagine America without the slaves (the slaves)
(Q-Tip)
Her tenament yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold bouillon 'cause she wouldn't protest it
Cause, her bestfriend's man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock
In the hood is a everday happenin'
A friend of the priest say she chewed out the captain
She yelled out ""Why you do this to black men?""
(Common)
I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days
Whether climb or rhyme, I heard of rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
Music, rhymin' good like escalates
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggaz wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinkin' big like Little Wayne in the (?)

C'mon; Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Partiot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now

Who gon' make it better for the thugs and Ps now?

Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats, man
Man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, ""Next summer I'm finna""
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is little Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money till it get sky high

We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say

The second verse is for my dogs workin' nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's and bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move south
Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' till the day we get cake

When you stop the programs for after-school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream, ""Rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards, the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now tell my mama I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money till it get sky high
Kids, sing, kids, sing
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five

What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, ""Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic""
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin' it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cause rappers be deprived, of executive nine to five's

I've seen it, I've seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
My god-sister getting married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I'd wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions, I gotta get with it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
And I, and I can't stop
No, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, I can't stop
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh"
108,Who Will Survive in America,2010,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Us living as we do upside down.
And the new word to have is revolution.
People don't even want to hear the preacher
Spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.
The youngsters who were programmed to continue
Fucking up woke up one night digging
Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.
The signs of Truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal.
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault,
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free doom.
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children and some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?"
109,Wolves,2016,The Life of Pablo (2016),Hip Hop,Kanye West,"Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there
Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
How you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
Got to love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost and found now
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?
Then I said, ""What if Mary was in the club
When she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves""
""What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves""
The rings all ring out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
We found out"
