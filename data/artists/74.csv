Speak the real man
Nigga, speak the real
Speak the real
Speak the real
Speak the real
Speak the real
It's a quarter after nine on my AM, FM
Radio Shack, digital motel, six o' clock alarm reads
""40, get your ass up, time to hit the grind
You can't afford to pass no money, I know you heard about that""
What, what? ""Task raided Millersville, Ms. Miller had a heart attack""
Dude, that's some cold shit, ain't it huh?
I know, she was a good person for certain I know
V-Town, California, where I was born, raised and grown
And since 1979, I been a hustler on the go
You know the drill, my mission for real, a mealticket
You feel, we slowly but surely approachin' seven digits
Figurines, sticky doo hicky and Angel Dust
Mescaline, niggas know better than fuck with us
I'm pimped out flossin' in Reno in the casino
Big bid, fuckin' off feddie, I could've put down on a crib
I does that, I do, rejuvenate, redeem
Take a lose, take a lose don't make a scene
Nigga charge it to the triple beam, fuck the stress
I let that orange box of baking soda do the rest
Holler at my neighborhood chef, Raul
Known for cloning chickens and turning one into two
That's what he do for a living, that's all he's used to
Playtex rubber dish washing gloves and residue, biotch
Bullshit ain't nothin'
You see we gone keep this thuggin'
And mean muggin', jump until it's a done deal
You see E-40 and Sick Wid, it bring the real, nothin' but
What if I bring this back down?
Which one, which one cap'n?
You got to be about it or be without it
Be about it or without it, ay, you know what?
I smell you on that playboy, look
We fin to run down a whole tac on these bitch ass, niggaz
Niggas ain't smellin' this shit, we do this shit
Last night I slapped a bitch upside her dome with my faulty phone
That Heifer's tired she tried to slash my tire
Caught me in the bed with her cousin Tanji
From the track she use to hold my sack
I use to dick her down
Way back in eighty-six she use to look just like a sketch
But now that bitch got a ass, tits, body and boy, that bitch is bad
For what it's worth, the pussy smelled like Certs
Victoria's Secret
Now folks, just remember, I never said I thought about lickin' pussy
I said I never thought about eatin' it
Keepin' it and treatin' it nice
Fuck that, I'm a hog
I put it down, I'm from the hood
Where I live on the outskirts of town on the tuck in the cut
In some empty apartments, man
I'm a baller so you know I ain't got shit in my name
I'm strictly ghetto celebrity, niggaz get buried
Ready for combat if you plottin' and plannin'
Oh if you come for me and confiscate my dough
Let the buzzer be the bail
But my suggestion is to stay within your envelope
I'm block to block, swingin' on vines
Community service, put up stop signs
Uh, hold the fuck on
Did you or did you not tell these niggaz to stay within they envelope?
Shit, these toddlers is green to the game
They ain't know nothin' about these tramps
Six bedroom flats and gettin' dealt
And held a hand across the mat
You see we from the Yay, where we control they minds
And put these hoes on the grind
Ain't got to but I still touch it
Went to 7-Eleven, picked up a traders book
And bought a bucket
Use to have a perm taller than the Charlotte Hornets
But I had to cut that bitch off 'cause see your partna had warrant
That I ain't even handled yet, although I'm havin' cake
The little homie from the hood, want me to put out his tape
He kinda tight too, remind me of The Click crew
'Cause they was spittin' that old high powered
Godzilla ballin' guru, ass type shit you can relate to
Wake to, 'scape to when it's sunny
Ride by, slide by, get at a honey
I know these streets like I know my dick
I can tell you who the nigga is that's about to get jacked
And the nigga that pulled the lick
I got this bitch on lock
999,999 plus a dollar in a safe deposit box
Marijuana crops still in this roster
Kilogram, coca leaf and morphine
What about my niggas in the 415?
Look what they made
My niggaz in the city
They call it made
Top grade regeneration, uncut
Designer weed, straight hempilation, what the fuck?
Sheit, sheit, sheit sheit, sheit sheit, sheit
999,999 plus a dollar, plus a dollar man
Plus a dollar, plus a dollar, man, equals a mealticket bitch
Biotch, sheit, sheit, fuck it"

Motherfucker ?? grew up on the undertuckamajig
My destination control the block
Fast ass wad full of ones in my pocket
With a hundred dollar bill wrapped on top
Thirty-two shot extended clip to keep it trill when I pop
Durin the summer it's Zenith's but in the winter ride stock
Better believe us don't try to play us for false
'Cause it's not a game no way no how
Bullet Loco, Charlie Hustle and Major Payne nigga now
How you think peons try'na deallllllllll with it?
Fuck around and wind up gettin' killllllllled with it
Beotch! New booty rappers get penalized, and expedited
'Cause they don't think about they shit, before they write it
We don't sell narcotics with the po-po problems, playboy take a look
We off into real estate, CD's, millions of books
Used to be crooks still hang around crooks, dealers and ex-cons
Niggaz with Lucci from slangin that alcohol and shermon
Players with cake, pushin they weight, try to find the last trap
Transfer they bloody bread to llegal corporate scratch
What they want?
(C-Bo)
Are y'all fools ready for dis? It's for loco for sure I'll blast
With Bullet Loco and 40-Water we take your life then we haul ass
Tall cash stacked in the basement
Can't leave the house with less than a zip an a extra clip
Niggaz wanna know why I get down like this ain't that a bitch?
You see my, life on TV 'cause it's the daddy with the ?? and a P
Niggaz just can't seem to get away from PD while they surrounded me
And houndin me 'cause I ball hard, on parole in a double-R
Fifty to a hundred G's and je-wels on wrists
Nigga we ghetto stars
Shit my niggaz spent G's and push drop Bentleys
Remi Mark sippin, Cristal, X-O Hennesey
And better believe if we enemies we spray ya wit these
Every night at twelve have your whole motherfuckin city prayin' on knees
And still 40-Water pass the strap and I blast, Jayo hit the gas
Had to tear his whole motherfuckin head off tryin' to get to his stash
Every man they all man, quick to pull a lick out the Brougham
Only reason I rode down on that bitch ass nigga, is because I can!"

Sheets for curtains, socks for washtowels

Way I was raised we had to knuckle up and throw them thangs
We got 'em up and you know I had to check 'em swell
'Cause if I ran home and didn't fight back my mom'd beat that tail
Just received word from my folks upstate
They said uh, they tryin' ta, they tryin' ta take away our weights
And uh, no more beef and pork just muslim books and fish fork
And laps around the yard with my Walkman bumpin this
Now I'm bouts ta get married, is it clever
Thought it was, till I got the Dear John letter
Been down for ten bucks and got a eight year stay
And I just found out she had her baby yesterday
Ain't nobody been to see me yet, but I ain't gonna worry
Man ya out there ballin main can you drop a twenty up in my commisary
Uh, my family thinks that I'm a thug homie
When you see my momma man give her a hug for me
And tell her
Verse Three:
Huh, thinkin' back, you gotta watch your back and play it well
Enjoyed myself when I was out there tryin' ta get in that mail
We used to kick it at the waterfront the whole Vallejo
Watchin the pervin contestses between E-40 and Del
That's what we did up under the bridge fools posted up
Choppin game conversatin gettin' toast up
Leanin against my seamless convertible tops and boosted cleaners
Them Click boys mobbin deep in cuts, actin' meanest
The good times, they gone, here in the can is my new phone
Guess in order to do some right I had to do some wrong
Picked up a package yesterday and I was HAPPY
It was a box and full of goodies from my PAPPY
Tripped me out ain't seen or heard from Poppa Duke in years
Sent me a picture and some fetti dang they sheadin tears
See first you born then you live then you die

Been in the game for 20 years and I'm 40 years though?
6 A cougar, 40 years cold
40 ounce of brew, 40 this, 40 that
40 at the crap table shooting 40 stacks
40 thousands fans, 40 niggas on stage
I heard 40's 40 but 40 don't act his age
40 stay relevant, 40 ain't never played
40 ain't a punk, 40 will pull the gage
40 years change with the hawk sitting on her
40 ain't left the hood, 40 around the corner
40 like to drink, 40 be getting drunk

Water with the baking soda whipping up kids
It's a drought without water, the soil can't crack
Water in the duals makes loud glass packs
My family know me by Earl but water my handle
All the gooing in the club, drinking water like a camel
Put some paint where it ain't, water based paint
If you don't drink no water, my ninja, you might faint
Water be everywhere but water from the V
Water be limping like he got water in his knee
Water pour, water simmer, water heat

Y'all be looking for a walk, I be swing for the fence
Under pressure, never tense, rhyming is a synch
Change the rap game when they let me up off the bench
Back with that 91 super Atlantic flow
I've done seen your favorite rappers come and go
I done seen a lot of blow, a lot of snow
I done seen my homie grandma get beat by the po-po
In the hill side of Vallejo, County of Selano
Get off a magazine and meet me over there by McDonald's
That's why I used to get my yola stacks off
Back then I was small time, all I had was rocks
Manage with it, a fixture on the streets

Might not know how to read and right, but I do know Arm and Hammer
If the screen from a tweaker's pipe turns black, that means it's bamma
If it's too many seeds in your weed, then chop 'em down
If your bud gets bogus, then run his ass out of town
I'm on the Carquinez Bridge, terminal three, quarter after seven
Pockets full of hundreds, can't seem to find no one's, engine revvin
Smebbin, talkin' hella shit to the cashier
Pi-pi's get right behind me askin me how much I been had to drink
And I said, ""A beer""
Blitzed, out of my wits, drivin' drunk
Let's see I done hit one, two, three ain't no tellin' how many skunk
In and out of the holdin' cell, blood alcohol like a warrior
And I refuse to answer any questions without the advisory of my lawyer
(B-Legit)
I been in it, all around it, co-founded
Did it when I done it, I musta been blunted
Ninety-six hundred for the two P's
I let the homie K-One run through these
Places that I roam I let the hubs alone
I wonder if they're trippin' at Nextel phones
A bad motherfucker for the butter 'n' grits
And you niggaz need to know this shit

One beeper on my side gotta be in the house by eight o'clock
Organized crime bitch, all the time bitch
Get off his dick and get on mine bitch

Poppin' them generic brand Golden Seals
Parole can't hold me, and neither could y'all
Bitch me and my Click is off the wall

I fucks with everybody to somebody, major factors
To niggaz if you can't understand this shit

Now the parties don't start until we walk in
Drunk off that gin, down to check yo' chin
I'm a mannish motherfucker with the chips and bread
And enough, to have your head kind of tough
Bluffin don't exist, we pull the whole cards
Tail between the legs when you walk in the yard
So if you hard, and wanna stay that way
You better watch what the fuck you play
(E-40)
Check it out
It's bring yo' own bottle, 'cause I be likin
To get to perkin somethin' awful
And compute that motherfucker slurrin
Talkin' crazy to bitches, weeble-wobblin
Burpin, gurgin, stomach growlin off the hinges
Lurkin, torqin my stay highs with Red Ledges
I'm tryin' to get that fast quarter, fuck a slow nickel
Run a smooth ass operation without gettin' caught in the pickle
Take my cool ass on a vacation that maybe someday stop
Buy me an empty commercial lot
And turn it into a car wax wash and detail shop

When a motherfucker walk up in the club, I mean I mean

But if a nigga let his motherfuckin scrotum hang over his shoulder
And come up and do a WALK-BY on your bitch-ass
It's nay-thun
Don't give a fuck about how much money you got nigga
It's about how you outsmart the next nigga
(Chorus: Lil Jon)
Bitch, nigga, what the fuck's up!
(Anybody can get it!)
Hoe, niggaz, go pull your skirts up
Don't think that you won't get touched, BITCH!
I'm in your grill now, nigga what you gon' do?
I'm in your grill now, bitch what you gon' do?

Y'all niggaz don't want a fight, all y'all want is a hug
Your bark is worse than your bite, with your mean mug
Let's take it to the grass and we'll see what's up
Y'all knows about me, Mr. Streetsweep
Twinkie soft niggaz get dealt with swift-ily
I'm amazin; I always bring the heat
Pull the cake up through the ground if he fuckin' with me
Me and E-Fonzarelli, new Starsky and Hutch
Motherfucker don't act like you can't get touched
Grindin niggaz bows up and we turn 'em to dust
As the crowd go ah-Ooh-Ah cause you know you fucked up
They don't wanna see me, nicknamed the realest
Don't believe me, ask them Adamsvillers
This A-T-L nigga!
(E-40)
I sit at the bar and tear up hundred dollar bills
My car, my Hummer got 26 inch rims
I'm a star on my side of the earth, I bleed the block
Promethazine, codeine, water and hubba rock
Million dollar dreams and fiends and things of that nature
Triple beams and things and T-Mobile paint ya
Told myself - I need to stop pushin hop
I need to stop pushin hop so I can buy a WingStop
My young hyenas be bustin' guns, mashin and pistol packin
Smokin' so much 'dro that our lungs feel like they collapsin
Trick I see you and yo' partners laughin'
Jaw-jackin and scammin and plottin
Old soft-ass, medicated, cotton-ass nigga
You're out of line I told you once befo' it's dubya dot
Bust a Head dot com, on mine, hit the flo'!
And don't come back no mo' no mo' no mo' no mo'
Motherfucker it's E-4-oh from the Valle-jo
Still rappin' like I'm po' - BEOTCH!
(David Banner)
I'ma kill a motherfucker's ass if I have to
But is it worth it is the question that I ask you
To blast your punk-ass
And is you bleedin, only to give Satan a damn good
Reason to play with me, look bitch I'm sayin'
You don't listen 'less that tec-9 sprayin yo' ass
Glass breakin in your home boy, thinkin' you fast
I never mash out, till the iron smack up yo' body
Then you pass out, I pray to God for peace
I done best to get my black ass out of these streets
But y'all don't listen 'less I'm cussin and bustin' the shit
You keep beggin, and I'ma give it to ya you bitch!
In your face, your back, your chest, neck and lungs
You want war, you will get it for Mr. Crawfordson
They call me really really doe, ain't no hoe in my blood
A couple slugs bitch you thugs'll give me a hug
Real gangster niggaz raise up
Y'all sticky ooh-wee niggaz blaze up
Or get yo' ass sprayed up, bitch nigga!

It's real out here 40 (It's real Pee!)

I'm out here in the slums where thugs be usin', ghetto tactics
Like, choppin up candy canes
Sittin' on top of a dried up JCPenney day mattress
Whatever it takes to survive, see that's what I supply
Like slippin and slidin in the grocery store
And settling out of court
Soft white coke a black turn into hard solidses
Thirty-eight snub nosed pistol grip lay nijjas on they wah-wah
The saga continues, the struggle's just beginnin
And it's hard to look up to snotty folks, cause THEY be sinnin
'Pac gone, Biggie gone, Seagram gone -- and we also lost Eazy-E
One of the first gangster rappers of all time
To the most vicious and deadliest disease in history since cancer
To Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, tombstone
From the graveyard shift, RBL's Mister C
One love, to Rappin' Ron and Plann B

Everything must change, it's gettin' shady
Got our backs against the wall

UNGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH, I shed tears for pain 40, some for anger
Seen bloodshed by crooked cops, and gangbangers
Feel my pain (unnnggghhh) only time'll change it
And fast money, cars, and bitches got me trapped in this game
And my lil' homies ballin, picture me fallin'
And momma in the funeral screamin and crawlin
Is there a heaven or hell?
To ghetto kids in the anky only time will tell
And jealousy, and envy, come with money
While crooked, politicians, run the country
And it's a, damn shame to see my, weeples vanish
Now they teach us ebonics, what about English and Spanish
I couldn't, live my life behind bars and gates
While the government play a game called process to eliminate

Case #246, shootin in an inhabited area
They was steady complainin about the dope sellin
But they ain't never been evicted, or convicted
They ain't never been subpeonaed to court, or arrested
Shackled like an animal for pushin rocks
Dang near choked to death by motorcycle cops
Pepper sprayed and laughed at like that shit was funny
Pregnant breezy threw down on her tummy
Do you ever think I'll ever be able to get
A chance to repent and ask the lord for forgiveness
Before he close the casket, will my son end up growin' up
Without a father will he end up bein a bastard?
A bastard -- that's a good question (unggggggggghhhh!)

Leap like a frog if you feel froggish, nigga leap
Like to neglect my dogs, starve 'em, sometimes they don't eat
Elroys questioning me about my triple beam - officer, I got proof!

Run with a whole bunch of rugged-ass rowdy knuckleheads - know what I mean
Big niggas - the size of a football team

I'm sick of motherfuckers bitin 40 lingo
Everytime I see yo' bitch ass you got a jingle
And you ain't wrote shit, got it from my people

From California bloods, and Calfironia 'cause

In the town like you might see on shoppin' carts

Constantly fartin, but I'm really supposed to be, shittin on fools

Smokin' burners (burners)
Finger on my thumper (thumper) in this concrete habitat
Never know when you just might have to, put a head on flat
(Ice Cube)
Our status, is penthouses, yo' ass, is rent houses
We got, ten houses, can't even, spend ours
We go, invent ours, in about, ten hours
Comin' with that mob-ass shit, it's a hit bitch
Broke bitch, turn into a rich bitch
Every trick bitch wanna be a legit bitch
We got big ol', big gold gates
We got big ol', big gold, nickel plates (who is it?)
(Ice Cube)
Let me tell you, broke niggaz can't offend me
Evidently, yo' Bentley musta said ""rent me""
I see you rollin', lookin' stolen, L.A.P.D.
Is actin' just like me, they can't believe what they see
Pull you over, it's over, nigga, can't be sober
Rollin' through this neighborhood fool nice to know ya
Fakin like you got the bacon, with that tickin-ass Rolex
A nigga blast till the soul reflects

Block cleaners, poppin' out of my Ford Excursion truck
With heaters, poppin' at all of my enemies better duck

Showcasin and collarpoppin, campaignin like the president
C-notes, hundred dollar bills
Playaz wit bread ridin' houses on wheels
Jewels sparklin glistenin gleamin flossy crystal clear
Baguettes -- hangin' from my fist like a chandelier
Felines holler, scream, ""Ooh he got the BUMP!
Soundin like Godzilla tryin' to get up out the TRUNK!""
Jealous mark fuckin' suckers wanna battle -- that ain't sharp

Po-Po billy club us 'cause they think that we sell dope

Thugs, timers that own barbershops, tow trucks, and clubs
Homies, that open up they liquor stores on Sunday
For me, bo-nitch, BOOTCH
Hood trojan's boss, players from the sticks
Pocket stuffin, some of the homies hustlin
Some of my playaz are pimps, some of the homies strugglin
But none of my folks are simps, marks, nothin' of that there magnitude
Saps, sarches got me twisted, what ch'all do? BEOTCH, BEOTCH!
Big ballin' with my homies!

Tryin' to ride in first class and them haters wanna TRIP
'Cause I never liked a sucker, who beat up on they broad
If you're lackin on your mackin then she's rollin' with the squad
Mossie to the house party, girlies come in twos
No conversation needed, automatic pick and choose
Talkin' up under your brisneath, hot air?
Comin' off like you some sort of hellafied ass ninja - but youse a square

When I used to quarterback that yolla
Perm down to my shoulders trying to get it while it's good

But you can ask your daddy and uncle about E-feazible
They'll say he the gospel, he a for real fisher
He used to cop from me, now I cop from that nigga
Had to share the same bath water with my brother
Used to argue, fuss and fight over pillows and covers
The low man at the bottom of the totem pole
Used to go the Salvation Army for school clothes

I was just tellin' one my dudes
They threw the old rules out the window
Created they own new set of rules

Try to nip it at the bud before it get too outta hand
Before what?
I got some real ones in the pen

Up in there programming
What they making?
Making diamonds outta soap
Just got my car up out the shop
What you got in it?
Retarded knock
Use the loot that I won at a crap game
And painted it butterscotch
You can hear me throbbing up the block from miles away
My neighbor loose it
Po-po's pull me over at least 3 times a day for my music
My over head $60,000 a month total
What else?
Conducting business on my sidekick T-mobile

Gold around his muthafuckin house, gold around his muthafuckin pet

Y'all really want to know who the man behind the fat sack well lookie here
Sho nuf ain't bootsee boss and that's for sure

The ones you least expect you know them square ass niggas in your city
They be the ones who have a grip, they be the ones who be sittin' pretty
Instead of tryin' to be super to start a fuckin' track man
What a nigga really need to do is sit back and straight stack man
'Cause I've been on this Earth for 3 and some odd months man
Trippin' off how these niggas out here be straight transforming
Laughing and smiling, loving and hugging a brother grinning

Ain't neva been pass four blocks in they li-a-life
Dudes can't even dream a dream about gettin' paid
Just sittin' on the corner sittin' there for about a decade
I might not be the sharpest tool in the shed but I'm a rebel
Some cats'll bury their self alive
Just to prove they know how to use a shovel
And about you sounding like everybody else ass rappers knock my flow
But in the back of your head you really be sayin'

But always end up sparkin antennas on bus benches
Watchu know, whatchu say, what's the sco'?
Is it a go? Then you with me after the show
You smell? We hit the hotel, and knock boots
Taught me some thangs, like who? Like Dr. Ruth
Hey! (hey!) hoe! (hoe!)
All up in the kitchen on the flo', feel the mantra
Chorus: repeat 2X {sung}
Do what you do good, cause you know what you know good
Do what you do good, cause you know what you know good
(Do what you know good)

Uh, rappers sport my style like they sport clothes
Then have the nerve to say they made it up, now that's some hoes
That ain't no stickin to the rules and regulationship
That ain't no man if he can't admit he grew up on The Click
On the East they got hot dogs and pretzel stands
On the West they got tacos and burrito vans
In the South, it's (??) and briscuit
What about the Midwest? The midwest, dey just love to kick it!
Top shelf, ghetto tycoon the area sponsor
Can't be seen, like Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster
Dialin for dollars paper route and money counters
Scrilla scratchin paper chasin poppin' collars
(Singer)
Do what I know good
I kick it in the hood real good
Smoke real fat big blunts
Sticky-ickies to the lil' krunks
Thirty-one double-eight-seven, that's nine-eleven
Act like you're livin'
(E-40)
I ain't no Captain
At the bar, signin autographs on napkins
Ball till we have it all - bartender talkin' about
""Last call for alcohol!""
I'm bout to get to, mashin on that (??)
If we don't get no mo' (??) throw glasses at that Moesha fag
And I'm walkin' up out the do', step stuck and stutterin
Didn't even screw up and hit the floor
If I woulda fell, it woulda been embarrassing
Full of that there liquor, walked into a closet
But I'm a king size nigga, baby pull my coattail! And just..."

Lieutenants get the kicks, backwoods of the Yay,
Soldiers leave the place, so the cream I keep,
Six or seven g's every time I beep,
Hit the streets like I can't, plot fo the bank,
Fuck wit a boss, 'cause a pit got rank,
Make yo body stank, leave you lost in the woods,
A nigga from the hood, up to no damn good,
We ride Fleetwood, hit 'em dummied out,
Walk a clerk to the safe, an get the money out,
I'm on a money route, and all cash I claim
A nigga deep in this muthafuckin game.

'Cause during the drought season niggaz be lookin' for a reason to rush ya
So I suggest you put up your bootsees man and pull out your buckets

Now bag it, I gots Ice Cream Candy
And all kinds of things of that flavor
And maybe later I might be willing to go low as long as you buyer before
'Cause I'm the only muthafucka with A-1 Yola,

Dear God, can you forgive me? My future's lookin' sick
I'm in my rag hittin switches I'm suspicious of these bitches
I keep on, calllin, but ain't nobody pickin' up
I think she's stallin, this evil bitch is tryin' ta set me up
Came all alone if it's on then it's on
Where's my motherfuckin chrome, only jealous niggaz roam
It's a war zone (war zone) but I'm a man so with gun in hand
I'm on my way to see this hoe you know the fuckin' plan
Can't understand, but the things ain't the same
You could die over these bitches if you slippin in the game
Niggaz gang bang, but bitches gang bang too
Give up that good thang, and put that pistol to your brain
If you a smart figure, don't have no love in your heart nigga
Any complications pull the trigger, dusted and disgusted
Bitches can't be trusted, you know the rules
They underhanded, she planned it, you fuckin' fool
(These hoes out here tryin' to hold a nigga's heart
So a nigga get his money fucked with
Almost in-laws)
Hey be proud of it when you turn these bitches upside down
What's gonna happen
(Uh, three and a half dollars or probably fo' if
A bitch ridin')
(Yeah main, them hoes talented
They be fuckin' with mo' MC's at Jack the Rapper)
(Aight fuck it, what you say Mall?
Ay, fuck them sheisty ass bootches, nigga)
(Mac Mall)
The California lifestyle that I live
Where the bitches is crooked and niggaz jus don't give
A flyin fuck, so I stay stuck, smokin' on the tay-low
Bay Area playa, tryin' ta have shit major
And a bitch won't save ya
So I ain't playin' Captain Save-a-Hoe
I mob up in ya like a pro and then I'm gone
I'm like Sylvester Stallone, everyday is like a Cliffhanger
Action packed, I let the mini-mac smack that ass
(Spice 1)
Them hoes jacked that ass
Nigga woulda got smokin' on that hash
Can't have my cash, better go and take your nigga stash
'Cause he's a busta, niggaz with clusters
Slippin in shit, betta jack that nigga 'fore I jack his ass bitch
Never was no love for the mark-ass, the lo pink (the lo pink)
You love them Bootsy bitches, can't let them pussy bitches
(E-40)
Gank that ass, betta hide your cash and check her fast
Pump your brakes nigga, slow your roll don't go too fast
Cause bulletproof ain't doin' no good no mo' no mo' no mo' no mo'
Now, niggaz comin' up dead with they brains blew out on the fuckin' floor
Damn, hollow points to flesh tears through the teflon vest
Now r-uh-rest
Pull a plug on a flatline over those, one nigga less
One nigga less, from coast to coast, to the East to the West
Crushin the flesh, dem bitches played a game of death
Look over your shoulder watch your back don't even trust it
I'm tryin' to told ya end up dusted"

Light a sucker up, fried buster like Chimichanga
Somebody come scoop his ass, call a coroner
I guess that's the way we bread
Chemical babies mislead
It's spooky out here in the Yay
These goblins will get on your head
These thundacat's management ain't scared to be deceased
They always cover up they ears
When I'm yelling and hollering out peace
They going through it, they cranky
Stressed out and tense
They starving, they hungry
They eating soup with chopsticks
Plus it's a shortage on purple
And it's a drought on them bricks

Before most of you marshmallows knew want to do with it
Pushing them zones, serving that drome
Balling like I play hoop with it
Never at home, always be gone
Doing a show on the verse split
Let it be known, I tote my chrome
Refuse to get caught loose with it
Looking down at my shoe with it, I'mma real baboon with it
40 over there slipping, he snoozing, he ain't wake
He looking like a plate, he chipped up and draped
You fuck niggas got me fucked up, nigga, I'm a shooter
Think about the consequences, nigga, I got gouda
And niggas with gouda will send a nigga, fuck a case
'Cause niggas with gouda will have your whole family erased
But that ain't something I endorse
I only wore it by force
I'm trying to teach the youth to be loyal and play sports
Instead of in and out of court
And back and forth to prison, utilize they skills
And stay up out the system

46,Extra Mannish,1993,Federal (1993),Hip Hop,E-40,"(E-40)
I'm a little mannish muthafucka
I take after my older brother
Started off selling marijuana but now I'm selling yola
Shit was gettin' hella funky at first
When a nigga was stealin a bitches purse
Ended up gettin' kicked out of every Vallejo school
They clocked me like a circus
I was the little mannish motherfucker showing off in the back of the church
My momma was quick to hit me with a switch and I say ""that hurts""
Get to the house, go to my room and talk some trash
I never believed a hard head made a soft ass
'Cause I be moving fast and I'd be tryin' to stash
Beat up the pizza man and then I straight dashed
Disobidient sport cut my days short
My momma got tired of takin' my ass back and forth ta court
I said ""momma I'ma straighten up for you and I promise I won't warrant""
Got me a job as a paper boy
21 dollars a month
5 o'clock in the morning
Damn I'm slavin' for the fucking white man
21 dollars might buy me some ??(poor carpet chicken george)
I'm tired of muthafuckas fuckin' over me
How can I find a way to make some real money?
But you don't feel me
I was tired of being broke lookin' coked down
Came up off a twenty dollar put me down
Next thing you know I was up to about a quarter of a ki' rollin'
Niggaz was trippin' off me 'cause I was a young muthafucka ballin'
Gettin' my fetti on but when there was funk I had to starve
Time to fetch the choppers and bring out the U-hauls
Extra mannish
I make you vanish
I play for keep
Investigate that ass till they find out where you sleep
Muthafucka it's commakausi
Don't even try me ah
I bars none you best believe that I'ma bring me ah
Fully automatic Tommy with the infared say I'm sorry
Before I pump your ass full of lead and dump the body
Extra mannish, that's what people be calling me
Oh we can be cool until you get to threatening me
I lose my temper and shit my eyes turn red
Blow my top and get real hot at the head
I guess I'm a failure, I gots no future in my front
All I'm able to do is sell dope and hit the blunt
Don't ask me why Sometimes I go to church and testify
The preacher preaches and I be dang near ready to cry
Repute the devil
I got to get out of the ghetto freak
Sometimes I wonder if mommy and daddy really payin' me
Who would ever thought that a nigga like me
Would become such a bad ass youngster
My mommy and daddy done fucked around and created a damn monster
Why couldn't I wait till I was bigger
Before I started drinking malt liquor
I guess I was a nappy headed stubborn little mannish ass nigga
(Mugzy)
Guess who comes through, comes through
It's me the Y-O-U-N-G
M-U-G-Z
I'm just as mannish as I wanna be I pack a 30-30
Niggas wanna blast me because I'm down and dirty
Extra mannish how I'm livin' and I'm fuckin' my neighbors bitch an
She lovin' every minute of the dick that I be givin'
Bitches on my jock, Bitches on my jock
Suckas on the block know I got a glock
Bini caps, B-coats and all of that
I'm beatin' niggas down with a baseball bat
I'm havin' revenues I'm gettin' paid fool
A ghetto muthafucka with an attitude
S-I-C-K W-I-D I-T
It's young mugzy and E-40
It's explains why it's hard for us blacks and hispanics
And why we turned extra mannish"
47,Fallin' Rain,2002,Grit & Grind (2002),Hip Hop,E-40,"From a small ass little tadpole swimmin in a fallopian tube
To a fixture on my soil, a stand up type a dude
I was brought up in the crack game dealin' and pushin that stuff
Arguing with my folkers 'cause we loved eachother so much
Ditchin and dodgin the rollers, grippin the block real tuff
Strikin and scootin them Novas and them Chevrolet stepside trucks
Me and my brother Dennel, Kevin, Dalon, and Black
Little Ray, Billy, and Ivory and them from the Magazine Street camp
Posted up like thumbtacks, talking on faulty big backs
Motorola, A1 yola, glad bag fulla Tic Tacs
In the mean time, in between time, in my spare time writin raps
In the front yard, in the driveway, on the concrete shootin craps
You think you know, but you really don't have no idea
Listen to discography of E40, real talk for real
Moons ago, way before I even had a career
I got my nickname on the turf for drinking hecka beer
And never letting the older cats up in my hood pump fear
Funkin with my own soil, listen here
Jealous 'cause we had all the broads and all the gear
Up the ladder I'm tryin' to climb, game sharper than a porcupine spine
Don't gimme nothing, I'ma work for mine, try and grind, grit and grind
Hot ones echo through the ghetto, funkin all the time
I thank the Lord for giving me the gift to spit this rhyme
A loaf of bread, a stick of butter and some milk
Around the corner from the spot where all the dealers dealt
Trials and tribul-i-zations, me and my peopl-i-zations
Tryin' to get this music off the ground with high ass expectations
Took a little time and patience, a little faith in God
To make a long story short, look at me now sahob
I'm doing it chubby like the checker, chunky like the soup
A de- a decade and a half and still in the loop
In case you suckers didn't know, I told you once before
I ain't rapping too fast, see y'all just listening too slow
I paved the way for the independent grind
The industry they mimick me, but don't wanna gimme mine"

Without even havin' any 'n' kind of intention on even payin'
Damn near flashin, that's what the fuck I'm doin'
And I'm blastin up in this motherfucker
I got my motherfuckin weiner out and I'm sayin' fuck the world
I'm pissin on everything, fuck it, nigga I'm flashin
I'm actin' bad
I got all kind of marbles on the motherfuckin table
And I'm tellin' a motherfucker you touch my shit and I'm flashin
Understand my shit, the situation is way damn real
Motherfucker I'm drunk off the shit
And I'm breakin bottles on the pavement, I'm flashin
Nigga I'm out there bad I'm poppin' in the air for nothin'
Nigga for no apparent reason I'm DUH DUH DUH DUH check it out
At this, got it fired up, choppers in the back of the truck
About to light the nigga crib up
Bang bang shoot 'em up claim fame
Got a little to my name, slick as sugar cane
Three in the mornin it's hard labor chasin paper
Nigga twerkin', go to several Russian car
Cluckers comin' through with VCR's
Microwave ovens and credit cards
Pullin all kind of heavy metal straps
Beatin' bitches down with bumper jacks
L-R-P's bitches overseas shoot craps
Tryna to have more paper than a fax
Motherfuckers gettin' to showin out when they off ecstasy
Liable, to fuck a hoe on her menstrual cycle
Vital, lookin' out for the rival tribal dead on arrival
Psycho, it's all about survival
Quarter ounce zippers is on
Run up in his home while he slappin bones
With the chrome pist-al, pistol-whip a nigga
With a zap board, Zenith hammer, Arm and Hammer
Bakin soda, listenin to the scanner
Scared man can't win, especially when I'm paper packin
Fetti stackin, mashin, flashin
I'm flashin, the Elroy's pulled me over
And put the flashlight to my window and told me I was speedin
And I got to, fa-lashin on they ass
I got to actin' like a demon the motherfuckers told me
The other day I go to turn off my P-G-and-E
Nigga and I got to actin' bad and I got to flashin
On a motherfucker, motherfucker come out there
Talkin' crazy to me lookin' at me crazy up in the motherfuckin sto'
And I said, ""Bitch I'm F-ah-lashin!""
Don't let me get to flashin on yo' ass nigga
Motherfucker up in the club, and a motherfucker step on my shoe
And I got to fa-lashin!
It's all bad, motherfucker used to be my comrade
Used to fuck the same hoes, wear each others clothes
Closer than a booger to a nose, choosin' vogues
Slammin' Cadillac do's together, cookin crack
And make these zippers back, overkill
Put the whammy on the whoop, be on the lookout
For the state troop, might shoot
Durin the drug deal, flippy at the mouth
Voluntarily ratted your motherfuckin folkers out
Tight about since Little League, Boy Scouts
Paper route dropped a dime to get some days dropped
I'm uh, I'm ooh cranky, moody like a old hag
Shit gone get hella stanky if you square snitch-ass
Sucka butt-ass niggaz don't bring me back my motherfuckin duffle bag
Consequences off the hinges
Lean ballin, alcohol and weed
A thousand dollars worth of chump change, chicken feed
A criminal record a full of dirty deeds
Givin' niggaz black eyes and bloody lips
Cauliflower ears and extra clips
Gun clappin music slappin party crashin
Blastin, motherfucker flashin
The holiday just came on the first second and third of the month
Made my check late and I got to, flashin on motherfuckers
Next door neighbor hollerin that shit about my beat too loud
I walked up the motherfuckin steps and I got ta
Tellin' that bitch I'm F-ah-LASHIN
Send a rookie to the store to bring me back some Rossi Ron
He brought me back Chablais, and I get to FLASH
On that bitch ass motherfucker, silly nigga
Yknahmsayin? A motherfucker up in this motherfucker FLASHIN
Get to testin my testicles nigga and I'ma FLASH on yo' ass
Behind my back and it get back to me and I'm flashin
Lost all my money up in the dice game and I FLASH
Didn't let me up in the Club Cafe Echelon and go to FLASHIN
Dopefiend ran off with a hundred count of my defense and I FLASHED
B of A wouldn't cash my faulty money order
So I took it to Scottie's to keep myself from flashin
Bought $250 worth of liquor and they tried to charge me
For some ice and I FLASHED
Got jumped outside a house party and my fools left me for dead
When I got home I seen them motherfuckers
And they ass was in the red, I got to FLASHIN
I tell ya, bitch these niggaz I tell ya
Shit I tell ya, SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT BITCH, shit!"

The foundation was laid several years ago
I built a whole empire in your stereo
Got a four leaf clover representin the Bay
Oakland, Frisco, Vallejo, and EPA
We keep the shit together, let's keep it that way
From Sacramento all the way to San Jose
We in a new era, for ten years you made hits
So what's up E-Feezi? (We still the shit) Beotch!

How you think I got this pot belly, overnight?
Shet a nig-ga was hongry, I had an appetite
Just like a lie to my people that's caught up in the struggle
Motherfuckers tryin' to bubble, niggaz tired of slangin
Barney Rubble, gettin' in trouble and fuckin' up
Parole got me makin' my kids piss in a cup
It's cold, that's why I got a few bucks, I put up
From sellin greens, investing in some vending machines
From the ground up

Nobody really gave a damn about us

From the ground up, here go some details
This verse right here was made, said strictly for the females
Don't y'all know it's time for y'all to blow up, like Napalm
Instead of sellin Tupperware, and Avon
Get your business license, go on and put the peas in the pot
Tell your baby to get your baby daddy to buy you a nail shop
Or a beauty saloon, since he come to be the biggest tycoon
With methamphetamine laughs and heroin balloons
(Too $hort)
Six po-lice pulled me over laid a nigga on the ground
Searched my car real good I know you know what they found
I had the trunk, full of that junk
X-Rated lyrics, laced with the funk
No doubt, I was just about to flood the streets
Big boxes full of tapes with them dopefiend beats
Two white boy groupies, mad as hell
Black men makin' mail, couldn't take him to jail
(Too $hort)
I spent sixteen hundred makin' Born To Mack
Used my niggaz gold ropes and his Cadillac
I was broke to start with, didn't give a fuck
Couldn't tell me Short Dawg wasn't comin' up
When motherfuckers roll by bumpin your stuff
It makes you feel good, like when you bust a nut
Now I'm a millionaire, and can't get enough
Forty tell 'em how it is (way too tough Short Dawg)
(E-40)
When I first started rappin' motherfuckers would cap!
""That nigga fake he sound like Woody Pecker on crack (ha ha ha HA ha)""
Niggaz would laugh and say I rap too fast way back then
But now I be catchin all kind of motherfuckers
Tryin' to sneak my little old style in
And that's a compliment, 'cause I ain't trippin' on the money
(What about the money what about the money)
Ask me, sheeit, I think there's enough money up in this bitch
For all of us, we can Sasquatch pimp the system without a doubt
All we gotta be is bout our paper route

I was intrigued by the way things ran
How it was done (what else) how a bitches mind was run
So I hollered at the master pimp, who was dressed in mink
I asked him could I buy him a drink
He said, ""What can I do for you son?"" I said I wish to pimp
I want yo' same stroll, and I want yo' limp
I want my mail to be as long as yours

Load me up with your finest disk

We ain't broke, we papered up
He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice
He done it again and got rich twice
Keep a thump on top
We ain't broke, we papered up
Gotta a lil' thump, we got what you need
If you want it, got to copy it from me
We are sure you too could see that it's real
Everywhere we go we burn down the hills
Automatics and semi's, high performance and hemi's
In the thick of the soil, we think Buick's is Bentley's
Coffee pots boil, burn, fly, simmer and stew
I'm off of this oil y'all, I hope you is too
Out of the Beverly camp you need a crew
Showing our underwear, exactly that's what we do
Turf dropping and stacking and money making
Surfing, earthquake slapping and trunk rattling
He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice
He done it again and got rich twice
Keep a thump on top
We ain't broke, we papered up
He ain't going nowhere, the boy too nice

Heavy on the grindin' entertainment

(Verse 1 - E-40)
Ooh, Hustlers are us
My game sharper than an elephant's tusk
Me myself at night the only that I can trust
Sleep with one eye open finger on the pistol clutch (Ka ka ka!)
I got my hands and everything, I'm real instrumental
I'm as real as they come and got no bitch potential
When I was comin' up there certain things we don't allow
Like long fingernails and me and arching the eyebrow
Here's another thing I don't condone and don't approve
How all of a sudden snitchin' became cool (I dunno)
I'm gamed up I be chewin' on this mack granite
OG Jay be stomped that laced that niggas posted never can
I brought the baddest broad in the whole facilitation
All by way of mouthpiece just by my manipulation
I can make it look like I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
Persuade the broad to put on the dress and break her for her purse
Ten wraps and a rubber band (Gouda)
Three or four more in my other hand (Gouda)
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty (Gouda)
Twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty (Chalupa)
Gettin' money I'm a stunna, man (Gouda)

Take the wrong turn and these youngstas out here kill ya
Well I ain't concerned, they love us hustlas and dealers
They wanna tear our houses down so they can build some of my kids
Ooh, Just tryna get my point across
Where I'm from it's pandamonium and chaos
Where I'm from the lights is off, we use matches
Where I'm from we do it bare-faced instead of ski masks (Ka ka ka!)
Ooh, No more talking on them cells
I heard the federal went ahead and bought Nextel (what?)
Ooh, Over-crowded jails
They got us sleepin' in the gym instead of our own cells
Ooh, Put our yeti together
Me and my investors, we flippin' ten or better
I got some booty, got a little bit of cheddar
Mama now you got more killers than a peacock better
(Verse 3 - B-Legit)
Gettin' money I'm a stunna man
With bitch like I do little whips about the stunna van
My ? she a runner man
Off top, I'ma boss, shoot a box full of rubber bands
Contraband, on the other hand
Big girls, big quips, turn around, roll center man
On the real, I'm a gentleman
Put the scrilla, I'm a killa, man, hit it like a little man
What you doin' with that?
From the scratch, we can load up the 'lac
A-1, we can bring that back
From day 1, we get them wraps
Big stacks from the back of the shack
Ayee, I buy the weed man
Hella turkey bags just to put my weed in

On the dopetrack workin overtime full of fuckin' 'D' (D!)
Runnin' through somewhere in the neighborhood
Of about seven-hundred thousand in illegal narcotics
Generatin through mah street, a week
Why motherfuckers gotta ask me how I'm doin' if I'm all right?
When a motherfucker's starvin and strugglin
Even on my hip pretty much needlin and jugglin
There STILL ain't gonna never be enough lovin'!
I'm tired of rippin and runnin', dodgin and duckin bullets
I KNOW MY TIME IS COMIN' - death is on me bad
The walls is closin in, I wish I had a dad
But left when I was ten, so moms is all I had
And she was there for me until I ran away from the pad
And now she disowned me and she don't claim me
Reverend wouldja put some blessin oil on my head
Before I end up dead, gall bladder full of lead - scared
I guess a hard-head make a soft-ass (??)
I ain't gon' last if I keep fuckin' with this fast life

Don't wanna go to church, because I feel guilty
Nope - I DON'T WANNA DIE - 'cause when the preacher preach the gospel
I BE READY TO CRY - up in the Church of Pentecostal
I don't think I'ma make it to see twenty-five
Till I wash my hands and come clean
Shit I'll be hella happy if I can just live to see sixteen
No life to give for that nastiness
As a rebellious disobedient-ass problem child
He's easily influenced - hangin' around the wrong crowd
I'm willin' to do almost anything,
Whatever it takes to make my allowance
I'm on prescription medication, chemically off-balance
Got me snatchin up (??), pickin' up hits
Pick-pickin' indo's (do's), and pullin licks

But daddy? (Yes son) Tie my shoes (okay) lace me up (uh)
Hook me up, like a tow-track maaaaan (aight)

65,Happy to Be Here,2006,My Ghetto Report Card (2006),Hip Hop,E-40,"(Feat. D.D. Artis)
(Female singer - repeat in background)
I'm just happy to be here!
(E-40 over singer)
Hard times, the struggle
The ups and downs, the highs and the lows
You know just goin' through it man, ghetto politics
Tryin' to make a way out of no way
I was the oldest, so I had to be, the daddy of the family
Momma had to work three jobs, ooh
Feet stickin through my shoes, skid marks in my drawers
Garage sales and flea markets, we never shopped at malls
No dental plan, no medikit - we poor like rain
Colored folks think that castor oil cures everythang
Pork chops and chicken, we like our food fried
Hypertension, Prenavil pills and hydro-chlorizide
Some of my family still living, some of my family died
Health complications, natural causes and homicide
Just tryin' to survive, nothin' to lose but plenty to gain
Started hustlin, flea flickin and servin' that candy cane
Put all my cars in my lady name, as a true hustler should
She had a 9 to 5, worked at Planned Parenthood
While I was in the hood, up to no good
With a hoodie over my head, tryin' to outslick the feds
Or should I say cops, at this point in time I only had rocks
Went from a little a jelly jar up to a soup pot
The fast quarter my negro, don't want the slow nickel
I done seen yola the same color as peanut brittle
I done seen hella people relapse
I done seen my homey grandparents go back to crack
How sick is dat? Beggin my loved ones to send some pictures
Pray for me over the phone and read me some scriptures
Ooh; it's gloomy out here, dark days ahead
God got my back but the devil he want my head
(Chorus: D.D. Artis)
I'm just happy to be here right now
Lot of my folks been locked up or laid down
See I'm sayin' I ain't shed no tears, no
But I'm just happy to be here
(E-40)
Listen to this, ooh
The devil-me side know that some of y'all done seen it
Somebody's momma washin her son or her daughter's bloodstain off the cement
Wrong place at the wrong time, infiltrators drop a dime
Mistaken identity, bullets start flyin
In every direction, hit a pregnant teen, she passed
But her baby live through a C-section
I know it sound foul and sound hecka rude, it ain't cool
But it go down like that sometime when you're funkin, and you're puttin' down a move
We heartless and shrewd in this day and age, it ain't the same
Our parents need to beat us with a belt, like Poody Tang
I be high like an airplane
I be smokin' and perkin, takin' out anger and stress on the wrong person
Re-uppin and coppin turf an' just servin' the soil block
Grittin tryin' to put some gifts in my kid's Christmas stock'
Ooh - pour out some liquor and shed a tear
For the homies that never made it and family that ain't here
(D.D. Artis)
So happy
You know I'm happy to be
Said I'm happy, so happy just to be here
To beeeeeee, to beeeeeeeeeeee
To beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee (I'm so happy)

I'm so happy to be, to beeeeeeee-heeeeeeeeee
To beeeeeeeee (to be here)"
66,Hide 'n' Seek,1993,Federal (1993),Hip Hop,E-40,"I'm in some deep shit, I got some niggas from another click
On that ass trying to run me off a fuckin' cliff
What should I do? Where should go? How could I fake 'em?
Bust a bitch on that ass and try and shake 'em and bake 'em
Full speed ahead, I know they want my ass dead
Still on my bumper, it makes a motherfucker wonder
All the dirt that I did, should just let them get me
Maybe it's because I killed Rodney and his whole family
Revenge, I see my life flashing, niggas blasting
Brothas passing, trying to make me stay crashing
Into the rocks beside me, fucking up the traffic
17th in a Malibu Chevy classic
But I'm nothing humble, just call me Yapeez Pasano
Full tank of petrol, mobbin' through the fucking tunnel
Shit it's bright, I think I see some daylight
Over the night, you should have seen a brothas sides right
Fit the corners on two shoes, I'm holly G
Wrapping my shit around a fifty foot oak tree
Got out the car, seeing stars, I wasn't lagging
Ran out and hid behind a beat up station wagon
You've never seen a bitch nigga run so fast
You've never seen a bitch nigga run so fast
You've never seen a bitch nigga run so fast
You've never seen a bitch nigga run so fast
Bouncing, sneaking, and peaking, hitting bushes and shit
Never saw, like you see in that movie clip
Steady busting, these motherfuckers ain't bluffing
I'm hauling ass and renting bullets, constantly cussing
Scared as fuck, I wasn't trying to act hard
Thumbs up, and ran in a back yard
Just as I was hoping the sliding door was wide open
Out of breath, I locked the door and started talking
I need some help, I gotta bounce, someone's after me
Please don't panic, I need your help badly
I'm not a G, a killer, or a rapist
I'm just a ordinary black man trying to make this
Busting my bubble, the couple didn't even freak
They said relax, I'll make some coffee, have a seat
The man said, what's your name bro
I said, I don't know, you might decide to call the po-po
He said that ain't my thang, I used to be a leader of a gang
Shot twice in my chest
I got wounds, where I've been stabbed
He took off his shirt and showed me the scab
I said damn partner, how the fuck you survive some shit like that
Like that there without going into a coma
He said the Lord spared my life
So I could talk to people like you and teach them right
I was a dope pusher, big time drug abuser
Alcoholic, dog blumer, but a shooter
All together working from the floor
I said, I better twist so I can call her
Now I'm reached from coast to coast
Said to saved from the holy ghost
I know you think your trapping
But let me pray for you junior and watch what happens"

When you hear this one go ahead and turn it up
From Virgin Islands out to the bay
I, I live and sleep on these streets
'Cause I have got to get mine, my fam, see we gotta eat
So when people ask me why, why don't ever I slow down?
Oh, I just simply reply, I don't really know how
So I, hustle, hustle, hustle
(I'ma hustler, believe me)
You know I hustle, hustle, hustle
(And this ain't easy)
So I hustle, hustle, hustle

You know I hustle, hustle, hustle

It is what it izzzzzz...
It is what it izzzzzz...
We try compromisin, nope - they don't wanna talk
And they got them youngsters off that Acapulco powdered chalk
So he untouchable - or he can be touched??
Well where he stay at then - he stay by such and such??
Well since we got altercations with these so-called knuckleheads
We gon' play for dooms
And I assume we get radar on fool in dem livin' rooms
Bet - motherfucker ain't fin' ta be runnin' around here drippin sweat
Havin' hot flashes and shit
Over these fulla bitch-made and a half-ass dicks
You ripped? Let's take it to 'em sick
Hit all they spots at once - pour it on 'em thick
Who got the suey chops?? They in my folks garage
Well where he at?? He at the TravelLodge - BEEP THAT NIGGA!
Tell him to get here right now quick now it's gon' be some shit
Tell him to bring enough ammunition to blow up a ship
Bullshit ain't nothin' this here been goin' on just a little bit too long
Plus I got a family and kids to raise and I plan on seein 'em get grown
Get straight to the root of the problem
Get rid of the source that's what what
Get rid of the big cheese
And the majority of these niggaz gon' back the fuck up
Somebody gon' mind somethin', time to validate my respects,
And hit the corner dumpin, in a big ass primered stationwagon
CATCH HIS BITCH-ASS! That's what I told my driver
Meanwhile I was tryin' to get into a good enough position
So that I could open fire
FUCK A SKI MASK! I'm hot as fish grease
LET THE FULLY BLAST! May he rest in piss Miss smash up outta there
I brought the noise, but I shoulda brought it like a concert
Fool's still alive, John Muir Trauma Center, Concord
Shoulda doused him, shouldn'ta never found him
Shoulda handled biz, but for now, it is what it izzzzz...
It is what it izzzzzz...
It is what it izzzzzz...
It is what it izzzzzz...
(Kaveo)
Aight, ay dude, this all I wanna know
What's wrong with this sad to be glad-ass noggas?
Don't they know that fools is laced with assassin skills?
Kill at will, gonna put your hat on the rack for a cool mill'?
(Awww it's gon' get done) but now the heat has been spared
How we gon' get him out of intensive care
And put him under the wing of a pall-bear?
(E-40)
One of my potnahs got a plug on some silencers, he knows some agents
He used dem (??) (??) shot on several different occasions
What that mean his family gon' boo-hoo when I smash that card
Put a stain on a nigga brain give a FUCK ABOUT A DIE-HARD!
I know this one botch with a big-ass crutch by the name of Connie
She works in IC unit and she dates this nigga named Mexican Ronnie
Have nab him at the hospital, THAT'LL WORK
Paid a nurse to pull the plug on the LIFE SUPPORT
Risky business but it's organized class and the shit sound sharp
But if we fuck around and make it look too obvious
The broad might her lose her job
Tough luck that shit no better than fuckin' for ME NOW
I gots no toilet paper feelings for her anyhow
The shit is crampin my livin' style, floatin from telly to telly
Conspiracy murder plots phone conversations overheard by fedarale
I'm guessin fool musta passed away, tragic losses
On the wall they got my picture at the post office
After travellin bouncin' back and forth to different states
They finally caught me up in Kansas City
At a barbecue spot called Gates
Do the crime do the time - it ain't for no bitch
And as long as a nigga twerkin' in the kitchen, he ain't trippin'
I'll be up in that bitch makin' spreads, drinkin' Pruno
Cocoa and coffee Cadillacs, jumpin' jacks
Takin' flicks, shootin kites, makin' wishes
Fuck around and get mad on the strength of con-ju-gal vi-sits
Flip the weight pile, hit my fee-vee (?)
Keep my shank close by me when I'm sleep'in
Shouldn'ta caught me, shouldn'ta never found me
Shoulda handled biz, but it's too late, it is what it izzzzz...
It is what it izzzzzz...
It is what it izzzzzz...
It is what it izzzzzz...
(Kaveo)
Oh, oh I see
It is what it was, and what it was is just what's been taught
Handle biz when it's to be done, and I mean rip you dig?
Cause ain't no sense in savin' leftovers
That's yesterday's thing, roll with the right now
And everything gon' be is, what it izzzzzz..."

Son: Daddy
E-40: What's Up?
Son:Whatchu doin'?
E-40: Sittin' up here marinatin. Just, you know, trippin' off how this life is man, lifes a trip.
Son: well, what you writin?
E-40: Just you know so old crazy, you know some sh... my feelins, you know?
Son: Let me hear it.
(E-40)
Why was I born in these trifling ass times?
Why is it mandatory that I carry nines?
Don't be to civil 'cause even white folks get jacked to
Doctors, high class lawyers and even Japs too
You ask me why I speak the real the way I feel
How come we call bitches hoes and you call us negros?
They want to do me like they did Stacks
What is this young black man doing with all that scratch? huh
I see some timahs on the yayo track readin they mail
Talking bout ""I got white girl for sale""
But they ain't talking to me 'cause I'm an oldie and they knows that
I used to be just like them I tell them ""y'all get that scratch""
Magazine was never nothing like Bel Air
High speed shoot outs and shit, but I loved it there
40 where you've been playa, it's been a while?
Marinatin' accumulating paper pal
Y'all kind of doin' it huh, you still grindin?
Hell yeah, you know them tapes you keep rewinding
Money ain't changed me, money changed the way people think about me
When I was broke all I had was my family
You know what kills me doe them fuckin' numskulls
I hate when blacks be clowin blacks on all these talk shows
It's bad enough we shootin up each other tragically
Two days ago they found some brother smothered badly
Nobody's to be trusted in this day and age
To much jealousy and envy on the wrong page
And fuck the po po because that 39% tax I pay
Don't get me nathin (nothin') but a choke hold and some pepper spray
Son: So is that what they do?
E-40: it's all bad
Son: Its crazy out there huh?
E-40: it's all bad
Son: Is it gonna be like this when I grow up?
E-40: It's all bad
Son: Daddy, sprinkle me with some more game.
Our father who art in heaven
Hollowed be thy name thy kingdom come
That's the prayer that I say so spread the word
And if you feeling down and out read proverbs
You know that I've been tweakin off something strange
Startin to see a lot of womens at the shootin range
Domestic violence but here's an old ghetto myth
My potnas auntie scold her boyfriend with some hot grits
I'm from the G-E double T-T to the oh no
Where only few dare to go
(E-40 Jr.)
I spits game like a soldier
Tonk since I told you this
Rap kingpin giant, six year old vocalist
You don't want to see me
Do it like I do that
All up in your tall-can face I tell you get more scrilascratch
Y'alll need to get up on it
The game is way to deep
I'm not your average hustler
I be creepin' while you sleep
Game, Straight game
Get up on it, Straight game
It's all Bad"
82,It's All Gravity,2002,Grit & Grind (2002),Hip Hop,E-40,"(Talking)
What it do, what that is pimp
What you say, talk to me I talk back
Ooh, I heard that, ooh
(E-40)
Skinny bank, phat bank, foreign cars, candy paint
Jelly jars, battle scars, rap stars, pullin' rank
Drinkin' drank, hit the dank, getting stank, from a skank
Stick and move, show and prove, ghetto jew, think I ain't
Have the grip, pockets fit, dirt pee stained mattress man
Chopping up llelo, top of a dirty ass pee-stained mattress man
Put a razor blade in a safety pain in my hand
Takin' incarceration, penitentiary chances man
Half a grand I spend a day, chicken feed, half a pow wow
Off some weed, love the pow wow, when I'm keyed, keep my style now
Watch me speed, trust that cuff that love that
Rubik's spit, talk walk with a limp while I'm here makin' love
Ooh!
Say you wanna be a rap star, drive a real nice car
Without true game you can't get far, but it's all gravity
Struggling, gritting grinding mayn, it's all gravity
It's all gravity, I'm so deep off in this game
It's all gravity, struggling, gritting grinding mayn
It's all gravity, I'm so deep off in this game
(E-40)
Just something that was happening now, like goomer pile
I predict in about a month, y'all gone love this huh
Make a gangsta wanna funk, all in your trunk
Got him hollering yeah that shit there ain't no punk
Fully recouped, money chunky like the soup
Back in the days I use to rock a troop jacket
Me and everybody in my cabinet, we was timin'
If you had the Troop jacket you was grindin'
So who the playa, even if I'm in a pinto
Show some respect little niggas see I'm respectable
My hoochie is a general, a silent soldier, no faking
Quick to set an example put down a demonstration
Wake you up to a rude awakening and no escaping and
Once I give you the phone I put a shake on in
See I done did it, and lived it, and done it, hit the block
Choke a motherfucker out for trying to short stop
(E-40)
Make no mistake about it, I'm smoking hell-a-tweed
That ain't organic, nigga that's designer weed
No it ain't, yeah it is, no it ain't
No it ain't, yeah it is, no it ain't, yeah it is
Scream, holla, scream and shout it, I love my folks to death
Way too many cooks in the kitchen but I'm the iron chef
Too many chiefs, but not enough indians
See everybody needs to play they position
I'm pitching, leader of the squad, be on the look-out for my
Brand new clothing line, my brand new clothing line is called Shob
Rossi wine, Carlos Rossi wine is what I drink
Not all the time but most of the time it helps a playa think
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes they the same color as garlic butter
Look at my guys, look at my guys, they off that Goldschlager
It's a daily routine, I mean, I mean we do this here
So savagely pimperoni it's all gravity"

Yeah (3x)

They want problems; soon them want me waxed, contracts on my ass
It's comin' from the pen, they say I owe 'em cash
Dwellin off the past and they need it fast
But what they fai'lize is I'll be quick to blast
Die hard cold blooded killer all about my work
Dressed up like a female in a mini-skirt
Specialize in doin' dirt - shootin niggaz in the shirt
Put the pistol in his mouth and make it hurt, ooh
Cutlass, guzzlin down a 40-ounce bottle of Swiss malt liquor brewsky
Talkin' to a cutie standin outside the movie theater
Sittin' on top of the hood of my Cutlass
Smokin' on a non-filter pink pack colored edition cigarette
Clove-family affiliated cancer stick lookin' +GANESH+ beadie
What the fuck? W here's the peace treaty?
Full of my Wheaties, yes indeedy, M-16's don't shoot no beebees
Programmed to amputate anything that gets off in my way
Then I put them same size left over bullets up in my A.K.
I can't wait till we bump heads
It on, on sight day and night no matter what I'm dumpin'
I'm tryin' to see you niggas 'bout somethin' (2x)
""I'm heated, them niggas cheated"" - 3X (in background)
We had a meetin', shit 'posed to been squashed (3x)
Shit was 'posed to been squashed
(E-40)
I've got a hunch; meet me at the Olive Garden spot let's do lunch
Fool and dem tried to pass the buck and set us up for lumps
Sons of bitches must think we some chumps
Time to break out the pipe bombs and the pumps
(C-Bo)
Nigga fuck stress and pull lick, we kick in the door with full clips
Out of Magnums packin when we blast 'em we all out for the chips
FOol, 40-Water never slip, saw the niggaz quick and then dipped
Before we spark the pipe bombs, and blow them niggaz shit to
Side-ways up off they block, poppin' gears in a big block
All out non stop riders until our casket drop
We smashin, blastin on any, while I remember many
Dash and blastin double two-three's, fuck the enemies
(E-40)
One of my big dudes up out HPA shot me a kite today
He up in Pelican Bay three striker
Doin' 25 with a L 'cause he won't tell on one of his
High-ranked dudes in position who wears a diaper
With the shit stacked on the side of his waist
Blood splattered all on the windshield wiper
Somebody tried to take his face - caught him up in his Viper
Loose as a goose ass out tried to down him like a sniper
Hyperventilated started havin' seizures
No feelings in his legs, arms, or his sneakers
(C-Bo)
We stand tall, like Manute Bol with bigger balls than RuPaul
Strapped with 4-4's down to execute all y'all
Don't want to see us niggas on a mission
150 round drum 45 slugs bitten
No remorse hit by the hardcore fo' sho'
Leave him stuck in his front seat
70 rounds through his front window
Ain't no fuckin' with G's
Fill 'em up to they neck from they knees
Leave 'em dyin' in the street as we escape on they goldeeze"

Tryin' to have a stable full of, gregarious, clear bitches
Professional wonderful ladies of leisure, merrylicious

And believe that, e'rytang I tell her to do is for the best
Hoe you in violation, you in the red, wait a minute hoe

After a big ol' player like me done buttered yo' bread?

But that ain't my business, I keep my game universal
And leave that ol' (??) around shit up to them squares like Urkel
It's too many lobsters up in the ocean, big pimps
But not enough mobsters breakin them in, big pimps
Tellin' 40 done taught us how to beginnnnnn
Pull a bitch off the streets and real her innnnnnn
To my sable, but e'rybody ain't able
Now she's a call girl, dancin on the table

I got niggaz in 'Sace suits, trickin big
Timers in 'gator boots, givin' in

Athletes, 'cause they respect a bitch
Man you'd be surprised how many niggaz love to pay for pussy
Niggaz cheat on they wives and jack up all they fuckin' money man
I be givin' my hoes, bonuses and benefits
Boat cruises and Kamal outfits
Latex to keep their health a good
Checkups at Planned Parenthood (that's it)

I never stayed my ass home I always thought that I was grown
In the traffic I was gone you see my head was made of stone
Got a problem with me?
Then feel free muthafucka Don't be talkin' under yo breath
'Cause that might be the cause of your death
'Cause I'ma quick to stop a nigga in his tracks main
So let's get this shit out in the open
I used to like to go from the shoulders get 'em up, one on ones
Now it's a whole different ball game niggas that carry guns
A sucka will kill you first, and you will be layin in the hurst
Takin' a deep ass sleep knowin' it wasn't worth
Provin you wasn't a punk
Niggas don't want to thump
Niggas just want to funk and shot up a niggas trunk
I met a bitch last week at the Orgen Room
Bought her a drink and said ""what's up on the telly room?""
Just then I felt some trouble kickin in
Spotted her X-boyfriend who had just got out the pen
Muthafuckas get to baulkin when the liquors talkin'
Drunk muthafucka step on my toe and kept on walkin'
I said ""what's up with ya potna, say excuse me or somethin""
He turned around looked at me and started mean muggin
I guess he thought he pumped fear until I said
""Nigga don't you know I'll have you touchin everything in here""
He went for his pistol and didn't know I was strapin
Dag nab it, I had to let him have it
What type of nigga did he think you was E?
I know he didn't think that you were some kind of peanut or somethin'.
He must of been retarded to the fact that you get a thrill out of killin'
Now tell me somethin' why do muthafuckas wait till that nigga commits
Himself to realize that a hillside hillbilly is the wrong type of
Nigga to Fuck with? E do you feel me?
Yeah I feel ya sahob
Well lets take it to the next page then
Oh you mean that part about the dungeon?
You Knoowww!
The next morning, I'm sittin' in the dungeon-wonderin
Should I be dissed nope I did it in self defense
I wasn't twisted, I hadn't even started yet
It happened to fast before someone could stop me
I wish I had some DANK WEED
While I wait out these 24 more hours before I plead
Freedom I'm gonna miss ya (I wish I had some dice)
Made me some dice out of some water and toilet tissue
Now this the part that's fucked up
I walks into the dayroom manner room what the fuck
I never thought that I would straight make ah
The front page of the newspaper
Shut up a do wop, shut up a do wop
Man they bout to send me up state ah
Talking that shit about makin' me a muthafuckin faggot
I make a shank outta plastic and let a nigga have it
That's what's really goin' down
'Cause when a muthafuckas down for the count
You gotta be about it or be without it
'Cause what a muthafucka once told me see a mark sleep
Leave him sleep in the middle of the street
If you can't stand the heat stay up out the kitchen
Now I'm still in the county's face
Fighting this funky ass 187 case
Shoot me a kite that's a good way to mingle
I'll be in this bitch eatin' shit on the fuckin' shingle
Gettin' big as a house- bulkin up
400 club waiting for the Mercedes deep roll it up
My dream came true after almost 2 years of incareration
Now I'm out drinkin' brew Havin' fun with my folks
Lovin' everybody gettin' twisted and crackin' jokes
Huggin anybody cryin
I missed every nigga in my click and I ain't lyin'
We bones out to a party
I'm on P-role but what can I say
I can't let 'em know I'm stuck
I roast bitches but I'm not a damn peanut
Now I'm at the party thought I wasn't
Dancin' with the dead niggas fine ass cousin
I wonder if she thinkin' my my my
The bitch been lovin' me ever since Hogan High
She had some hard ass cousins that wasn't wit it
They went out they way to make sure that I didn't get it

On these dark murky bloody streets of Vallejo, where I get my cheese
Never mind the trauma playa, you don't wanna be wearin a helmet
I'm not divin back in the cocoa plant game Mr. Johnny Law I'm celibate
Rebellion, slightly throwed off, but hella smart (smart)
Got the mouthpiece of a pimp (and what?)
And a perm like Reverand Sharp' (Sharp')
Now tell me if I'm wrong (wrong)
If I open up my, own barbershop, and get me a small business loan
Gotta lay it down for a minute (whatcha gon' do?) Do what you do
If you in the jail, don't let the jail get in you
And the C-H-P's think they slick, trick
They got a new device out there for high-speedin called the spike strip
See potnah dude right there (uh-huh) he talk more shit than my batch
But he's a coward (coward) and plus a pumpkin in a pumpkin patch
He's a wussy (wussy) if I didn't know better, seriously
Pimpin', you'd think he got a pussy (got a pussy)
(Chorus: E-40)
Some gon', betray you, and some gon', be loyal
Some gon', betray you, and some gon', be loyal
Some gon', betray you, and some gon', be loyal
Some gon', betray you, and some gon', be loyal
(Verse Two)
Ooh, he was listenin to my tape (to my tape)
He was on his way home last night
Out of bounds and they got him at the plate (at the plate)
Soon as he put his foot on the porch, they to' his ass up
(What he had comin'?) He had it comin' (oh boy)
Now keep in mind (mind)
This nigga done been shot (how many times?) Fo' or five times
This nigga done been shot, three times befo' this time
(For what?) For lyin', and havin' numerous conversations with the law
(For what?) For spyin and havin' diarrhea of the jaw (of the jaw)
I don't get along with undercover
Like Republican and Democrat, we don't cut for each other
I think it's hella WRONG when us brothers
Rat each other out, and roll on one another
Ooh, dis rap is just like the coke game
(Illegal dope, but it's cutthroat)
Dis coke game is just like the rap game
(With saditty, plastic ass folk)
(Verse Three)
Ooh, like a tittie I used to buy my gal the songs
To send my breezy up in Albertson's
Just to make grocery just to play it off
Why (why?) Because... I figure if I did it it'll be too obvious
But whaddayou mean too obvious? Sheist
Arm and Hammer baking soda in gumbo pots white napkin wipin
Oh I see - that makes a lot of sense
Pimpin' you kinda smart huh? Ain't never had to hit a fence
You got boys? (Boys?) Do I, strength
What did you start off with? A sixteenth, a pinch
You sittin' fat (fat) I know that for a fact
Don't let these glasses fool, see I just look like that
Be the first one to pop a cap, first one to put one through ya
Don't think just 'cause I rap, that I won't take it to ya
I don't think you squares understand
You ain't fuckin' wit a boy (who you fuckin' wit?)
You fuckin' wit a man
(E-40)
That's big spittin', oh boy, fo' sho'
Motherfuckers ain't stickin to the script no mo'
(Nah they ain't stickin to the script)
You know that's why when you find a real cat
(What you supposed to do?) Find a real tycoon on your team?
(Uh-huh) You gon' cherish that pimpin-ass nigga mayn y'know?
(Fo' sho') 'Cause they hard to come by mayn, just like a bitch mayn
Just like bitches are hard to come by, the good ones?
Niggaz is hard to come by; real niggaz y'know?
That ain't on no gay shit, that's on some real shit, dig that
Oh boy! Uh... (Not on no gay shit nigga, be pimpin')

96,Mack Minister,1996,Tha Hall of Game (1996),Hip Hop,E-40,"I'd like to thank the mack god for all tha playa prophets that he sent
I'd like to thank him for Donald Going and Iceberg Slim
For dottin their I's and crossin their T's, poppin' their P's, and
Flexin their G's
I'd like to thank the mack god for all the playa prophets that he
Sent before me and 40 water
For the mack I chose 40 water
To come into the world and change and rearrange
To lace the suckers and the anti playa
He came in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, on the glad sandwich bag
And floated ashore
And as soon as he hit the shore, he balanced the game
He said that nine-tenths of his law was possession
And that nine-tenths of his game was position
And that everything was done on the approach
The mack god said that he would send an extraordinary one
On the side of 40 water and he won't just be a playa
He will be an extraordinary playa
Now we gonna turn the mack book from page 211 to chapter 187
And it talks about how they had a kangaroo court for the playas
And how dem suckas is out there with trumped up charged on E-40
Well, if you wanna judge the 40 water, bring him before 12 G's
And open his files
And you will see that he has been true with a capital T since he
Was knee high to a grasshopper
That the mack god said that in the year 1555, that there was a
Great explosion and some of the playas inhaled some fumes
Pertaining additives, preservatives and artificial flavors
The mack god refers to them as suckas
And he said that he would send one that would come from one
That was despised and rejected
And that he would send this extraordinary one in the world
And when he come, he would come with ten commandments
And the commandments would be:
Thou shall not snitch
Thou shall not infiltrate
Thou shall not perpetrate
Thou shall not playa hate
Thou shall not hold trust
Thou shall not hold say
Thou shall not pay a trick
Thou shall not disrespect the game
Thou shall not be broke
And thou shall not be without their thang
The mack god said that just because you meet a hoe
And she wears a jersey that say champion and eat a bowl of wheaties
Don't make her a winner
Will she sell her hips, her lips and her fingertips
Will you tear down doors
And knock out CO's
Can you go the distance
Will you be the one with the checkered flag in your hand
Yeah, 'cause I will be the winner"

Split yo house in half, with a dreadlock wig on

Faded visions of me as a timer
Though marijuana clouds my vision I'm still watch for drama, ha-ha

And plot and plan a life of better thangs, all about my chedder main
Help me if I fall, can I ball for life

And get my fortune out of my drinking club
(E-40)
E-40 in the C-L-I-C
Stuck up in the house, party top celebrity
Burpin and gurpin, gelchin the bourbon, lurkin around
I'm seein all kinda broads, from outta town
Uh, top hots, tycoons, big cheeses
Plus the perpetual jahahnjawel priestess
Homies and lurkers and things like that up under the vertical shade
Rovers in lamborghinis swimming pink bikinis, lingerie
Tryin' to knock her big ass by all bus lights on Fridays
If you're not a member of my drinking club, sideways
What kind of motherfuckin perculatoins you niggaz got
Up in the refrigerator?
Who wanna join my drinkin' club, sign up the legislature
Might not know how to read and write but I do know how to count money
You can call me Lieutenant Fuck a Hoe but all the ruskie runny
You can dip but don't screw up, speakers on sub
Beat your ass, my drinking club
*Chorus w/ variations* 2X
(Young Mugzi)
I got you perved on some of the righteous, who's the tightest
I'm down with pipes fifth and gallons of the finest nitrous
Oh girl now pass the joint to the nigga big head
Where I hear about your scheamin but the rotations I don't jinn
Who dog sin? Big fin is what I'm rollin'
You know how I do, I got bunny boo boo grippin and totin
Fools be pimpin', we guaranteed to have you spittin'
Bobcat tight, while I'm pullin secure out my linen
I'm nothin' but a baller, alkaholic bitches pop my collar
Tearin down pussy walls in your motherfuckin daughter
M-O-S, S-I-E
M-U-G, and K-I-V
Always to' with E-4-0
Hit the air like cubes by a liquor store
(E-40)
Motherfuckers better know, we gets down like that
Straighten up, beer mugs, my drinkin' cup bitch!
*Chorus w/ variations* 2X
So damn deep, I can't call it
I guess I'm just an alkaholic
Huh, dagnabbit, doggonit
Ya Hillside hillbilly vomit
Back and forth to the bathroom constantly
All the actors gather up, and watch me
Get super twisted highly afflicted every day a cherry
Go on my body and throw up on the bartender
Pull out a wad of money, ballers up to par
Treat the whole party, by buyin up the bar
Sharp pain and orange juice got my moose up
Stainless artichokes, tequila poppes, Medusas
Better prepare myself for the upset stomach, oh
Stop by the M.P. on the way home and pick up a bottle of Pepto-Bismol
Step right up now last call for alcohol
Get your hurricane gorilla member here ya monsters
That's right, 'cause when we and my motherfuckin entourage
Get together and we come back from a motherfuckin concert
And the afterpaty jumpin' off, I wanna see ID's, we got video cameras
We checkin' all you bastards under 21 or under 18 or whatever however
Ya understand that? You better have your membership card
If you wanna come join my motherfuckin drinkin' club, understand that bitch?
A: It's the drinkin' club, we gets to' back main
Once you drink with us, you won't be the same
The drinkin' club, we can't slow down main
We're gonna drink you all, we got a monster pit
That's right
B: I wanna get high, I wanna get loaded
And tuck, throw up, and drink again
Repeat A, first line of B, then chorus 5X (E-40 talking throughout)"

Intro: E-40
I pledge allegiance to the ghetto, uh
I pledge allegiance to the game, uh
I pledge allegiance to the money and the cars
And the pussy and the bitches and the fame, uh
(Beeyatch!)
To all my, to all my hoodlums and my thugz with their mugs on
Up in the ghetto and the hood with the platex rubber gloves on
In the kitchen cookin chicken, diamonds, hop and gab
Droppin' off packages and grindin outta taxicabs
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up ugh
Throw it up nigga, throw it up, throw it up
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up (nigga)
Throw it up nigga, throw it up, throw it up
(WC)
Fuck talkin', I'm chalkin niggas, best ta get ta walkin'
It's The Shadiest, Charlie Hustle and my nigga the Chickenhawk in on
That 'throw it up throw it up' dip, as I dips, skip with the Euro clip
Hangin' for chips on 100-spoke whips
All I know is pussy, money and color bandanas
And tryin' to get my kids some more chickens than Colonel Sanders
Play us by the trigger so I'ma live by the trigger
And rivals, seven bitches for all my hoodlum and thug niggas
(E-40)
???? ???? Regulations in the game, never snitch, never sang soprano
Wild gravy, bustin' kilo grams, goin' platinum, door and panel
Never dustin up, never crackin' under pressure
Seems to me I do my time and I get out whenever, EARLY
People say I smell like Glocks, what kind of ?car? you got?
I tell 'em ""Brooklyn cotch""
Johnnie Walker, snapple lemon-squeezed and scotch is what
I drink a nigga up under the table
While all you powder puff niggas take all my votes
To all my hoodlums and my thugz with their mugs on
Up in the ghetto and the hood with the platex rubber gloves on
In the kitchen cookin chicken, diamonds, hop and gab
Droppin' off packages and grindin outta taxicabs
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up ugh
Throw it up nigga, throw it up, throw it up
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up (nigga)
Throw it up nigga, throw it up, throw it up
(Mack 10)
Well it's that old Inglewood gangbang, hustlin ass nigga
That dope game, flossin ho, bustin' ass nigga
Still grindin while rhymin now up to seven figures
Low-down, duct tapin, 2-11 lick hitter
Hoo Bangin' sendin birds outta town on the bus
If ya in to sellin crack, nigga fuck with us
I got cars and a mansion with wine in the cellar
And a bitch on my team that'll kill when I tell her
(E-40)
Back with ninjas so ya know
I do this for Folsom and ?Susanville?, fo' sho'
My niggas in Quentin and Vacaville, before I
From Chino to Tracey to Hatchedby to Rikers Island
Pelican Bay solid, dat Long Park and Terminal Island
Keep on smilin', dialin and callin connect
'Cause you're my focus, you know I'm accept
A za-, a zap board, deuce amps
Shoot dice with, to all my stamps (BEEYATCH!)
(WC)
Could it be me, or was it this chronic or Bombay
That got me puttin' it down for all my hoodlums around the way
Lex spares, money dippin, bullet-proof vests and sack warriors
All my street niggas, east to the west to the souths, I can't hearin ya
(Mack 10)
If it ain't Charlie Hustle, it's that nigga Mack Manson
While the G homies boogie, we keep they hoes dancin
And we stay Lexed up wit the parlay features
Sportin beamed-up Chucks wit the flamed-up creases
(E-40)
I represent the flat lands, the alley ways, the moms and pops
The Chinese, the AK, the fiend, the rocks
The liquor store on every corner, the laundromat
The quick-to-run-up-on-the-nigga, to peel my cap
Outro: E-40
A dollar bill y'all, a dollar bill y'all
A getcha, a getcha, a getcha scrill y'all
A dollar bill y'all, a dollar bill y'all

Check this out you been listenin' for awhile
Why don't you tell these niggas
What they really thinkin' about
When be wrappin' this mail
Turn my mail, I talk to rappers when I touch down
I'ma go by me a check with my bitches welfare check
And if I hurt her feelings who gives a fuck
I'm out for myself, bout to make me a smooth cover
I keep it on the under in a closet on the hush hush
On my way to victories downtown surplus
To get a blend aqua windbreaker
To match blue latchin' vendeta
Scadalism, that's what I'm majorin' in
Yeah, murderism I'm doin' niggas in
So give up the ghost my nigga
Remember me, I used to be your main nigga
But fuck ya, I'm jealous and I hate ya fuckin' guts
I got it in me cause ya clockin' do-do bucks
Break yourself, makin' quarters, ladies rings, chains
I'll take that cartridge out and set it on the range
Prepare for the jack if ya sellin' coke
As long as I got me a strap nigga, I'm never broke
As long as I got me a strap, I'm never broke
Got the nigga car at the mall on bricks
Beat strip, beat tip fucked him like a bitch
I'm that nigga to hate playas
A playa hater starvin' like Somalia
You got some yo-yo
'Cause I'm right back chokin' again
Chokin' mo' now before I did when I went in
Tomorrow I got to go take a p*ss test for real
I'm tryin' to clean out my system with stay clean and golden seals
But I'm gon' be late, I'm on vacation
Because it's too early for me to go back on a violation
Fuck my P.O. I need some M-O
N-E-Y so I can get high and kick in this nigga's door
It's four in the morning I'm on a mission peep
The best time to catch a nigga in his sleep
Wake ya ass motherfucker I know ya rich
Tell me where the fuck is yours, I'ma bust ya bitch
Do dick in ya greasel I tie him up
And made him watch me poke her, I'm never broke
Do dick in ya greasel I tie him up
Then I made him watch me poke her, I'm never broke
I'm never broke
Baby crevice was tight like a pair of vice grips
I looked at pop and said ""You must got a lil' dick""
Havin' shame he was cryin' like a toddler
Nigga couldn't stand here baby scream and holler
I said ""You got one mo' time nigga where is the minl""
He said ""It's in the den right corner, top vent""
Folks remember that I'm scandalous and anti-fuckless
I carry diseases such as herpes and nut pluckers
Nutted in the bitch, kissed her on her lips
Made her get up and suck a little dick
The bitch had her some play though
Ya know she deep throat my big ol'
I dropped my strap like a sucker would
She said ""How does it feel"" I said ""Good""
She said ""You know this ain't the way to mix business with pleasure""
I said ""I know this ain't the weather to make miserable pleasure""
You know this ain't the weather to mix business and pleasure
Shit, she tried to bite off my pecker
Helped rex loose, I hangin' juice
And after juice you beggin' for this shit
Like you gon' knock it out better
Picked up my tech up off the ground
Pistol whipped, tied up sittin' down
I need a black screwdriver but a butter knife will do
To the vent I went to collect all my due
Struck out the side of boss game steward
Hopped in my hoo-ride made a left on Newark
Through the dark alleys black this black that
As long as I got me a strap look I'm never broke, yeah
I'm never broke
(Talking)
Oh I see
So what you're saying is a girl
Is something like an investment
Keep your revenues up to par
And all you need is a strap
Precisely that's how motherfuckers make them fat lick-backs
See I'm way respected in the rap industry
'Cause I skip, spit that real-life type shit
Feel it, so let's hustle up the true motherfuckers
Apart from the tarp
And the motherfuckin' good from the not huh"

Gotta represent Cali and bang till death do us
Throwin' the haters off and keep our folks next to us
For me to bust a Bay bitch she gotta be the thickest

Pop a collar one time, let me know you're still timin

I'm a Bay nigga, all in L.A. nigga
No matter what you say nigga, long as you pay nigga
I figure - you want it bad enough, you gon' take yo' shit
A steel toe mack down to break yo' bitch
And she cain't be fixed, so what if she yours?
We turn housewifes to everyday whores
Send 'em up in stores with the false ID
To get DVD's and big screen TV's
Wanna be like me? I run from vice
Catch a out-of-towner and I'm takin' his ice
Throw him in the trunk with the bag and the mice
I know it ain't nice but nigga that's life
Black black on the scratch, no tradin back

Here I come... steppin out the Vader
They call me D-Shot and I'm about my paper
Been in this game since eighty-six
One of the first bosses to hit the independent lick
Y'all know my dawgs is the C-L-I-C-K
Them true boss ballers that done paved the way
I throw my Roley up in the air
It cost me 25 K, do you think I care?
I rolls bodies, as thick as you can get 'em
You know them 600's with the V-12 emblems?
The rap game's been good to me
I like the money and the hoes and the V.I.P.
The lavish lifestyle that I live
Consist of big-ass parties and sippin gin
We puff trees, we smoke 'em by the ounce
We hit the studio and then bounce
(E-40)
See I'ma, street walker, gun clapper
Papered up hood nigga livin' like a rapper
If you see me you would think I sold a million copy
Like what's-her-name? Ice all on my body
All kind of bitches be thumpin over a motherfucker for the worst
One of 'em got a pair of ?? school college scissors in her purse
Ready to take off on a nig', take a nig' (beatch)
Stab a bitch, shoot a nigga for her nig'
See I'm a slick talkin' boss playa
Full of straight mindgames and schemes
Find your botch's weakness, get off in her jeans
Tell her she's the sweetest, pull her mental file
See if I can help 'cause she's livin' in denial (bitch)
You liable to find me on the ave, slangin o's
Parked on the curb, sippin white Irish ross
Smokin' herb, grindin in my dirty clothes (what else?)
Hella perved, standin on my P's and toes
(Suga-T)
I'm sportin Benzes, Cutlasses, smoke trees and hustle for G's
Pop game that pertain to plenty, shoppin' sprees
Magic shows, gatherings and ceremonies
What's your testimony? Ain't nuttin 'bout me phony
I'm a boss bitch botch
Known for smugglin heroin balloons in my crotch
Beat a bitch down with copper pennies in a sock, I be on the block
Teasin on the dicks, doin' nigga shit

Bust you wit the Mac
Never trust you wit the sack

Dead presidents and pesos
Stack money and I chase hoes

Been a crook

My occupation, this is how I make my livin'
I get harassed mostly everywhere I go
Can do my thing without a motherfuckin' popo
All up in my mix, 'cause I'm tryin' to maintain
And get a grip light weight fame
Born and raised in tha valley south Vallejo

Sucker motherfuckers wanna knock me of my feet
But Imma keep on steppin' and gettin' bigger

I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga, just down for my riches
Not to long ago I'm off to the bank to cash my cheque
The lady teller wouldn't give me no damn respect
She started acting hella snotty, kinda prejudiced
I guess she didn't like the way that a nigga was dressed
Before I could even get my foot in the door, right
The bitch already had a brother like me stereo-typed
Ready to push the button with no delay
I said wait a minute, baby, you mistakin' me for Andre
I'm not a ... rat head wanna be

I try not to trip when kids parents be sweating me
18 and over, that's what you gotta be
To purchase my tape and make sure you got I.D.
That's all I can say so mommy and daddy need to peep
It ain't my fault the kids dump it off the streets
They hear it at school, walkin' home and everywhere they go
And most of the violence come from movies on HBO
The shit that I be spittin' is real 'cause I'm real see
I'm out to make a meal, do you feel me
Holdin' my own 'cause I'm grown and intelligent

Rubbin lotion all on her gluteus maximus

I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on
Trying not to feel this pain no more
That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro
And drinking this Henney straight
Trying not to feel this pain no more
(Verse 1: E-40)
I came from the bottom of the barrel, to everyday new apparel
From a shoe string budget to more jewelry than a pharaoh
Up out a place called Vallejo, house smaller than a hut
First city in California to go bankrupt
Came a long way, let the truth be told
Penitentiary chances sweating over the stove
Seen them come and go, I'm the last of my crop
Don't compare me to nobody unless you're talking bout Pac
Just trying to survive and stay alive, so many of my people done died
Nowadays, you're an O.G. if you live to be 25
My partner in there with his grand-daddy doing 25
Lifting water bags, doing burpees exercise
I hand pick my friends cause people ain't trustable
Feelings like broads, their motives is questionable
Suckers sneak diss me and call me up on the phone
They say, '40 Water, I just wanna be on'
I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on
Trying not to feel this pain no more
That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro
And drinking this Henney straight
Trying not to feel this pain no more
(Verse 2: Game)
They say money makes the world go round
And since I'm worth twenty mil, I wanna see this bitch spin like the rims on a schwinn
Hop on that bike, ride through the neighborhood
Compton on smash, them boys get Cash Money like Baby do
I got a scar over my heart, cause that's what hating'll do
So watch your back like a tattoo artist
A coffin don't fuck about who the hardest
You lay where the people who mourn pray
Get your name etched in stones with your born day
Small talk over a glass of Grand Marnier
As I sip from the glass, my mind starts packing this Louis Vuitton bag
Take a trip to the past, hear that shot going blast
See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arms
Can't you see he got a piss bag
17 years old, and you niggaz wonder why I'm so cold
I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on
Trying not to feel this pain no more
That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro
And drinking this Henney straight
Trying not to feel this pain no more

Let me get a fifth of some brandy, a plate of some candy
Cindy, Sandy, Mindy Mandy
Tina, Brandy, Keisha, Angie
Man we, can't we all get along
Two shots of Patron, I did it till the break of dawn
Big fish in a pond, running my triathlon
Doggy Dogg keep the bone
One of a kind, blow you mind
Just like Einstein, born to shine
I'm getting mine prime time like 21
Get 'er done, everything in my life, I make it look like fun
Everyday of my life, I'm trying get my buzz on
Cause on some other shit, I'm keeping it on the under bitch
So much pain I overcame, same thang
Me, E-40, and Game came from the same gang
But you wouldn't understand
I'm populating with my? 's translation
That's my main man, let me hit that damn thang
I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on

But if she want tonight, she come with dollars
She either holler, or pop a nigga collar
I'm fresh up out that Coupe de Ville
Four times gold on my vogue wheels
Big sunroof with the insides ill
Gotta give it to the boy he got skills
[E-40] Made a mill'.. uh-huh, HOE BEATCH!
(D-Shot)
(Pop ya collar!) I done stepped on in
(Pop ya collar!) Now can I come up?
All these freaks hang out at the dump
Me and my dogs got this party on pump
All the hoes look like they wanna hump
I'm bout to pull a lil' lightweight stunt
(E-40)
On a mizznission about that cut
Rough, buck, smokin' on a blizznut
Ticked, pucked, ?? ?? was loc'd
Dick, Van Dyke, all up in her truck
Lick, at night, E-Feezy ain't no punk
Gobble, swallow, get her hella drunk
40 ounce bizznottle, till I tr-uh-Trump
Tip, hollow, mizzmillimeter thump
Feels no sinorrow for a sucka sap chump
Ya underdig? Yeah just
Y'know just tug on your lil' shirt
Pull it a lil' bit
(E-40 over Chorus)
That's what we do out this way... twice!
Dipped in ice...
Where? Made a mill'

Uh-huh... Northstar

Where this at? You made a WHAT?

120,Practice Lookin' Hard,1994,The Mail Man (1994),Hip Hop,E-40,"Bloody murder, crime, drugs, folks smokin'
Man I remember when it used to be cool to leave ya screen door open
And let the mosquitos and the flies sneak in
Look mama and them play whistle
So I'ma play tackle football with my friends
I guess them times is gone cause like a wishbone
I wish I had em' back instead of watchin' brothers fiz-all
Catch em' out on every track, bar, street, boulevards
Sweet avenues with dead ends, neighborhoods with antens
Whatever happened to the days of Little League?
Pop Warner and Boy Scouts, the Old Singing Boys Club
Voodoo to go to school not thinkin'
Too busy smokin' weed, sellin' dope and drinkin'
I guess we're livin' in the last days
'Cause in the last days the Bible speaks of AIDS
Plagues, brothers killin' brothers, earthquakes
Youngsters tryin' to earn stripes is it worth this?
I'll be a sucker if I don't pull ya ho card
I used to be soft but now I'm hard
I'll be a sucker if I don't pull ya ho card
F**kin' nigga, I practice lookin' hard
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Mirror, mirror make the call
Who's the hardest of them all
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Right before I go to bed
I make sure that my mirror's there
Take yo mean face off partner why ya muggin' me
Fools say shit, I can't help that shit's in me
It's automatic 'cause what's mine ain't even took
 It's my mad at the world look
I said I feel ya man, sometimes I catch myself too
Mean muggin' folks that did no harm to me or my crew
But now it shouldn't have to be this way
Fools say, I don't care what nobody say
The other man got me this way
I'm fresh out the Benz and out the system for years
Been fillin' out all kinds of applications to make a grip
But I don't know nothin' about no computer chip
It takes that to make a J-O-B in '93
But a J-O-B in '93 consists of paper rarely
Jobs like the oil refinery
I'd rather work in Napa at the winery
And then ya wonder why I'm stubborn
Forever lookin' hard, I been scarred
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Mirror, mirror make the call
Who's the hardest of them all
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Right before I go to bed
I make sure that my mirror's there
Can't tell me shit, I come from a broken up home
Every since I was a youth I thought that I was grown
Meet me after school nigga and we can get it on
Ya talked about my mammy now I'm goin' upside ya dome
I got a complex problem, my guard stay up
I'm always on the offense side, don't test my nuts
I'm not a Charles nor a Larry but I'm scary
Scared that I might lose it and chop you with my piece berry
I deep into my shit and it's straight like that
I be quick to clobber a motherf**ker with my Flintstone bat
Nobody likes me on my father's side of the family
They can't stand me 'cause they think that I'm sellin' the candy
I kid you not, all bullshit to the side
I got 20,000 niggas in my organization
Now which one of y'all niggas down to ride
I gets juiced off the underground doja
You know that Click shit, that independent shit
It makes me feel like I want to
Got me a baggy full of broccoli and a crooked eyes .22
I feel crafty, I mean that but I feel great
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Right before I go to bed
I make sure that my mirror's there
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard
Mirror, mirror make the call
Who's the hardest of 'em all
Aw yeah, block busta
Block busta

I practice lookin' hard"
121,Pray for Me,2008,The Ball Street Journal (2008),Hip Hop,E-40,"I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so
(Pray for me)
I've done a few things that just ain't right so
(Pray for me)
What I've been through would make you cry so
(Pray for me, pray for me)
I'm trying to change my life so
(Pray for me)
Ain't no dope on the streets, mayne, I'm behind in my rent
I ain't got nothing to show for all the fedi that I done spent
I told my mom to cash out my life insurance policy, the money
She been planning on using to bury me
My ribs touching, my paper struggling, mayne
All my life I been hustling, running in place
But can't seem to finish the race
Seen dudes get whopped in the face
Get plucked like a bass, flew in the space for senselessness
That's why I stayed prayed up and say my grace
Even when I'm blended
Never know when your life is suspended
God can take his arms from around you and easily end it
At any time, any place, any where
I know my life has been spared on several occasions
Suckas hating, I'm still here
How come loved ones fall out and never talk again to each other
Why does it take a funeral to bring a family together?
Bad weather always looks worse through a window
Stressing and rubbing my temples
I make it look easy but it's really not all that simple
I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so

Young dude full of soul food, mama cooking pork chops
Uncle slapping dominos, sister playing hop scotch
And this was before the block got hot and infected
And everybody knew my grand daddy well respected, check it
Time went on and the game kicked in
I was losing comrades either death or the penn
I was losing comrades but I'm stacking them ends
We ever go to 600, we losing our friends
When grand mama passed that's when it all went bad
Aunties don't talk, my cousins fighting its bad
In the snow Thanksgiving is like the ones we had and it's sad
So I express through a pen and a pad
I'm on my third wind pimpin' and knowing Jesus is with me
Ain't no weapon form against me, back in common defeating
I've been posted in the cut when them angels come get me
Until that day, homie, just pray for me
I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so

I've done a few things that just ain't right so

What I've been through would make you cry so

(Pray for me)
My kinfolk, babymomma on welfare, they house is bigger than ours
'Cause they got section 8 vouchers, W.I.C. and benefit cards
My home girl daughter diabetic, she like to eat a whole lot
She only 9 and a half and taking insulin shots
My dude got a heart condition, his ankles be swollen
'Cause he got high blood pressure and he refuse to quit smoking
But I'm no better than y'all, I like to drink alcohol
Break out the pen and start writing about the things that I saw
Like kilo grams of that raw and uncut Peruvian flake
Wrapped in aluminum foil and duck tape
Bust open and throwed in the pot, foamy and mushy
Melted and locked in a shape of a gigantic size white cookie
Put on the towel to dry and broken down into zips
Quarters and half of 16's and yola get flipped
I maintain my faith in G O D 'cause it's just a test
Repent, we confess, extra gratefulness, yes, I'm blessed
I've seen a lot pain since I was a child so

I've done a few things that just ain't right so

I need y'all to take this, I need y'all to take this pain away

I'm trying, feels like I'm dying

The quarterback...

Tell the cops don't read into it
Them days of slangin' yay been finished, them days have been done ended
So far gone them days that I'm offended
Snitches can't speak my name till they get winded
Can't you tell there's been a switch made?
Now fellas decide that they wanna run and tell like in the fifth grade
But I'm too gone, young'n be clear
Even when you see me, I am not really there
And I ain't play fair wit' my eye on the enemy
Huggin' the block just me and my mini-me
Did it and lived it, grinded here
Cops fillin' wit' my projects find it yeah
Not only was I in the game, I was gifted in it
Served food to the fiends and we called 'em dinners
Put the raw wit' the fake out, mixed it in it
Can't explain the cat's hustle, guess it just was in
It's Malicious
(Chorus - E-40)
If you got the turf crackin' and ya money's stackin', ya
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'
Leader of the squad and your the team captain
Quaterbackin', Quarterbackin'
Gotta little change and ya drivin' a range
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'
If ya sound system bangs, and ya pushin' them thangs
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'

Might not know what I'm talkin' about
If you ain't never lived it, or seen it, or done it
Seen fiends vomit, green stuff I had to clean it up wit' comet
Mean stuff, so many deaths my streets is haunted
Believe us, you shoulda seen us, like Wile E. Coyote, man super genius
Against all odds like Serena and Venus
I only had a couple jobs in my life, but not too many thought I was grown
Who woulda thought I'd sell my skill for a microphone
And be rappin' about it up in the song, slidin' on some chrome
It's long money I earn, I'm bald headed, but I used to have a lord Jesus perm
When my name was earl before the rap game
Runnin' from secret squirrel, I had my own thang
Raised by wolves, hyenas, and barracudas, gorillas and bulls
(Pusha T)
I play the field like Vick, from endzone to endzone
Serve that ish like snowcones in the hood
Entrenched in the gutter, I was lost in the good
'Cause I make the gat stutta like a old G should
Mamas lookin', so much snookin'
Nights in the kitchen thought I'd never finish cookin'
Way before pay for this that I'm mouthin'
19 years young, upward of 80 thousand
Trust me young'n Pusha was never browsin' for nothin' section 8 housin'
I'm stompin' through like King Kong claimin' his home, his jungle
Mumblers beware the hood hates singers
I connect, block the corner like Jenga, fall never, you seen 'em
Posted in the hood leanin' fiends like the Tower of Pisa
Damn he's good...

Love the way you players ball
Everyday you're at the mall
Tell me is it true or false
Say that you got it all
Love the way you players ball
Claimin that your mail is tall
Tell me is it true or false
Verse One: E-40, Too $hort
I put my mack hand down ain't never been asound
I was havin' b-r-e-a-d way before this rap game nigga been town
Thought you theezy, for sheezy, niggaz 'member
Earl, Brat, and Denell dem boys from Vallel
At every light it's automatic, BURN RUBBER
See my folkers in the traffic, WHASSUP ERB
Follow that cab it got dope in it, uh
My potnah $hort got hoes in it
I'm always hearin rappers big ballin on they songs
I do that shit for real and you'll never say I'm wrong
S-500 straight sittin' on twenties
TV in the dash pimpin' hoes gettin' money
I'm Too $hort baby been down since the eighties
For the last eight years rode around in a Mercedes
Lexus, trucks, drop-Vette, Caddy
Bitches don't call me by my name they call me daddy
Verse Two: E-40, Too $hort
K-Ci $hort E-40 Fonzarelli
I'll probably never have long money like Ross Perilli
But shit we just want a hip
Don't want the whole plate
Don't put the two on the ten, don't ever perpetrate
Like a lot of these fools I see on TV
With the Armani Chanel Versus Versacci
Why motherfuckers can't be broke sometimes?
Sometimes it's cool to floss
But don't buy an eighty-five thousand dollar car
Before you buy a house
They always said I couldn't rap, I just say bitch
I guess the bitch, made me rich
And now you wanna call me hardcore
While I be steppin out the shower on a marble floor
I paid the IRS taxes send FedEx and faxes
This industry'll is like fuckin', fat bitches
All work and no play, I do it everyday
Anyway 'cause I gotta stay paid 40
Verse Three: E-40, Too $hort
We throw parties on big-ass boats, niggaz wrap they paper
Ultrafied all-inclusive trips, Montego Jamaica
Front row seats at the Ultimate Fights, shamrock and severin
Long expensive fuh-flights, up dere in the heavens
Fat ass royalty checks, fat ass cribs
Smokin' blunts and drinkin' brew on the blacony, barbecuin ribs
The more scrilla, the merrier
I represent the Ya area
I walk from Foothill and Paperscourt to Sixty-Seven MacArthur
To Freddie B house to make tapes with my potnah
Hit Arroyo Park, we had tapes for sale
Got a paper bag full of that, can't you tell
It's funky, everybody nod they head like this
I said bitch, and everybody read my lips
I got rich, suckin up the game from the O
And even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow
I survived 'cause I got mo', game than them
It came straight from the prostitutes, players, and pimps
It was my destiny, I came the same every time
So don't question me, I transfer the game in the rhymes
I'm not a freestyler, don't rap for free main
It's Paystyle on mine, 'cause I love money main
Landrovers and Toyota, Lexuses
Six-hundred feet twelve with them big ass motor Mercedeses
We don't be savin' hoes, bitches be savin' us
Bitch disrespect me in my car, bitch best to catch the bus
I keep a briefcase full of game, while y'all be ear-hustlin
Ain't no paperback pimpin' nigga, we ain't strugglin
Verse Four: Too $hort
I'm Shorty the Pimp, I come funky
Again and again, they say when will it end?
Maybe never, 'cause I can still spit it
But I ain't rappin' for cheese, I want meal tickets
Gotta start somewhere, and I'm past that
For the right scratch, I be the last mack
So stick yaself Pretty Tony
You tryin' ta make a hit, but your shit sounds phony
Not like AT&T but like ET
You can't be me, so would you please see
If you can keep my name out your mouth
Cause you don't really know what the game's all about
It's bout feedin the family, not freakin in the Benz
Instead of rentin, pay for that roof on your head
And stop pimpin' in your mind knowin' you a trick
Put your hustle down playa go an hit you a lick

Hard type or soft, line 'em up chalk 'em up as a loss
See me in the parking lot doing my thang (yeah)
Love to see my old school dance in the rain (kick it)
The po-po's came then they closed up shop (kick it)
Smashed through the Hood and we made that hot (yah)
See the shit don't stop (stop) motherfuckers pop (pop)
Seven-deuce drop (drop) Coney air shocks (mmhmm)
Riding through the shit like Racer X
And if a motherfucker flex break back and necks (back and necks)
Running red lights and the right-of-ways
(How we gonna get it doe?) We get it sideaways, beitch!
Chorus: Mac Shon

Changin gears, super size
Poppin' wheelies in my, brand new ride

Glow in the dark night vision, solar ray tinted glass
Power heated side through mirrors, drop back airbags
Off the new with the stump
My Cadillac DTS Deville 32 valve ain't no punk
Get up outta here some ol' jacklin ass square
Hollered adjitudes and ate the gravel
I said I ain't no mark-ass any ol' rapper
Potnah I was built for battle
And about all that ol' jaw-jackin you doin' potnah I ain't playin'
You get your head put on flat, think it's a game

Screwed a few, bitches in my car

In game we trust, keep it on the low mayne
Live one rule no names discussed
Real hogs makin' noise in the game is us

On the Cooking Channel
Today we're gonna be making crack
First take 36 ounces of coke

Next step to make them boulders add baking soda
If the flame is low then turn it up and stir it up
Finally, just wait till it gets hard
Then bag it up, you got a key
Homie, that's the recipe, that's the recipe
That's the recipe

Before you decide to elect yourself in the game of dope
Better know that it is cut throat
Can't be cracking under pressure when your backed in a corner
Against the ropes
They ain't calling it snitching no more
They calling it telling the truth
They say you better get down first
Before they decide to get down on you
Mixing it up, Shake and bake
Its 2008, they got more data than '88
We used to make crazy cake, flipping weight
Got get in and out before it be too late
I don't want to be 6 feet under
So I pack and tote my thunder
Suckas want to hate and block my thunder
'Cause I got more kicks than a punter
Murder rates go up in the summer
Killers go hunting like a hunter

You can live good for 6 years
Then it's football numbers

Working with my hands like the maestro at the symphony

Sniff a liffy pisso nigga come and comprehend from me

Got a green skirt and I bought it off a recipe

Well it's Chef Boy A-Bun B, the king of the kitchen
I got exactly what you need to do your thing when your pitching
Guarantee to add a few layers of bling on your stitching
Big tittied in they chest get ta stinging and itching
Got to have the right ingredients before you can start
Like 1 part gangsterism and 1 part heart
2 parts of keeping it G then add to 100
Milligrams of a killer man and you then done it
Put it all inside a Cadillac on 3's and them 4's
Swang wide and mix scurrily while skating on vogues
Don't forget to shake them haters off homie that's a necessity

Y'all know us meth merchants, sherm stick or pies
Y'all know us sea serpents, makin' the grass, get full supplies
Little man complex, and if I ain't little
Then I'm big, and if I'm big then I got, big man complex
Love sex, took three of my botches welfare checks
Put a down payment on a brand new invisible diamond bezel
Oyster Perpetual Rolex
Bullet proof vest and armored like bricks
Sometimes you might find me drinkin' tap water
Up out the public park sinks
But most of the time it's Louis the Thirteenth, sixteen
Hundred dollars a pop, guzzle sip sip guzzle non-stop
Mo' candy than c it's coca leaves, flamboast and brag
Go on shoppin' sprees, and act bad
Never mind how much it cost, put it in the bag!
Bought a brand new Jag without, lookin' at the price tag
Fresh up out the box, bought a shit-load of guns
With my left-over cop money, pay cash all ones
Talk to me, I feed the dopefiends crumbs
It's monumental, when they let me use they rental
I'm a factor, livin' life, with mo' cheese
Than the Green Bay Packers, pay off the vice
Ain't never went out Blackwards
I'm engaged to this dope game, no swivel
We talked about gettin' out, but it's not official
When there's a drought we don't fret, we handle business
Nigga what you sweatin if you have scientizzic chemistes
That can make that shit and when they cook that shit
It's just like dinner
But cluckheads don't use forks and spoons
They use TV antennas
BAR-NONE, sucked up to nathin, heavy rotation
If it wasn't for some of that ""Tired of Being Stepped On"" shit
When I was locked up, I probably wouldn't have never made it
Splurgin, overspendin, doin' just a little bit too much
Puttin' the ? on a new 40 if I could do it all over again
I'd do it just like
I was locked up on a Friday, went to court on a Tuesday
Third strike victim, judge tried to do me
Lookin' at my folks on TV
""Nigga that's my nigga!"" In the day room
""VALLEJO NIGGA (watchin' BET) VALLEJO NIGGA!""
Sorry about your patnah, heard he took a fall
Up in here, we get the news before y'all
Now you know we ain't supposed to be talkin' on this kind of phones
Dude why you jaw jackin
Well what's the new thing? White collared crime computer hackin
Ticket scalpin, and dang near e'rybody that I know
Be tryin' to Charlie Hustle and get they paper
Sellin cable box scramblers to bootleg bitches
Just tapes, I let my boys drive my toys
Radar dectectors and po-po scanners makin' hella noise
Lookin' out for the Elroys"

I'm a real one, Ma!
Get rid of that clown, Get with a factor
Patna don't count, he a lame he don't matter
Shining like a big dipper, glowing like a star
Lookin' up a paw, pullin up in my car
Walked right up to the front where the bosses park at
I got a cold mouth piece can talk a chick out her check
Security loves me, let me in with no sweat
I see asian persuasion, aaucasian, all kinds of chicks
Milk skin, chocolate boned, lambs and Haitians
Tryna take me something home and have some relation

Back that thang up, baby press rewind

157,Where the Party At,1994,The Mail Man (1994),Hip Hop,E-40,"(Computer voice)
Where's the party at
Forget it man, I can't lie
I'm drunk as a skunk but I'm nothin' funk
I shoots the game, the gift I spit
The gift of gab boy, the gift is ripped
Deal with the skill that makes ya feel it
Those that don't wanna feel it need to kill it
Knows that I can giddy go
When it's time to get on the M-I-C-R-O-P-H-O-N-E
It's me the hustler 40
With them raggedy seperaters as if it was funky
A brother like me don't hang around no suckers that be faulty
I be puttin' the group up in the boot
Be puttin' the peas up in the pod
Left the cookies in the jar, now I'm a rap star
The rapologist, I pull a 40 out of my ball cap
Then I bust ya down side of this
Cause partner ain't never been no punk in this
I'm so serious brother, I got meals, wheels
And about seven thousand dollars worth of bills
Givin' up deals, hills let em' go for a lil' nothin'
As I showcase my skills for real
There's a party over here, a party over there
A party everywhere... put ya hands up
There's a party over here, a party over there
A party everywhere
Pullin' up in the club about eleven
I plays my feet and hit the beat and kept it revvin'
I got a lil' doja that I'm fixin' to break down
Roll em' up in a zag, lick em' stick em' and clown
I'm fully dig with a dick, my game is on hit
I got tipped so I tip 'cause I'm livin' with this
Game tight with the knack, I'm pullin' in scratch
They better have a tight grip on they stuff 'cause I'm bout to snatch
Your batch if she wants it she'll be mine in the Cutlass
Puffin' on some of this chronic while I'm gettin' straight laced
Heard about the drought season, they be lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feastin'
Extra manish how I'm livin' and my name is groupie
It's Mr. 30-30 givin' up game to all you hoochies
Bitches always splittin' stick the wood but sometimes wouldn't
Suckin' and grabbin' my little pecker
Talkin' about sick on my gold better
I remember when carts was Barbie cut before I was in junior high
All they wanted to do is kiss and let me play with they vagina
I got my freshen up, I put on my chucks, also down with pluck
Th finest watch on the playground, the one with the big ass butt
40 I love you, I miss you, I need you
And retrospect to who
Bitch come anew, bitch come anew
'Cause we made like thugs
Get juiced in the parking lot before we go up in the clubs
Hugs and kisses, gotta make sure we got our gloves
Hugs and kisses, E-40 can't be on any more
Hugs and kisses, straight to the bar no time to waste
Kickin' em' back while they take the place
Order me a shot of that liquor to taste
Thinkin' they about to beat my face
Oh no, I'm nothin' but a professional
Oh no, we're nothin' but professionals
Hoochies all in my face with some of that dope water
Brothers already purple off some of that soap water
So I'ma make a toast to the most
Mobbish lookin' brothers in this by midnight
Cause brothers gotta get the shit that's really in man
Batches on our jock, batches on our jock
Mind teachin' things to these brothers
Cause that's us, Captain Save a botch
They wanna be like big boys and sport big loot
They wanna be like big boys and sport fresh suits
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me
We in this baby boy swervin'
E-40 in the mob scene
And I'm still down with The C-L-I-C-K
Comin' yo way in the 94
Then 95, it don't stop boy ain't no jive
Sell the rest of them tapes boy
Where the deposit at, where mine at
Oh for real, I'm out
(Computer voice repeated to fade)
Where's the party at... Where's the party at
Where's the party at, where's the party at, where's the party at"

White gurl [8x] I got dat whiiiiite gurl [3x] girl girl [8x]
Ooh I throw tha yola in tha pot let it simmer 'n' bave
Add a lil bakin soda make it foam like after shave
I like to serve my dope wet 'cause it weigh a hella lot more
U can smell the residue 'n' the fumes from next do'
Turf superstar, microwaves 'n' pickle jars
Potrtable digital scales, custom painted muscle cars
Pimpin' where the razor blade? use a safety pin
What they goin' fo'? nigga wutchu trynna spend?
When it's a drought, I jus sit on my dope 'n' wait
For the prices to sky rocket and rise like real estate
I got dat icecream, that candy, that girl, that white white white
My christler charger 2006 hemi tight tight tight
I'm a d-boi (booch) I thought you knew
Jus like every other mother fucker in my crew
Bundle in the bushes, chop her up in the tree
Ak will light up ur chest like ET
(Juelz Santana)
Now let me introduce the world to my girl
She white, she bright, she shines like a pearl
And I ain't talkin' bout Lindsay Lohan
I'm talkin' bout that sniff, that blow man
That 1 hit that will get you open
Might make ur nose bleed if it's potaint
So if ur not ready, homie don't tamper with it
She da chick who had Tony Montana slippin
She so bad, she make you mad
But soon as you get that, she make you cash (that white girl)
But she ain't always that light, she ain't always that bright, she ain't always that white
Gimme 1 girl, I mean 1 gram
I'll teach you how to give a white girl a sun tan
Put it in that pot, till it get dat hot, then start tha Sir-Mix-Alot (ight)
Well down in the dirty... south to be exact
Gettin' money with white girls is a well known fact
I like 'em black, brown, puerto rican or asian
But nothin' bring the bread back like a caucasian
Weather winter fall summer or spring
The white gurls always down for doin' the damn thing
Put her on the highway, she ain't no punk
Gotta white girl drivin' with white gurls in the trunk
I ain't lyin' it's the best thing goin'
When my white gurls around it's always snowin
Mama can't stand her tellin' me to switch
Sayin' imma go to jail fuckin' with that white bitch
Always around to keep me paid
With some white girls on my team I got it made
So if ur down on ur luck 'n' got no money
Then do what I do go get u a snow bunny
I got the pirex workin with the white girl in it
It's the dope super bowl 'n' nigga I'm bout to win it
??
When we through with this badge we goin' out to the bahamas
I keep a silk braud wen I'm fuckin' wit the hard
'Cause the never get stopped my the motha fuckin' cops
Fools look hard but the bitches is fraud
Don't like to see me ball, want me to go rock from rock
Move around bitch you need to get out the way
I keep a young suzi when its time to move yay
U need to learn the game before you try to play
Like cab gone those laws will take you away
So I keep me a snow bunny ridin' in the front
With a triple zillion head in a platnum cup
U already know they eat nuts like a squrril
Lemme hit you in ur head 'n' bust nuts in ur curl white girl"
159,Why They Don't Fuck Wit Us,2002,Grit & Grind (2002),Hip Hop,E-40,"I use colorful words, you've probably heard
From somebody else's lyrics, but really it's my spit
I come from the streets, I'm not from the burbs
Although I stay in the burbs, I come from the streets
Money hungry hustlers tryin' to make ends meet
Stingy young brothas when we walk we sqeak
Have money, have street, have heart
I ain't tryin' to bunt, I'm trying to go out the park
I'm on deck, Sick Wid It Records I rep
I'm a vet but I spit like a youngster from the set
I ain't trippin', I knew it was political
They left us out 'tha Top 50, me and Mystikal
I rap fast but you can quote my rhymes
The greatest game spitter of all time
The most underrated rapper in the game
But everybody wanna use my slang
I don't know what they was thinkin'
When they thought what they was thinkin'
But they shouldn't have thought that
I've been a hustla since birth
So when the haul me off and put me up in that hearse
Remember this here verse, I did a song with Fred Durst
As far as the independent underground scene I was the first
To get a big deal, couple a mil and some mo
See that was some change, that was some scrilla back in '94
Playa been eatin off that bill for a while
Always dig me I never change my style
I gave it to ya raw and uncut, 75% of the words I made it up
You ask me why I speak the real way I feel
How come E-40 so groovy, and y'all so game goofy
Partly from the fact that I'm a force
They never put me on the cover of The Source
Next day, they can't trace the calls
I change numbers like a playa changes draw's
I'm havin' money, money long stretch like a bungee
When Easter comes around ask the Easter Bunny
(Easter Bunny do know E-40?)
Bet you that playa says ""That's the homie""
Ya likely to find me on the Ave, or on the main drag
Or on the corner sippin 'gnac out of a brown paper bag
I don't need no iron, I'm already creased
Enough game to sell sand to a beach
Enough game to sell a hooker to a priest
Enough game to sell Rickey Rock in Scotty's (??????)
I rap fast but you can quote my rhymes
The greates game spitter of all time
The most underrated rapper in the game
But everybody wanna use my slang"

I wonder what the fuck be wrong with these tricks
So me and 40 singin' this song for these tricks
You know them niggaz who call them hoes all day
At the hoe job all in the hoe face
As soon as the hoe tip off and get tipsy

And be home befo' fo', snuggled up witcha
Wake up and pretend to make love witcha

161,Yay Area,2006,My Ghetto Report Card (2006),Hip Hop,E-40,"Heavyweight, a vet not an amateur (What else?)
Looted up, I pushed pies like Marie Calendar (What you gonna do?)
Shoot it up if I must, take over shop
Get out the car and walk, sneak up on partner and do a dome-shot
Ka-pow, ka-pow, ka-pow, ka-pow, ooh
Then I blend into the crowd
... Hang with a bunch of hotheads, super hyphy and wild
Tell your batch to stop asking about a player
Get quiet about a player, can't fuck her right now, later
I'm busy getting my paper and riding around in my scraper
Interacting, networking and campaigning like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Like McCormick's, I'm seasoned, I run my reason (You run your reason)
Y'all think I'm starving, hell naw nigga, I'm eating (We eating)
They barking like Dino, lying and cheating
Keep jacking my lingo, one of these rappers gone end up leaking
Yay Area!
Like that, tell the people that 40 Water is back
We be to rap, what key be to lock (Key be to lock)
Cut a quarter or two and bend the block (Bend the block)
The West ain't been the same without Pac
So I, guess it's up to E-40 and Rick Rock, ooh
... Stunting... you hear 40 new shit, he on there coming
You hear 40 new shit, he on there dumping
Be all the women talk about, that nigga something, ooh (Where you born at?)
Born and raised in the Yay (Uh huh)
Got some folks in Lumpockets, Skeleton Bay
... Kilo grams I had to measure, finger on my heckler
Having more paper... than a paper shredder, ooh
Tycoon till I fall (Till I fall)... I don't sound like none of y'all (none of y'all)
You getting independent scratch (Uh huh), just remember the nigga that taught you that
Yay Area!
Like that, tell the people that 40 Water is back
Ooh, (Who you loyal to?) Loyal to my soil
Never leave the pound without my blessing oil (Uh huh)
'Cause I surround myself with felons (What they do?)
Pop inner-tubes and bust melons, ooh
... Hustlers... On the look-out for the racket-busters, on the look-out for the fools
The racket-busters mean them people, them folks, them undercovers
Never tell a batch what you up to (What she might do?)
'Cause one day she might tell on you (And what else?)
And you'll be sitting in the can (While she what?)
While she fucking on your friends (Uh huh)
Spending all your yaper (What else pimp?)
Riding round in your scraper (What she giving?)
Giving brains (Uh huh), all the hood homies run the choo-choo train
Yay Area!
Like that, tell the people that 40 Water is back"

That's the call of my thugs when they step into the club
They go Yeeeee! (Yeeeee)

They holla Yeeeee! (Yeeeee)
You can catch me in the traffic in the (?)
Hollerin' Yeeee! (Yeeee)
If you're stickin' like some static we gon' bust them automatics
Like Yeeee! (Yeeee)
(Verse 1 - E-40)
My area code grows some of the best weed in the world, my ninja, we ain't no punk
They say we need to take a bath in tomato juice 'cause we always smell like skunk
Sloppy drunk, nine times out of ten, I ain't tryna see me
Bendin' corners in my brand-new Dodge Durango Hemi
Pimpin' a lot of ballers, always smokin' mister jolly lama
Always pullin' me over and searchin' my fuckin' car
Searchin' my gluteus maximus, flashlight in my draws
Actin' like some batches is, thinkin' I got robbed
Doin' it big, take a swig, sip a sip, twist the lid
Smokin' spliff, already been, pushin red, bout my nig
Everybody wanna talk that talk, wanna walk that walk, wanna bark that bark
Everybody wanna plot that plot, wanna drop that saw on the pillowtop
I get a call from Young Bob, here up out my zone
He said your Hillside nigga Ned on his way home
I said well tell him to call me, I love his ass to death
Any nigga hatin' he gon' take they last breath
(Verse 2 - Too $hort)
(Biatch!)
It's your partner from the town, mayne
I see y'all doin' it big, we gettin' down mayne
Yeah I fuck with the V, Richmond know me
Wherever niggas ballin is where bitches gon' be
You can go across the bridge, fuckin' with a bitch
Don't matter which side, you'll be all up in some shit
Before you know it, it ain't like it used to be
Everybody got straps that shoot you or me
I give a fuck about who, I don't even know you
Wassup, yeah pimpin', I got my thang too
And it's cooo, 'cause I know you know it
I ain't even got a bullet, ain't even gotta show it
Don't blow it, it's where the black man stinkin'
I be layin' underground in a casket stinkin'
If I slip, I gotta keep my poise
You hear that 8 away bumpin' man, what's all that noise?
(Interlude - Budda)
Get your head busted in, I'm not your boy or your friend
Get your head busted in, I'm not your boy or your friend
You say that, do that, pull that, shoot that
Now where your crew at, what you gon' do now
I'm a west coast nigga - Yeeee! (Yeeeee)
I'm a east coast nigga - Yeeee! (Yeeeee)
I'm a down south nigga - Yeeee! (Yeeeee)

163,Zoom,1998,The Element of Surprise (1998),Hip Hop,E-40,"Uh, I come from nothin'
Come up, I come from nothin'
To get it crankin right here
Right here?
Turma-turmoil, torment and turmoil
Uh ooh
We been in bondage for years
For how long?
Trapped up in the ghetto
Yeah that's true
Dang, I got a dream though
Fiction
Tryin' to make my own progress
That's fictionary
(E-40)
ZOOM!
Even though the streets mob filthy, lights burned out (out)
Dopefiends die with antennas in they mouth
Niggaz are starvin, some of my niggaz is havin' they cash
Niggaz is ballin, parkin they car, all on the grass
Livin' it up to the fullest platinum colored jew-els and organized glass
Not none of that old fake ass costume jewelry, that looks like brass
I'm lookin' out the window while you play Nintendo
You drive a Navigator, I drive a Pinto
I was there, nothin' polite, me and my fools
The ghetto, field mice and rat drippings up in my shoes
A rebel, without a pause, commodes 'n' stars
No toilet tissue, dirty doodoo stains up in my draws
(Singers)
Ooh zoom, I like, to fly far away from here
Where my mind flows on, it's fresh and clear
And I, found a love, that I long to see
And people, who be, who they want to beeee, ho!
(E-40)
I never had, lobster in my life (or what?)
Or teriyaki steaks, just sardines and spam and cornflakes
Pacific Bell done put me on restriction once again
I can't call out, but you can call in
Can barely think straight, barely keep focus
My crackhead cousin spent the night (what we got) now we got roaches
(Damn!) Here lies my property, no composure
Six months behind on my mortgage, house under fo'closure
Momma ain't feelin' too good, she diabetic
Scared of needles hospitals ambulance paramedics
And I'm the oldest of fo', sleepin' on the flo'
Watchin TV channels we used to borrow cable from next do'
(Singers)
Ooh zoom, I like, to fly far away from here
Where my mind flows on, it's fresh and clear
And I, found a love, that I long to see
And people, who be, who they want
Who they want to beeee, yeah! HAHAHHHHHH!
(E-40)
I seen it in a dream, a big white home, looked like a office building
An old school Brougham with a sunroof ceiling
Thug living, sixty-four ounce of drinkin' thinkin'
""How could I come up, and purchase me a Lincoln?""
Drug dealin', leelin and dealin' tryin' to make a million
Blood spillin, driveby walk up to that nigga peel him
Back then I was blind, penetentiary chance at jail
Livin' off my gahl for hella long she worked at Taco Bell
And if the heater ain't workin and it's freezin cold
We open up the oven and turn on the stove
Survival, granddaddy's appreciation revival church
Of pentacostal, we raised money by givin' car washes
(Singers)
Ooh zoom, I like, to fly far away from here
Where my mind flows on, it's fresh and clear
And I, found a love, that I long to see
And people, who be, who they want
Who they want to beeee, yeah!
Iiiiiiii..."
