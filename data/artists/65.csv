0,All Your Fault,2017,No Shame (2017),,Hopsin,"I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me (ha-ha-ha)
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down
I've fallen, I'm crawlin'
It's all your fault
Mo' money, mo' problems it is
Now I'm back to writin' my lyrical novel again
I'm holdin' on grenades and I'm tryin' to not pull a pin
I done contemplated on downin' a bottle of gin
'Cause maybe that'll calm my nerves and get my ass on track
I'm on the fuckin' edge, I snapped and I just can't go back
I have no class, I'm cut from how my last ho act
She tried to ruin me, she damn near made my cash flow crash
I fuckin' hate this bitch, her name could sit on a grave
Only reason she ain't dead is 'cause my kid on the way
The bitch is pregnant and she strippin', dodgin' minimum wage
She done kick me down, locked me up and spit on my face
I bought a ring for this bitch just to set it in stone
My headache has grown, damn I shoulda left it alone
Now heaven is gone, so is my love and it won't return
Welcome to hell, bitch, I hope you burn, because-
I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me (ha-ha-ha)
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down
I've fallen, I'm crawlin'
It's all your fault
Listen, lil' nigga, we ain't in the same shoes
You ain't built a name or even paid dues
But damn it, I'm ashamed of what it came to
And if you had have ever reached my level of fame guaranteed Dame would have played you
He's in the wrong, don't give me hate for it
You know him better than me
Y'all always had a broken relationship
Now you lookin' at me like I'm Satan's spawn
But five years ago you had made the same diss song
Why don't you put it out?
Show the world you hate your brother too
Don't be afraid to show the truth
Shit, you ain't got much to lose
Anyone can hold a gun up, but who's brave enough to shoot?
You know damn well he's addicted to rakin' up the loot
If you seen the shit I seen, you woulda taken sides with me
But you fuckin' disappeared and you ain't even ride with me
And now you wanna return when the label hit the bottom
Nigga, fuck you and your phony mental problems!
I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me (ha-ha-ha)
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down
I've fallen, I'm crawlin'
It's all your fault
Too many motherfuckers judge my life
And make me out to be a monster like I love my strife
Too many motherfuckers pick at what the fuck I write
They hate to see me shine, they wish they could cut my light
I use my music as my public diary, it's what inspires me
It's why your fuckin' son admires me, come and fire me
Settle with the hell that I was put in, nuh-uh
You motherfuckers keep forgettin' I'm too good at my job
Y'all shoulda knew this, some think I'm too retarded and stupid
Overnight I just went and started a movement
The power at my fingertips is greater than Funk Volume and Ruthless
Ha ha, you still losin', you niggas thought you could do it
Go crawl in some sewage, you niggas ain't no entrepreneurs
You fucked with Hopsin Da Ruler and now I'm hollerin' screw ya
Hallelujah, all the deadweight is finally cut off
Niggas, the throne is mine, so stay the fuck off, 'cause-
I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me (ha-ha-ha)
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down
I've fallen, I'm crawlin'
It's all your fault
I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me (ha-ha-ha)
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down
I've fallen, I'm crawlin'
It's all your fault"
1,Baby's Daddy,2010,RAW (2010),,Hopsin,"Hey Marcus...
Uh, what's up?
Um, there's something I wanted to ask you...
Uh, what is it?
Will you do me a favor?
Oh no no no!
Marcus?
What?
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
Oh hell no!
Will you watch sponge bob with him
And teach him how to make a crabby patty?
Oh hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Will you still be down to get nasty?
Oh hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throws elbows!
Please?
No!
Please?
No!
Throw me the mic
I got a flow to recite
You got a baby by a nigga that you don't even like
A broke nigga who thuggish
Always be talkin' rubbish
Steady be causing ruckus
All because you were sluttish
Jesus, I can't believe this, freak shit!
That's the same motherfucker that you had cheated on me with!
I knew this would happen without a question
But you said
""I never have sex without protection""
Bitch please
You left me flowing down shits creek
You sex driven like a big freak
Plus our relationship has been breached
You took a big leap
And rumor has it you sucked his dick then kissed me
And now I'm suppose to be the father and the mental guide
Like sure I'll take care of the little guy
Shit, you ain't puttin' me through the stress
I put your baby in a pillow case and beat it to death
Marcus?
What?
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
Oh hell no!
Will you watch sponge bob with him
And teach him how to make a crabby patty?
Oh hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Will you still be down to get nasty?
Oh hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throws elbows!
Please?
No!
Please?
No!
I'm far from a fuckin' life saver
Not your friendly neighbor
But yet you called me during your labor
It's not my issue, take me off the menu
I'm not the one who put the motherfucker in you
I'm not a mean guy
I hate to sound that foul
But I don't give a fuck about that child
You damn right
See You chose him, then he fucked you
Tag you're it
Too bad his dick didn't have any insurance
You knew that he was just a lame nigga prior to it
Now your ass hittin me up thinking I would do it
Hoping we gonna spark it off like some lighter fluid
That's kinda stupid
Face the facts bitch your life is ruined
Don't be callin me like ""My life's a crazy blur
Rashad don't take care of the baby and makes me hurt
I wish me and you could go back to the way we were""
Shit we can
Just get rid of the baby first
Marcus?
What?
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
Oh hell no!
Will you watch sponge bob with him
And teach him how to make a crabby patty?
Oh hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Will you still be down to get nasty?
Oh hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throws elbows!
Please?
No!
Please?
No!
Now I won't be your baby's daddy
I'm not the one
But you can still give me some head
And maybe swallow some cum
And if you want it, then I can deliver quite clean
But don't ever send the baby to find me
Yo
Do you remember when I told you that I would love you forever
And broke up with my girlfriend Heather
Kicked her to the curb
And got with you
Thinkin' you were better
But found out you were a heart shredder
Yeah, I felt pretty stupid after that
Became the nigga that my crew was laughin' at
I was foolish, that's a fact
So this is karma
You've been on my shit list
So ha ha ha ha
That's what you get bitch
Marcus?
What?
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
Oh hell no!
Will you watch sponge bob with him
And teach him how to make a crabby patty?
Oh hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Will you still be down to get nasty?
Oh hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throws elbows!
Please?
No!
Please?
No!
Hey that's life
You fuck me over
He fucked you
You got pregnant
Now you're fucked
You had me
You had me, that's the funny thing about it
And you blew it
Ha ha ha"
2,Bad Manners Freestyle,2013,Knock Madness (2013),,Hopsin,"Uh, Hopsin
Yo
I've come to conclusion that life sucks
The only good that comes out of it is
Sticking my dick into nice butts
So if it's wetter than normal inside your wife's cunt
It's my nut I'll bust it inside of that ass and hasn't dried up (Ya)
I'm such a contradiction, I hang with Dizzy Wright
And all he does is smoke so when I'm breathing all the ganja gets in
Not to mention I'm condescending, my mind is missing
Plus I'm kinda sending the wrong signal
Oh god, I'm sickening
I'm not the one you wanna start shit with
I'm part animal, part dimwit
With bad manners like Bart Simpson
You Hollywood niggas who write songs
I give you a black eye
That's a good reason to put some ice on
I'm like a Jedi with the Obi-Wan bars
Lyrics are shocking just like a phony gun charge
My niggas we only fuck with the dopey blonde broads
We play 'em, and trade 'em like they were Pok√©mon cards
I excel in rap
It's 'cause I been through fucking hell and back
You ain't close to dope
It's just that everybody else is whack
Niggas getting jealous tryna diss me, Scary!
I'm an animal, fuck a Mink coat
Bitch wear me!
Yo all you rappers quit your bitching
Just sit and listen I'm the new sick edition
Of Pac this is the demolition
I'm so tired of all the reminiscing
So I'mma leave these niggas shook
Like my dick when I finish pissing
(Yo you fucking nasty dog.)
Get off me!
I love Christ but guarantee
You wouldn't wanna cross me
I'm as frustrating as lost keys
My sick mind's a good example
Of what the crooked law breeds
I'm trying to die as the greatest rapper
Shit I'm so hungry I could stick my fist
In a blender and drink it after
You climbing up then I'm gonna break the ladder
And you'll fall off so damn hard
That every bone in your face will shatter
Fuck these niggas, I'm a racist bastard
You hear the devil speaking in tongues
On this CD if you play it backwards
Tell your sister I can't wait to smash her
But I heard that her pussy stinks
So make sure that she fucking takes a bath first
I come second to none
My verbal weapon is perpetuous, and it's just as effective as guns
Gestures effectives as guns
You destined to plunge
Show me, I find it pleasant and fun
Like having sex with a nun
(What the heck have ya done!?)
Whoa. I'm known to hate
I use foul language to motivate
I know I'm dope, okay
But Hop ain't real
Was just a role I played
Earth, I don't know this place
But I just wanna stroll away
Into my homeless base
Wearing a pair of flying roller-blades
Eh, fuck"
3,Black Sheep,2017,No Shame (2017),,Hopsin,"And I act like I don't give a fuck
But I do give a fuck
And I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up
Maybe I'm thinkin' too much, and I'm caught in my feelings
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
Oh, I'm the black sheep
Fuck, a nigga just don't fit in
No one close to kin
I write about it so much, I done broke my pen
An' I'm so sick of pretending my life is dandy and flawless
I'm stuck on a road to hell, fighting demons
But I let 'em drag me across it
While everybody happily applauds it
Tell me what caused it
Was it Monroe High? That's where I went to school at
All the black kids said I was white-washed
An' the white kids said I was too black
When I skateboarded, I got booed at
At lunchtime, I was who they threw food at
I was trying so hard to cope with it
I wanted to run up on campus with two gats
And just (ah) let loose
Put some niggas in the E.R. for trynna treat me like a retard
Where the fuck does my future lie?
I can't see far, momma's little sweetheart
He developed an attitude, picked up a mic
That's a hell of an avenue
He gon' take your ass to hell and then back with you
Life is a class you can tell I've been absent to
My massive doubt has got me wrapped around
And it drags me down a bit
I don't know how to cast it out, I try to rap profound
So you could laugh about the shit
Truth is, yo, I never laughed
I'm looking for wherever heaven's at
The black sheep, they won't let him past
They would rather get together, tie him up
And then behead his ass, got me hella sad
Listen
Do you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?
Like the world is never gon' need you?
I always do, every day is d√©j√† vu for me
And I act like I don't give a fuck
But I do give a fuck
And I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up
Maybe I'm thinkin' too much, and I'm caught in my feelings
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
Oh, I'm the black sheep
That nigga whose brain is off, I am that
My train of thought left on Amtrak
I take the loss and I stand back
I can't play the cards with no hand clap
I can't recall when this damn crack
Became so overwhelming
I started to rebelling
I hate as all as I stand there
Never got no love for my niggas
No love no hoes, came up in a hole
Tryna climb out the devils dark lab, but the oven is closed
I don't ever leave the house much
I never really thought this would be the outcome
Wish I had a window I was leaping out from
My family is yelling ""Please Jesus help him!""
When I'm out in the real world
I feel like nobody knows me
What if this whole time I've had an issue and nobody told me
See this cold heart isn't cozy
And I be low part and I don't see
I'm so disconnected from earth
My hands are out so far but they won't reach
Should I get in a coffin
Not many niggas would wanna kick it with me unless they would gonna benefit off it
Motherfuckers never interested in knowing me
They just be just itchin' for Hopsin
I'd be fronting if I act like it isn't a problem
I done shed tears contemplating my suicide in my room isn't it awesome?
Fuck no
Do you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?
Like the world is never gon' need you?
I always do, every day is d√©j√† vu for me
And I act like I don't give a fuck
But I do give a fuck
And I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up
Maybe I'm thinkin' too much, and I'm caught in my feelings
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)

I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)

I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep"
4,Blood Energy Potion,2010,RAW (2010),,Hopsin,"In a world of mischief, we fiend for glory
The true satisfaction held within mankind lies in blood!
You don't wanna get ya head cracked?
When you see me coming through you better step back
I be crumpling on you niggas leaving you stuck up in the gutter with ya neck and your body ready to share that (blood)
I'm a beast in the night
Creepin' up on you to feast on your life
The demons inside
Are telling me to give you a reason to cry
And leave you to lie in (blood)
Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin' up on a stranger
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Give me your blood
You don't really wanna roam in the darkness (no)
You ain't ready for the pain and the harshness (no)
I'm zoning up to hop outside of my ride, at full speed, then swerve till the car flips (blood)
You dealin' with a maniac
See I know a couple of ways to scrap
I'mma raise the axe
Throw it at you while you're running away and when it hits, your brains will splat
So just face the facts
I'm a result of all the gangsta rap
I say shit, never take it back
I don't hate to brag
A true menace with a love of blood
You'll never get rid of my ways
Whatchu think of that, huh? (blood)
Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin' up on a stranger
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Give me your blood
Beat niggas till they have concussions (woah)
Rape wives and then laugh at husbands (woah)
And if you down with the mass destruction (what)
Toast to it with a glass of blood then (blood)
Pray to God for a night to start
I'm a psycho nigga finna top the charts
Being shot with darts till it stops your heart
And chopped apart and thrown up in a shopping cart
And pushed off a cliff, there's no alternate
Ending that involved with this, it's your fault I'm pissed
You're gonna suffer the consequences
You can not prevent this shit, I promise it, come on (blood)
Pretty clear that my brain's not there
I be looking for it when I shave my hair
Black is the color that I paint my lair
And the way I break niggas everyday is not fair
It's all because of the rage I bare
See I'm down for whatever, just say ""I dare""
My nut sack is the biggest so you niggas gonna have to murder me if you wanna take my pair (blood)
Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin' up on a stranger
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Give me your blood
You don't like me? Tune it out
I'm livin' life on the foolish route
When I hit the kitchen, I butcher you niggas into that drain slowly, but only when the moon is out
I get this way when my mood is down
Some even think that I'm rude and foul
Out of all the lovely children my mother gave birth to, I was the stupid child (blood)
Back in the day, when I was in elementary, I would chisel a pencil until it sharp as fuck
Leavin' the bullies laid out, on the playground
When they came round, yell ""fuck"" if you're raw as nuts, come on (fuck)
The sound of blood is so marvelous, stab a nigga in his stomach till you scar the gut
Hit 'em in the spine until you paralyze him and fill him with lighter fluid and go ahead and spark him up
And then abracadabra, am I missing brain cells? That doesn't matter
Makin' you scream makes me a happier rapper
You don't want trouble then your ass better back up
Fast little bastard (blood)
I was born as a natural hazard, I turn lives into massive disasters
Look over your shoulder when I'm in your area
You might get hit in the cranium with the back of a hammer (blood)"
5,Break It Down,2009,Gazing At The Moonlight (2009),,Hopsin,"Let's go
Break it down (down down down down...)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
Break it down (down down down down...)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
Now may I kick a flow for y'all
That's slow and raw
For niggas who thinking the west coast fell off
But first, I'd like to give a little toast to all
Who's souls was lost up in the rap flows in all (gee)
Back to my original topic
Fuck the bullshit you should be getting with Hopsin
On that real rap shit man forget the impostors
Y'all destroyed hip hop (good) Mission accomplished
Now I'm a make them regret this shit
Bringing back all the elements
Making these fellas swell up
And tell them that fucking hell is hit
I got to focus though
And come down on all my zoning's yo
Because I'm prone to blow
And destroy all my lyric chromosomes
I told you folks that it's over
So go and roll up your soldiers
And be out this bitch like hocus pocus
I'm so ferocious I had the potion but no one noticed
And now I'm about to blow up even bigger than my nose is
Break it down (down down down down...)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
Break it down (down down down down...)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
I'd like to bust another verse if I may
The mess I made, make rappers want to catch my fade
I'm just not sane, all y'all affect my brain
So don't be tryna run up puttin' me in headlocks mayne
It's like I pin 'em like a poster, get 'em and ya roast em
When it comes to this verbal abuses, do not approach him
I toast em, bury them in an oasis
Then write a book on how I did it like OJ did (stupid stupid)
I'm that new nigga all the kids gonna look up to
With a middle finger in the sky screaming ""Fuck school""
You don't want your child bumping Hop? Nigga fuck you
Who's a better dad? You or me? Let your son choose
Girl, why you acting so passionate?
You smiling at me like I was attracted to fat women
Shit, go dance your ass up in the cut with your big butt
Come to think about it, never mind I could use a nut
Break it down (down down down down...)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
Break it down (down down down down...)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
Still the same nigga, still using fruity loops
Play this shit up in the club, watch what her booty do
I ain't got to fuck with all the high tech shit
I keep the kitchen grimy cooking up my next hit
I guess it's how I was raised, and now I get paid
To go and write some bullshit a couple hours a day
I just pop a tune on and the music will move me
My message is deeper than this shit if you listen closely
Yo, I got a habit for smashing faggots
In fact I'm a dashing rapping savage
Assassin who has a passion
To just see 'em, read 'em, eat em
Beat em, flee 'em then feed 'em to Muselina
I seem to be the most heated speaker
I'll defeat your leader
Freak your diva then freaking leave her
Hopsin, he a demon
Y'all knowing he a beast (what!)
How the fuck am I supposed to act?
The west coast is back!
Break it down (down down down down...)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
Break it down (down down down down...)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what"
6,Bubblies,2009,Gazing At The Moonlight (2009),,Hopsin,"So? What can you do for our label Mr. Hopsin
Oh huh, well I got the bubblies
The Bubblies?
Well, yeah
Check it out
Yeah I'mma little out of it
I don't even really understand what the problem is
I think it's because I'm the man wit the hottest shit
Satan offer going if I can I demolish it
Then people noticing that's why my name bubblin'
They speak about Hop they like ""Nah, you can't fuck wit him""
You ain't up wit him these niggas just ain't touchin' him
You want him out the game distract to strait bustle him
I know it's necessary because I'm ahead of every
Upcomin MC and they don't wanna be secondary
So they sendin' these threat messages to me just to scare me
They see I'm very capable of bein' legendary
There's somethin' wrong wit me
I'm feelin' kinda ill don't fuck wit me (Yeah)
I think I might have the bubblies
(I got the bubblies)
Ooh, he's got the bubblies yeah
Bubblies (Yeah)
Yeah, bubblies (Yeah)
Yeah, bubblies (I got the bubblies)
He's got the bubblies
Like a fat man wit diarrhea problems
Who been takin' way too many bites of peach cobbler
If I get in the game yup I probably will rob em
""He's takin' over the world we gotta freakin' stop him!""
Listen up and listen good, only I can Stop me
I'm not gone stop me till my damn dick is iced and rocky
(Wow) And now you tryna defeat me, your styles sloppy
Then again if I was in yo shoes I would not be
Probably the same way, I'd run up on me and take fade
Then lie to the cops wit a strait face
Then right when you thinkin' that shit is just perfect
Hop would take it outta some rappers who didn't deserve it Just to make me feel better, send threatens and kill letters
To every rapper who I think is droppin' a ill record (Pow!)
I'm comin' you dumb if you not runnin', I'm gunnin'
OH! What's up wit my stomach?

Excuse me sir where's the restroom?
Excuse Me sir where's the restroom?
I have to use the restroom (Find the way, nigga!)
Eh, MCs tryna roll on the ponish
Just to boost up they career when they old and Corroded
I got plans don't be thinkin' that your flow will decode it
It's my spotlight and I ain't lettin go of the moment
And if you really feel you've had it, You want the mic so bad Well motha fucka I suggest you come and snatch it! (Ah)
Even if you did it wouldn't make a difference
'Cause the people you tryna attract ain't listenin
These bubbly wubblys suddenly buggin me
Stomach be rumblin mumblin when I have to confront MCs
It troubles me but the honeys be lovin' me
Some will be fiesty, but in the end I'mma feel on her double Ds
I'mma have to end this dang song pretty soon
And I ain't sayin' it just to be cool I really do
For real man, all my dang time is runnin' out
Oh too late, it's already comin' out!
There's somethin' wrong wit me

Yeah, yeah, bubblies
Huh, hah, ooh thank God yeah
Bubblies, haha"
7,Caught in the Rain,2013,Knock Madness (2013),,Hopsin,"Yeah
Soon after I dropped raw, the spotlight creeped up
I received love from fans through out the world, yeah, seems nuts
Is it God, or could it be luck?
I put my toes in the sand and ended up with my feet stuck
When the storm comes, then how should we address it?
My situation with ruthless turned out to be a blessing
During the time it left every ounce of me affected
But when it was done I saw that I was bound to be a legend
But I'm lost
The fame drivin' me crazy, cry when I'm angry, the games trying to change me
Sinister record labels got desires to pay me
As the world puts they fucking hands high to embrace me
How would you take it in?
I honestly can't pretend
The only reason I started rapping was to make a friend
And now I got fans who love me for creating sins
You think fame ain't got a dark side? Think again. Yo
Fame can make you insane! (It's so strange)
Everyday, I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know, who the hell I am
Yeah, scared I might never get a wife
Closer I move into the limelight shit is like
Girls just want to be next to me 'cause I rip the mic
Sayin' they love me, but the vibe I get isn't right
What if I flopped when my album dropped
And went broke baby tell me would your love just stop?
See I'm in love with you, but you in love with Hop
The struggle's real, but through your eyes it's fun to watch
I swear to God I used to fiend for it
I see the fire but I keep going
I smell the sins from the breeze blowin'
My crew is telling me to beast mode it
I feel like I'm going to hell if I keep it up even my priest knows it
So many women and the money is great
But this life just isn't me and I don't want to be fake
I didn't think that it would come to this day
It's time I put my alter ego to the side and leave him stuck in his grave
Fame can make you insane! (It's so strange)
Everyday, I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know, who the hell I am
Shit, not anymore
My soul's rotten and sore, I hear a knock at the door for real
I got a lot to endure
There ain't no stopping the storm, homie the top isn't warm so chill
I think I need my light bulb fixed
As of lately I ain't been getting hyped on shit
Life's a journey, you gotta find your niche
I'm leaving this tight space because I don't fit
Now I'm moving away, my whole life I'm a start from scratch
As an artist I'm trapped
Fuck Hop, Marcus is back
For a while, it's gonna be hard to adapt
But I'm willing to go through it, I ain't starving to rap
I'm soul searching
It's like I'm living with no purpose
I try to find a spark to spit but there's no urges
Inside of me for me to pursue it
Some people think that I'm stupid but don't judge if you ain't went through it
I'm out
Fame can make you insane! (It's so strange)
Everyday, I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know, who the hell I am
Fame can make you insane! (It's so strange)
Everyday, I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know, who the hell I am"
8,Chris Dolmeth,2009,Gazing At The Moonlight (2009),,Hopsin,"His name is Jesse, we kicked it since we was little kids
Throughout his life there's a bunch of stuff that he shouldn't have did
He was cool but there's a lot of stuff he could have fixed
But addicted to drugs is what I had thought he couldn't get
Until he had started hanging around them other kids
Who showed him how to drink a Corona and puff a cig
And introduced him to weed with added supplements
So whenever he was feeling down he'd take a couple hits
It ain't really bother me 'cause it was nothing big yo
It only bothered me when he started to fuck with crystal
I'm sure he knew that doing it wasn't a smart move
He'd walk around with humongous pupils like cartoons
I tried to tell him his life's goals'll be ruined
But he just told me to ""chill out"", he knows what he's doing
And now I'm thinking hard if I should get hostile
And said fuck it
And watched him take it right up his nostril
Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me
Eleventh grade where he's supposed to be
But he's in the ninth
He'd wake up for school feeling like it's the end of life
He'd hop off his bunk bed to go and sniff a line
A couple minutes later, now he's energized
He'd go to school and wide open's how he would get his eyelids
Then he'd get exited
'Cause he finished his assignments
Now it's big surprises from the teachers when they find it
Jessy's doing all his work
Well shit aight then
I guess it wasn't that bad after all that he did meth
It made him actually do his work, and not cheat on tests
It boosted up his confidence, he felt like he's the best
He'd stay up all fucking night like he don't need to rest
Until he had none left
Now he's acting strange
He couldn't buy anymore, 'cause he didn't have the change
So he sold his x-box and his whole rack of games
I never thought that the crystal could make him act this way
Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me
Jesse's sister walked inside of his room to get something out
Then she noticed Jessy on the bed foaming from his mouth
Now she's tearing up, scared as fuck
Oh he's done it now
So she picks up the phone gives 911 a dial
She tried to give him CPR, before the kid was lost
Then he had woke up and saw her on him and it pissed him off
All of sudden he went crazy just to fucking get her off
He threw her up against the wall so hard it made a picture fall
He can't really get a grip
She can't believe he did this shit
She kinda knew what made him flip
She yelled, it's drugs isn't it
And now the paramedics at the door
So she runs down to open it and they run up with all these antidotes
They tried to tackle him but he's too hard to handle though
They called for back-up
So the station sent another van to go
When they arrived he was spitting in their face and eyes
So they injected him until he had a stable mind
They told his sister that it's time for them to take a ride
You lucky that your brother made it
'Cause he almost died
She went up to say bye but he must have dozed off
And I had barely pulled up when the truck drove off
From our apartment buildings, so I didn't see crap
And I ain't get to see him till he got out of rehab
Even when he got out he was still depressed
Until he heard a little tiny voice in his head that said
Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me"
9,Crown Me,2015,Pound Syndrome (2015),,Hopsin,"Yo, let me take you to the tribe real quick
I'm from that small city called Panorama
Where the vatos roam and they blast they hammers
Never had no sense, so I'm bad with manners
Who'd've thought I'd be livin' life in the flashin' cameras?
Got bitches on my nuts like pubics (Ooh!)
Niggas could never figure me out like Rubik's (Cubes)
I be bullyin' everybody like I'm Brutus! (Who?)
So don't underestimate me, I do this, truest
I'm calm and ill but still drop bombs, I kill
You know the deal, with my godly skills
You wanna jog the field in my shoes? There's a lot to fill
It won't happen, you cannot be real
Man, there's so many rappers that wanna catch my fade
So many bitches that wanna snatch my brain
I'll probably end up on the news, dead, bullet in the head
Mama in the street yellin': ""That's my baby!""
You want me to keep it to a minimal with the syllables?
I think you should get up off my genitals
Every nigga identical when they spit a flow, this shit is critical
I'ma have to get rough and get all my sentinels
Nigga, what you be sippin' on? I'm guessin' your pen is broke
Is it difficult for you to get better? You're so despicable
'Cause your shit is boo-boo, your bars are predictable
I do not bump it, it's hard to get into you
Please admit it, man, the voyage is radical
Mind is set to just destroy, I'm an animal
Killin' shit, man, I'm a poisonous antidote
I be on it, man, your boy's international
Yeah, I'm mad with rhymes
Been doin' this since '99, I'm a mastermind
Homie, it's 2015, and all my niggas gon' kill it
When they finish the job, the other half is mine
Fool, you ain't on that real shit
I live here, you on a field trip
I'm made of shit you ain't built with
You a bitch, yo' girl need a real dick
It's no doubt niggas gon' feel this
You don't scare niggas, not even a little bit
I serve you, you get the bill quick
Crown me, I'm a real prince
Give me that crown boy! (Give it!)
I said ""Give me that shit!""
Give me that crown boy! (C'mon!)
I said ""Give me that shit!""
Give me that crown boy! (Give it!)
I said ""Give me that shit!""
Give me that crown boy! (C'mon!)
Give me that shit!
The rap game's mine, I revolve it 'round me
I think I have lost it, and my mind's exhausted
I'm nauseous from the process
Of hoppin' on stage and tryin' to dive in moshpits
Nigga, why you focused on diamonds?
These Cubic Zirconia's all up in my ear
Over jewelry, I don't get excited
My perception in life is ""Why the fuck am I here, nigga?""
I've been this way since your ass has been suckin' on titties
Since niggas cocked back and start bustin' on 50
Since J-Lo was mobbin' in public with Diddy
Since Biggie and Pac got shot up, it's a pity
That bullshit you're talkin', I'm not in the mood, bro
Continue yappin', you'll see Hopsin is brutal
Keep pushin' me, you gon' get dropped with some Judo
You fannin' out like you want cock in yo' culo
Niggas only in it for money and bitches
I don't even think they wanna rap no more
But they wanna be all over the television
Rockin' feminine shit, tryin' to act homo
Old bi-ass niggas can't bypass niggas
""I can't change even if I tried""-ass niggas
Tight jeans on so they show yo' ass-ass niggas
In the pool with the homie, tryin' to splash-ass niggas
Fruity as Mike and Ike, you'll get diced to rice
When I arrive I pull up like ""Hi! Surprise!""
It might be wise to hide when the nightly skies are high
Fuckin' with an ape; no 
Tell me, what position would the game be in
Without me havin' the ability to rape the pen?
, this is it, I'm weighin' in
I still hate y'all niggas and I can't pretend
Fool, you ain't on that real shit
I live here, you on a field trip
I'm made of shit you ain't built with
You a bitch, yo' girl need a real dick
It's no doubt niggas gon' feel this
You don't scare niggas, not even a little bit
I serve you, you get the bill quick
Crown me, I'm a real prince
Give me that crown boy! (Give it!)
I said ""Give me that shit!""
Give me that crown boy! (C'mon!)
I said ""Give me that shit!""
Give me that crown boy! (Give it!)
I said ""Give me that shit!""
Give me that crown boy! (C'mon!)
Give me that shit!"

11,Don't Trust 'Em,2009,Gazing At The Moonlight (2009),,Hopsin,"Hey yo, pass me a Kleenex before I lay this shit down
I can't believe this shit man
I tried to be a lover boy, little bitch broke my heart
Words of wisdom
Don't trust 'em
Don't you ever ever trust a ho
Don't trust 'em
Don't trust 'em
Don't you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
'Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin'
They'll slip behind in your service
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin'
What have I done to deserve this?
What happened to ""be honest with me and I'll be honest with you""
Your whole past Ms. Innocent I thought was the truth
Bitch had me felling ill on my knees barfing my food
I'm no longer the same nigga now; I'm heartless and rude
My homies said never trust a ho, but I casually ignored it
Till I got caught up in it, now I see the reason for it
But I had to be retarded, go and release my heart
I always thought that I'd bring the drama, never knew she would spark it'
That's just the way to learn, I go the tables turned
To get to my cold state of mind I had to make it burn
For pussy, one night stands is my only source
Fuck that love shit little bitch, I'm feelin' no remorse
Why should I? You had me acting like a fool
Trapped inside your loop because you're afraid to sacrifice the truth?
Come on, how many niggas you really fuck with?
How many time you really suck dick? Quit lyin' to me you dumb prick
Man don't trust 'em don't you ever ever trust a ho don't trust em
Don't you ever ever ever ever trust a ho
'Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin'
They'll slip behind in your service
Ooh ooh ooh the be lyin'
What have I done to deserve this?
I'll never find love, screw it, fuck it, been through enough shit
There's nothin' you bitches can do to go renew your justice
I'm too disgusted and I'm tired of being played with
You should have thought about all this pride in the occasion you fucked around
Thought for a while you were amazing till I got the pieces
And pilled up the equation
Had a nigga goin' in and out your crotch
Not knowin' this little skank done been around the block
A year later out the blue we having trust issues
After I already fell in love with you
Come to think of it the image does fit you
You fucked every nigga on the thug menu
And I'm the dumb kid who thinks he found his soul mate
He's blinded by the light till it goes dim
Now his hand is right beside a knife
A violent type of life is what society offers
Man, why even bother?
Just remember
Don't trust 'em, don't you ever ever trust a ho
Don't trust 'em don't trust 'em
Don't you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
'Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin'
They'll slip behind in your service
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin'
What have I done to deserve this?
They'll hide their colors from ones they wanna love
Even if you ask her, more than likely she ain't gonna tell
Been through this too many times, so take it from me, ooh take it from me!
Yo if you about to fall in love you need to think twice on it
'Cause girls are trifflin', they'll start lyin' when they invite you in
Have you feeling like the man; you think you found a keeper
Girls have said they love you; but when she say it, the sound is sweeter
You love is drowning deeper, now she's acting like she smoking pounds of reefer
Confessing that whole fuckin' town done beefed her
Then you like ""I left this bitch with my heart, she ripped it apart, I should have seen this from the start""
The shit you and her go and do it sounds nice
But the fact remains, you don't turn a ho into a housewife
That's what the fuck I did, and I regretted it, that's why I'm negative
No medicine could get rid of this
The next bitch who lies to me, watch me damage her
I'm pickin' her up and body slamin' her
And that's real, so if you think your girls a ho but you didn't witness it
Assume she's a ho, till proven innocent
And just remember
Don't trust 'em, don't you ever ever trust a ho
Don't trust 'em don't trust 'em
Don't you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
'Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin'
They'll slip behind in your service
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin'
What have I done to deserve this?
Fuck love. Don't hate me
Hate these lyin' ass bitches for making me make you hate me"
12,Dream Forever,2013,Knock Madness (2013),,Hopsin,"You're the only girl that never disrespected me
You always know how to bring out the best of me
Cupid shot us separately and then we came together, it was destiny
I love until there ain't no lovin' left in me, definitely
Our souls will ride together, even when the stars die
And when parted, my heart cries
It's angels like you, who make it hard why?
It's 'cause you beautiful, outgoing and smart, and shit you really set the bar high
All you bring to me is happy moments
You make me feel like I'm cute even though my face got all this acne on it
The way I feel for you, you can't revoke it
'Cause it changed me, and my family knows it
Damn, we both just kind of just fell into this
You gave me proof that heaven exists
But tell me, what is love without a headache or twist? You come taunting
Every night after twelve when I'm unconscious you never come out when the sun's watching
Baby, I need you
Where are you?
Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you (
)
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (
)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hopin' I find you
I wake up in the morning
With this sensational pain
It goes straight to the brain
Then my day is invaded with rain
Engraved in my veins is your name
This ain't gonna change
It is staying remain
Unless my heart is deflated and drained
Your love is magic, daydreaming about you is such a habit
Thought I saw you when I was driving, but I was stuck in traffic
If other girls flirt they're sadly mistaken
I tell em' scram, 'cause they need to know I'm happily taken
You see my love life, it wasn't going well till I found you
Fellas get jealous and doubtful when I tell em' about you
I know we had our fair share in the past, with selfish lust
But once we came together we sealed it and nailed it shut
Your touch is that of a goddess, when we kiss, I'm at a lack of words
Especially when we pull away, ad then you smile afterwards
In our hearts, we're no different in color, we live for each other
I'm glad you're my significant other, I love you
Where are you?
Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you
Baby it saddens me to know you only exist in dreams
I sit an theme for you when I'm awake
And it seems like I'll never be happy unless I sleep
I failed to see the point in living without you
It got me thinking death is sweet
I'll never know unless I leap
I guess I reach for the stars 'cause girl I'm in love with you oh so desperately
But I'm about to do is discreet
I rest the cheek on the pillow as I'm counting sheep
Take me to ecstasy
I tried to get you out my head, the pains a lot worse
I love you more than anything! I won't even put God first!
You're the reason that I sleep so often
I'm hurting the night I don't see you, I just keep on tossing and turning
I feel so lost and deserted, you made my life good
I told you if I had to take a bullet for you, I would
So baby here I go with the proof
This is it, the moment of truth, only for you
Where are you?
Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you
Where are you?
Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you"

Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga
Yeah, you behind if you don't know the power (nigga)
Product this shit the moment Ruthless started goin' sour (what?)
Niggas is sayin' fuck you to us, but we have spoke it louder
Now they come to us for advice in the game, they know it's ours (true)
Cause It's so hard just to survive in this era
We learn from trial and error, it's hard for cowards to bare us
They know the style is terror, nigga we everywhere
Yeezy and Hov ain't the only niggas that's wildin' in Paris
Back in the day, me and my nigga SwizZz was always in grind mode
Reppin' that 818 was just like walkin' that tightrope
We've seen rappers come and go and get lost in this cycle
So we had to fuckin' make sure we left all of your minds blown
SwizZz? He told me 'bout his brother Damien sayin' that he could create a structure for us
We're guaranteed to make a win
I said I'm in, let the games begin
So he introduced us, then after that
We plotted on some ways to make us trend, yeah

Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga
You see, I took a shot out of the glass of mischief
Made an album so raw the way you just had to get it, every track explicit
I figured those of you who was in love with rap would listen
And tell your parents that it's the one gift they should grab for Christmas
Then I blew up way faster than what I had predicted
It's like magic, isn't it, they love my language and graphic image
Some people thought Ruthless put me into a bad position
But I over came it and outshined 'em, I'm back up in it
2011, went on a nation wide tour
Came back and dropped that Ill Mind 4
That put me in a cool place, swiped up a million views in a few days
I celebrated inside of swimming pools sippin' Kool Aid
I shot a video with my nigga Tech and B.o.B
I went from feeling lonely to how does everyone know me?
2012, I made the XXL Freshman list
I knew that this fuckin' game was gon' be mine when I stepped in it
Come on, man
Y'all ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming
That's how I roll, dawg
The second niggas take they eyes off me
I leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg

Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga
I was online chillin', bloggin' and what not (okay)
I stumbled across this one nigga, reminded me of a young Pac (right)
I asked Dame if he heard of Dizzy he said, ""Come on Hop
I been bumpin' his shit before you, bruh, his songs hot.""
If he had that push, then so many doors'll become unlocked
He said we should sign him, I said that's a long shot
We flew him to Denver to see our show and said you fuck with this shit?
He said, ""Shit nigga, yiggity yamp, I'm up in this bitch.""
A few months later, one of the homies had stopped me
Asked if I had seen this raunchy, zombie filled, godly video, that's beyond beast
I said, ""probably, I don't know, who the fuck you speakin' 'bout?""
He showed me Skitzo by Jarren Benton, I started freakin' out!
I'm like, oh shit! I had to show SwizZz
And Dame and they both flipped, it's a trip, this nigga's so sick!
We had to put him on quick and blow this nigga up
Now we got a serious squad, the truth, it is nuts
Yo, I took the college route to figure out my path in life
Romp the UCI and that lead me right back behind the mic
I tried to make my dad proud, brother got his MBA
While I was wildin', takin' random classes tryna find my way
Junior year, I had to bounce not to blindly chasin' dream
Calculated riffs, I knew that I devised a perfect scheme
Hop was gazin' at the moonlight, I just hit the valley scene
Dame got rocked by the recession, then we formed the fuckin' team
F-U-N-K-V-O-L-U-M-E, nigga
Seven years into this shit, somehow we're only gettin' bigger
And we're just now gonna start the shit, I've been up out the picture
Dizzy, Hop, Jarren, and Hoppa stay confident I deliver
So I'm grateful for the chance and the position that I'm placed
Meet the aftermath, the aftermath, the Funk is in your face
Independent livin', we control every decision made
What up Dame? Prepare the reign, we killin' this thing, it won't stop, bitch!

Don't act like you don't know what time it is fool

14,Fly,2015,Pound Syndrome (2015),,Hopsin,"I was taught that education is the only way to make it
Then how'd I get so much money inside my savings?
My teachers never saw the heights that I was fuckin' aimin'
Did the man who invented college, go to college? Hmm, okay then
Am I the only one that noticed humans on the same shit?
Y'all thoughts are sailin' on the same ship
And if that's the case, then that's the reason that you ain't shit
Let me enlighten you my niggas, just let your brain drift
First of all, the best type of marketing, is marketing that doesn't feel like marketing
It makes the people feel like they a part of it
And when it's done right, corporations think it's marvelous
They feed us these ideas and then we place 'em in our hearts to sit
It's why players are good at gettin' chicks
It's why Nike is good at sellin' kicks
It's why Disney is loved by all the kids
Why McDonald's owners are super rich, we're too blinded to ever see 'em pitch
See when this happens we take our health, wealth, lives, and just hand them off
Thinkin' that we did this from organic thoughts
I know you seen parents trick kids with candy, toys, and Santa Claus
The same method is used to trap adults
But instead of candy it's with money, religion, drugs, and alcohol
Mention that shit and it's gon' arouse us all
I done seen niggas get into fights over cigarettes like a pack of dogs
They get you hooked and then they laugh at y'all
I really hate to break it to you but your life's bein' played with
You have not witnessed the world 'cause you stuck in the matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly
Man, can't you see we're robots who know not what we do an' we got no shot
In the real world until we climb out of this ice cold box
Your whole life has been part of a whole plot
To keep you at the bottom while they on top, stay quiet, then they won't stop
They always tryna show us what we don't got
They do it to all of us 'til we finally break and go cop a gold watch
Knowin' we need the cash for rent
My ass is sick just thinkin' about how rich and powerful all these bastards get
They package ideas like it's oxygen
They make us feel like if we ain't got it, we fucked and we cannot fit in
This fuckin' system is not your friend
And understand they controllin' your thoughts 'cause they got a lot to win
Niggas get turned away when I mention this
Ignorance is bliss but I don't give a fuck, I won't censor shit
The matrix is real an' you done entered it
It's way too intricate for you to ever realize it you fuckin' simpleton
I really hate to break it to you but your life's bein' played with
You have not witnessed the world 'cause you stuck in the matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly
Yo, fuck Hollywood, fuck all these reality shows
Making us feel lame unless we blowin' stacks on new clothes
Making us feel like we ain't cool unless we have a few hoes
Making us feel like we ugly, unless we have a new nose
I see naturally beautiful women get Botox, fake tits
Fake lips, they so brainwashed and it doesn't make sense
Focus on yo' life and the path you pursuin'
Cause y'all too busy worried about what Kim Kardashian's doin'
Check it, most of this shit that you sheep are watchin' on television
Is fake as fuck and is not real, I rebel against it
It's the Devil's business, they just reel y'all in
If they say it, we do it, yo, I'm tryna tell y'all man
The system created the stereotype for the Black image
That's why my people are scared to be different, why don't you get it?
I'm done practicin' these ridiculous rituals
It's time I become a real individual and just do me
I really hate to break it to you but your life's bein' played with
You have not witnessed the world 'cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly
Use your mind, be yourself
Don't be nobody else but you
You and the meaning of life has no rules, no rules, no rules
Fly away
Fly away
Fly, fly, away
Life's too short not to live it
The world is all yours, come get it
Just go and get it, it's beautiful"

You thought I was quittin', the joke's on you

Got the crown, I can't pass mine down
Demons in me, can't cast mine out
Nope
You can't forget me with the slashed eyebrows
Please excuse me when I'm at my prows

You'd better get ghost 'fore your head get pressed in (back up)
You rap niggas just a facade
You only do ten-percent of your job
Your producer is the only reason that they bumpin' your shit while they sit up and nod
Who the fuck you think you kiddin' bro?
You think you're fly because you gettin' dough?
If your label would stop paying radio stations to play you
You think we would feel it? No
That's just how it goes
Please do not get close, this is not a joke
Better be jottin' notes of my hottest quotes
Till your pockets swole, puto v√°monos (ay wey!)

16,Fort Collins,2015,Pound Syndrome (2015),,Hopsin,"Yeah, early 2014 I was on the Knock Madness tour
I was mad about it, I half-assed my album 'cause I really didn't know what I was rapping for
I was going through a break up and that was hard
I wasn't in my right mind, nigga that's for sure
Every night I was praying and I would ask the Lord
To please give me strength, so I don't slam the door on my fans
But no luck I was stuck
Even though a nigga had a plus size buzz
I didn't even know who the fuck I was
I tried so hard to see a plus side, but
I couldn't find the spark inside the dark
Even with my crew saying nice remarks
It felt like some darts were stuck inside my heart
I was thinking that a brand new life's the start
But I couldn't leave, I made a commitment
On my off time the fans invaded my business
So I started feeling a gang of resentment
Flipping on everybody when they ain't even did shit
I needed to go home and gather my thoughts
I didn't wanna suicide as the result
So the night at my Fort Collins show before I hit the stage
I left through the back for a walk and no one saw
I thought I was going up to the store to get a drink or somethin'
And a voice had told me to keep walking
And do not step foot on that stage for nothing
So I kept on walking
Then I camped out up in an abandoned house
I hated this rap shit and I hated my life
The spotlight does that when you can't get out
'Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please 'cause I don't know
I might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat
And I'm hoping that y'all can forgive me, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry

Don't know where I'm going tonight
Someone guide me to the light, please
I got a girl back home, yeah
God know she the sweetest thing on earth
I can't sleep on her
But there's too many women on tour and I try not to cheat on her
Man, my options for pussy are unrealistic
There's bitches who'd give up a lung for this dick
My music be leaving 'em sprung and twisted
The average nigga would have fun with this shit, that's real
Here is a secret, you don't have to keep it between you and I
Upcoming rappers who 'bout to be touring, I promise the road will eat you alive
But you know that shit when you rise
And by no surprise, I'm not gon' feed into the lies
No, I'm not gon' say that you wrong
But I'm not gon' say that you right, it's hard to keep quiet
When all I do is hold you down
If I ain't know you then, well I feel like I know you now
I know you had a little doubt, but to hop off stage and find out
You done walked out, and you not taking nobody calls
You don't wanna deal with it
But I'm looking at these fans like 'damn, there's a lot of y'all'
You got me tripping with the bodyguard
Like ""Nigga, how the fuck you lose the headliner?""
Now I don't care that you left the show
I just wish you woulda let me know
'Cause I don't know if you've been kidnapped
Or know somebody from the city where they live at
But, the way you went about it make it hard for me to feel bad
Honestly it made a nigga real mad
'Cause I'm texting you like, ""Hop the devil just testing you
And Fort Collins got respect for you""
And that's why the next day, you was like
'Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please 'cause I don't know
I might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat
And I'm hoping that y'all can forgive me, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry

17,Gazing At The Moonlight,2009,Gazing At The Moonlight (2009),,Hopsin,"Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to me
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh nananaaah
Gazing at the moonlight, devil comes close to me!
But mama told me never talk to strangers!
It's really hard to focus living in this world of sin
All balled up in a corner is what I wanna curl up in
So pearls 'n' Benz, money to spend, girls who's a ten
Fuck it baby, I promise ill never hurt you again
People fin to be the best, not the best they can be
I use to be the same way, I guess it's what Satan made of me
It's somethin' like slavery the way Lucifer has us
All this glamorous shit we like to use it to trap us
Then he smiles as we run loose on his campus
And dances circles around say you think it's fabulous
The glamorous, pay a price it's all hype, it's Satan
But in the mean time shit is all right
Most people think the message I send you is stupid
And y'all are gunna ignore and just continue to do it
But as long as I made an attempt to convince you this shit's cool
The rest of your destiny is within you
Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to me
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh nananaaah
Gazing at the moonlight, devil comes close to me!
But mama told me never talk to strangers!
I'd rather go broke than go and give my soul away
My coldest day couldn't add up to Satan's prodigy
He's tellin' me to jump but I'm sayin' I don't obey
They say your soul is not owned till your bloods on the page
And he don't have to own your soul for you to do his dirt
Hes a master of ceremonies and that's why music works
All it takes is one rapper to make it big then through him
Satan will have the nation creatin' sin and he wins
Then repeats the cycle over again
From many generations the time is close to the end
And all those times he was sayin' fuck it
You'll be hit with the day of judgement and burn as the devils naked puppet
Take it as odd flows or take it as gospel shit
I'm just speakin' the truth whether I make it or not, yo
You don't have to love just don't ever hate
And just know with Satan here this world will never be a better place
Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to me
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh nananaaah
Gazing at the moonlight, devil comes close to me!
But mama told me never talk to strangers!
So many times I have fell in this trap, I'm tellin' the facts
He makes it seem like hell isn't bad, till this day I still get influenced
And even tho I know it's sinnin' I'm willin' to do it my ass ain't even improvin'
'Cause it's so hard to stop what's been taught for so many years
If I think about it too much ill just be rollin' in tears
Sometimes I think why am I here, why do I feel
Like I'd be runnin' in fear if ever the end was near
It's like, sin is in so much of everyone's daily habits
That we don't even know we do it whenever it happens
Then it settles in like I should've never did that shit
I wanna enter the gate perfect rather than have this
If you had to turn your test in today
You think you would pass it or would you rest in the flames?
Who knows, there's only one way to find out and if you die now
There's no turnin' back, it's your life pal
Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to me
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh nananaaah
Gazing at the moonlight, devil comes close to me!
But mama told me never talk to strangers!"
18,Gimmie That Money,2013,Knock Madness (2013),,Hopsin,"Back when I was a young nigga playing in the sand
I had some big dreams so I made a little plan
You was out partying while I was thinking in advance
Try'n'a get right hoping that one day I'd be the man
The years went by I was M.I.A
I got rid of all of the niggas that was in my way
I saved nickels and quarters till I could afford a studio
To record and then get money off the shit I say
Then my dream came true and the fraud niggas came out
See me ballin' out they all we all gettin' paid now
Talking like ""Hopsin, oh you're a great pal""
Fuck you, stick my balls in your dang mouth
Now every other week you hit me up for money
Frontin' like you always been down (pow!)
But back then when a nigga was living bummy
Your ass was nowhere to be found (wow!)
Look my nigga (Marcus) I ain't tryin' to be one of ya fake ass goldigger
Homies that's not it (that's not what I'm doin')
But can I borrow 500 dollers I'mma pay ya ass back next week I promise (please)
I can't even make friends
'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money
They like let me have this
Let me have that
Let me have this and they keep on coming (man)
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money!
There was a chick I asked out back in '06
Made her a love song, and she was like ""No bitch""
Gave me the song back, and I was like ""Oh shit
I'm so stupid, I should've never wrote this""
She was a dime piece, top of the list
A Latin girl, and her skin had a tropical twist
She never used to call me, I always had to call her
And deep down inside it was making my heart hurt
So her life went on, she didn't even involve me
Then last year I ran into her in a Walgreens
She was like, ""Marcus, how are you? (oh my God)
You finally made it, I'm so proud of you""
So the next day she called me and asked to kick it
For the sake of the old me that was sad, I did it
Come to find out she was never that terrific
Especially a week later when she asked me this shit
""Hey um, Marcus, I really really hate to be a bother
But my rent is due, and I'm like broke as fuck
So can you please lend me 10 hundred dollars, please""
I can't even make friends
'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money
They like let me have this
Let me have that
Let me have this and they keep on coming (man)
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money!
Mmm-hmm
See my ex girl think she slick
Man let me tell ya how she tried to do me
She said she didn't have a vehicle to drive to work in
So she came and asked me for 2 Gs
And although I wasn't that concerned
She said her mom would pay me back, soon as she got her tax return
So I committed and did it, thinkin' she wouldn't forget it
But she forgot it, now my stomach got a nasty burn
I called her! And said, ""Bitch! Where my money?! You got that?!""
She said, ""Not yet, see my mom's mad
She said she isn't gonna pay, you can drop dead
'Cause I got into a fight with her, she's a hot head""
I'm like, ""That's between you two, not me!
What the hell does that have to do with my cheese!""
She said, ""Ok, ok, stop please
I swear I'll pay it all back Marcus, in five weeks""
Huh, five weeks huh?
It's been three months and I ain't even heard from her
Changed her damn number, shit
Bitch played me like a dumb motherfucker
I can't even make friends
'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money
They like let me have this
Let me have that
Let me have this and they keep on coming (man)
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money!
Give me that dough, Give me that money
Give me that cheese, Give me that money
Give me that yeah yeah yeah, Give me that money
Yeah yeah, Give me that money
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
Baby give me that yeah yeah yeah yeah
Give me that yeah yeah yeah yeah! Ha
This for the bitches that ooh
Fuck
I don't think I'm gonna be able to pay Marcus back
Ah"
19,Good Guys Get Left Behind,2013,Knock Madness (2013),,Hopsin,"I know I don't usually make love songs, but there's a few
Special girls who kind of changed my perspective on everything
And I feel like every guy comes to that point in his life
Where he changes from a boy into a man
So yo, this one is strictly for the ladies, only
See when I met your stupid ass up at the mall on accident
I thought you was the baddest chick I ever seen but that was so inaccurate
You stole my heart like you had done some magic trick
Your essence was so fabulous you also had a sexy look and rack of tits
I only had intentions to respect your ass and that was it
I took you for a walk under the moon, we joked and laughed a bit
The chemistry was there, right where we met I had to act on it
At that moment I knew you was the girlfriend that I had to get
What happened bitch? I swear you had me mad sprung
Our first time hanging I could've did more than I had done
But I didn't because I was nervous, in my heart, you had reserved a place
So sexing you just wasn't on my mind 'cause you were worth the wait
Shit got to a point where you started cancelling dates we made
Gave me crazy rage, you had me thinking you hate me, great
You vanished with no signs and I didn't even know why
Till I found out you had a fucking boyfriend this whole time
Why couldn't you just tell me?
You had me buying plane tickets to go see your stupid ass
Then you cancelled on me at the last minute talking about you busy
Bitch, I'm busier than you and I still make time for your bitch ass
Fuck you!
I should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)
Now I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now
Baby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you
'Cause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys
And good guys get left behind
I swear I'm sick of this, bein' stuck in predicaments
Gettin' the shitty end of the stick and it's never different
Hours spent on the phone as I'm listenin' to your jibberish
Blah-blah-blah your mind was scrambled I tried to configure it
I'm not one you should move past, these player guys, you choose that
To me, you're worth a lot more than what they had valued you as
Only reason they hollered was because you got a cute ass
They just want you for sex and then they move on to a new task
Your actions show your true class, I think you're moving too fast
Datin' these strangers can be dangerous, they rarely do last
But you just too blinded to see, just like a disease
The guy that you been lookin' for is more than likely me
But now I'm on some ""fuck you"" type shit
Your mind is so indecisive, bitch, cry
I'll no longer be ya tissue you can wipe with
You just triflin', you just screw so much
I'm thinkin' that you like it, my prediction on
Your future is always right, I must be psychic, damn
See, I ain't even tryna affiliate myself with stupid
People like you anymore, it's the same damn story with
You every single time, don't be callin' me talkin' 'bout
You fucked up, bitch, fuck you!
I should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)
Now I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now
Baby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you
'Cause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys
And good guys get left behind
That's just the way that the story goes
These damn bitches ain't nothing but clueless, horny hoes
They'll fill ya life up with drama like it's the Maury show
She'll turn her back on you even though she had sworn she won't
I never felt this sore before, here's what you do to be fair
You get a girl, fuck her while the opportunity is there, 'cause if you don't
Some other nigga will, best believe this shit is real &
When you find out what she's been doin' you'll fall and get the chills
Love is just a battlefield, some bitches be gettin' killed
Niggas too, it's the truth, better run and get your shit
Hoes will make ya think they at home waitin' for ya, sittin' still
But really, she's out with that guy you don't like and she's gettin' drilled
My heart is forever swollen, why'd I let you ever hold it?
Girl, you was my Bella and I thought I was your Edward Cullen
There's no rules to hop onto your boat, you'll take whatever floats it
Bitch, you turned my heart into a cave no one should ever go in
I can't stand these stupid bitches
Man, I just wanna take my hand
And put it around their fucking neck
And choke the fuck outta them! Ooh!
Fuck 'em all!
I should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)

Yup, just a normal day, on my favorite website, backpage.com
I was scrollin' through hoes, lookin' for a bitch to fuck
I'm like, ""That babe, uh huh.""
I was just about to call her
Then I saw an ad pop up, I'm like, ""Wait, oh my God!""
You see, I had a really long day
And I just could not turn down an Asian massage
So, I called 'em up and I said
""Hello, when is your next slot available?""
She said, ""You can come right now.""
Fuck yeah! ""Hurry up, because I'll wait for you!""
I pulled up and I sat in the waiting room
'Cause this shit all are set up, it's debatable
If I get confronted by the police
I just want a massage, I am not here to break the rules
Then an Asian lady had a pen and told me
""Come over here to the counter!""
Then she ask me if I wanted to get a session
For 30 minutes or an hour
I said, ""Hmm uh, I'll take 30
Nah, matter of fact I'll do an hour, fuck it.""
'Cause I know whatever's 'bout to go on
Behind those doors I'm 'bout to love it
She say, ""Usually 50 dollar but for you I do 45.""
I say thank you and gave her the money
Then she say, ""Okay, let's go inside!""
I'm like, ""Fuck yeah!"" - it's about to go down right now
So good what I found right now
I'm about to let it all out right now, yeah

She said, ""Take your clothes off, and then put this robe on!""
I'm like, ""Okay, no prob'.""
Oh God, this about to be so fun
And no one even knows; she left, I got undressed
And all the sudden a new Asian girl walked through the door
She said, ""Hello, how are you?
I am Muli, that's what you can call me
And I give you lovely Asian massage.""
I've been waitin' for this all day
I position myself on the table
And put my face down in the circular cushion
And she started massagin' my back
I knew somethin' was up with the way she was lookin'
Then she slid her tiny little finger tips
Down my spine right over my buttcrack
She was massagin' my booty
Then go to my thighs and start touchin' my nutsack
Fuck yeah!
Then I put a little bitty sway in my hips to let her know I like it
Somethin' was 'bout to go down
You can see it a mile away, you don't have to be psychic
She said, ""You want someting?""
I said, ""Yes I do.""
She said, ""You big strong man, I really like you!""
I said, ""I like you too.""
Then she said, ""You want the hand, sucky, fucky?
Tell me right now 'cause I need to know!""
I said ""I'll have all three of those""
Then I thought ooh she a little freaky ho
She said, ""I give it to you for cheap, you give me 125 dollar""
I said, ""Okay, here you go!""
Lowkey I was feelin' kinda awkward
She jacked me off and gave me my top first
I stayed quiet as I watched her
My dick had a strong posture
She said, ""You very big like a monster!""
She got naked then I humped her
I'm lovin' this little tiny Asian booty, I swear that this girl is the best
I'm buildin' a sweat, I'm killin' it yes
I pulled out and spilled on her breast
Everything was just right
I hit the hour on the deadline
I guess I'm gonna leave now
She said, ""That's fine, thank you, come again next time!""

I can be your everything, you give me fifty bucks
If you no say nothing, I can give you sucky-sucky
If you give me more money, I give you do something lucky
Hey, no shame in my game, buddy
If you lookin' for me, you know where to find me
At an Asian massage parlor
Because when the times get rough, a happy ending is necessary
Hahaha
Oh yeah - strap up, kids! It's important"
21,Heather Nicole,2010,RAW (2010),,Hopsin,"At night in my window I see a silhouette
Crying heavy tears look how wet my pillow gets
Throughout my days I don't smile I just get upset
And since you left look at all the shit that it affects
I take a picture of your face and I just hold it up
Kiss it, then reminisce on when it was both of us
It's hard for me to open up, I'm always talking to myself
But to nobody else
Some say that church or maybe counseling could probably help
But they don't know about all of my idiotic lies
All the fucking times I left you traumatized
Swore up and down to you saying I'm a try
And never did, I try not to cry but I feel bad I didn't apologize
It's time I cough it up and tell more, my soul is taken never sell yours
I did some shit I probably coulda been in jail for
Bury me deep inside hells core
And don't let me out until you hear bells roar
She said, you never loved me
You just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh how I wish that could tell you
You're gone, you're dead, you'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head, I wish that I could tell you
You're gone, you're dead, you'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head, I wish that I could tell you
It's hard to forget, my heart is a brick
I tell myself Marcus, I thought that you were smarter than this
The mess I put you through was worse than pearl harbor and shit
I'd always harm you and flip, mentally scar you and trip
Sometimes I'd argue and get, the nerve to call you a bitch
Then bruise your back against the dresser that I tossed you against
My Juliet at the time I never thought you was it
I do now but shit you're gone, so I just offer you this
A song to you, through it I open the crack in my chest
And show the whole world I've always had a lack of respect
For women who went to my life, I look to vengeance as knife
Intentions to fight, if you thinking I was senseless you right
Now every sentence I write, I think twice on it so I don't regret
'Cause only stress lies in a simple mind of loneliness
I'm an unholy mess, put me in a hole to rest
Welcome to my life this is how painful my stories get
She said, you never loved me
You just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh how I wish that could tell you
You're gone, you're dead, you'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head, I wish that I could tell you
You're gone, you're dead, you'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head, I wish that I could tell you
Now use this track as a lesson
All you guys out there who have some aggression
Towards your woman it don't have to get hectic
That crap is pathetic, now look at me I have to regret it
I can't go near her or nothing, she'll probably have me arrested
The only thing I could do is just make a track with a message
And hope she hears it so she could know I was badly infected
I never meant to be that type of guy
But I realized that I was, and because of it I'm throwing my sinister life aside
I can cry at any moment just thinking about it
Sometimes I hide it from the folks that I'm hanging around with
I should apply for a new soul 'cause I think it's invalid
Somebody told me when I die I'll be safe but I doubt it
The grudge she holds against me, it hurts me so severely
She won't come near me, I thought that time was supposed to cure me
I'm so alone and weary, writing songs to heal me
I swear that I'm sorry Heather, I mean it so sincerely
She said, you never loved me
You just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh how I wish that could tell you
You're gone, you're dead, you'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head, I wish that I could tell you
You're gone, you're dead, you'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head, I wish that I could tell you"
22,Hip Hop Sinister,2013,Knock Madness (2013),,Hopsin,"I'm changing man
I thought I was supposed to be this hip hop savior
But I have turned into a sinister
Yeah
Wack niggas prepare to die
You ain't got nowhere to hide
I'm knocking at your fucking door
You scared 'cause you know arrived
Niggas gonna get dealt with rhymes
It's just me, myself and I
I low-key run this rap shit
You don't know 'cause it ain't televised
This is war, gentleman (kill)
My flow is filled with more venom
Than George Zimmerman in his car chillin'
With a loaded 44 tucked into his drawers
Fitchiting, Itching to find a brand new casket to store niggas in
Y'all just make me laugh and giggle
Call me out on tracks then bitch I'll pound on you
Like that vending machine that stole my pack of Skittles
Niggas thought the old me, dissolved, and I went soft
After my album raw
But naw bitch I evolved
I'm taking over shit easily
I rarely do collaborations 'cause y'all ain't qualified to be in a league with me
Hop just let the beast unleashed
Someone get this freak a leash
I'm snapping on all of you leaving every MC deceased
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
Motherfucker we making history
A million independently
So kiss my fucking ass
Left or right you get to pick the cheek
You don't ball you just pretend to do to make the chicks believe
Your label is fucking you like Ruthless Records did to me
Stop with the compliments
I've been locked in my momma's den
Plotting when I will be dropping this Hopsin apocalypse
Bombing the competent
Rap goblins mobbing the continent
Gotta be dominant
I'm surprised that God isn't vomiting
I'm wearing a badge tearing your ass
Another vast cutting through necks till they barely attached
Me and this game are one of the same like Jaren and crack
The darkness is arrived so make a flare with a match
You got skill?
Where is it at?
I haven't seen it
Who dares to attack a genius?
You get managed I'll have you gag your penis
Until you throw up your own liver (nuts)
I don't give a (fuck)
The flow ripper (what)
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
Now if I stop being who I am that would upset me
I'll never change for none of your wack ass deadbeats
I struggled to change for Jay Christ to accept me
I don't even change clothes
Shit not even my bed sheets
When I step inside the boot and rhyme
Rappers commit suicide
And jump in front of a moving semi-truck like it was cool to die
Niggas is watered down fuck it
It is time to scuba dive
Better get on your knees and pray to God and hope that you survive
Killing rappers like I condone violence
I murder you and when your soul is floating to hell I ghost ride it
You won't last living in this cold climate
So don't try it
I know I'm ill
I don't need no pussies to co-sign it
Commercial niggas thinking they carry the torch
It's going to be very hilarious when I bury your corpse
So next time you spit a fucking rhyme that's too simple
I'll joke kick your ass through the glass of the booth window
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder"

They can get it (They can get it)
You can get it (You can get it)
Y'all can get it (It really doesn't matter nigga)
The Dark Knight's in this bitch without the mask and cape
I'm acting ape shit, faggot, embrace it
I just got validation on my ass whooping ticket
I'm that amazing, it's my mad invasion
Of smashing brains in, my fucking pen and pad was anxious
All these haters who mad and be nagging at me
I flip their ass off like an acrobat on a trapeze
And I'll be lashing back like a Shaq attack on these rap beats
You thought that I was done with completely being an ass? Please
Don't think you raw just 'cause you got success
I'll uppercut your ass so many times you look like you was nodding yes
I'm the only child that my mom regrets, probably best
That you don't buy my album, save your money yo do not invest
Your bullshit come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!

I consider my flow a malignant rifle, and strip survival
And have you screaming like RnB singers who hittin' high notes
It's sick and spiteful, 2Pac's twisted grim disciple
I been this nice yo way before Michael had vitiligo
My ex girl heart is so bruised and burned
Begging me to quit rap, but I'm just not ready to let it loose for her
Am I Hopsin or am I Lucifer?
I didn't blow till I started talking a gang of shit, tell me who you prefer
Nigga, you ain't ill in the booth
I'd die and do my next show as a hologram and still be realer than you
I'm the shit like I slithered in poo
I'm sicker than sticking my freaking dick inside of a bitch's syphilis cooch
It's knock madness

I gotta problem yo'
I was ecstatic to buy Yeezus
But I burned it first
Heard it and snapped in 5 pieces
Man Kanye on that bullshit!
That's why the paparazzi made that nigga hit his fucking head that's what that fool get
You think you god now you half assin rap little faggot bitch
Perhaps you suffered brain damage back when you had that accident?
But most importantly, hip hop isn't dead no more you see
'Cause Kendrick took the bar and raised it up higher for MCs
Unfortunately the little nigga's like 4 ft 3, the guys a fuckin' midget
His high is still really short to me
Fuck it when my pencil breaks
My mental state tells me to renovate
If you hand me your shit I toss your demo tape
""Hop if your not spreading love then why do you even write music?""
'Cause this is how I feel when I ain't rappin' on the mic you bitch
Am I supposed to coat it up? Am I not allowed to open up?
I spill the blood of rappers and use Weezy dreads to soak it up
Busting like south central drive byes
Support the guy with white eyes
But nigga don't ride my dick when I'm on that high rise
Your bullshit come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!
I got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin' on it

Baby, Hopsin is in the building! (I'm RAW) We gone have one hell of a time
Right now!
Who am I? A snobby and deadly poet
So nigga put down the pen 'cause I probably already wrote it
I'm the nigga that Hollywood barely noticed for pullin' cards
It's easy as sockin' on Gary Coleman
How did you get a deal without having no type of talent
The shit you write is invalid, you gettin' your mic impounded
I'm livin' in a dump, you livin' life in a palace
Dining with caesers salad, man how do you guys allow it
Yo, you weak niggas in the limelight trippin'
But I won't let you slide like friction
Not tryna be ya buddy in this rap shit, I like dissing
So you can kiss my ass and watch the white eyes glisten
Y'all niggas be regulating the area, hesitating to scare to some defimation of character nigga
I got it locked no separating the barriers, medicate your hysteria, heaven's waiting to carry ya
My hot 16's be on that I'll shit! (uh huh)
Your hot 16's deal with the children (uh huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building! (you know) We gone have one hell of a time
Right now!
I'm a pro but I kick it with the beginners with what I whip up for dinner
It's been up on my agenda
I came and left but now I'm finna re-enter shiver-me-timbers
How the fuck can a nigga be realer
I don't know-but my flow, is so cold, mistah oh no
I show dough nigga, I'm ready fo' war
When you was flossin' on me tryna swerve in your hummer
I was plottin' way bigger nigga, word to your mother
My verses are butter, I emerge from the gutter
To step up inside the booth and then work motherfuckers
I'm hungry as all of the roaches that lurk in my cupboard
You should be duckin' and running, send the word to the others
I'm a fuckin' nightmare in your worst hell, and I'm leavin' niggas stuck behind the bars
They don't deserve bail
You see wackness doesn't sit on my nerves well
You couldn't bust with a dick full of sperm cells
My hot 16's be on that I'll shit! (uh uh)
Your hot 16's deal with the children (uh huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building! (you know) We gone have one hell of a time

You see I'm lyrically bashing up on your feelings
I'm bad and I don't conceal it, the dragon is known for killing
That's the reason I'm bagging these hoes and grillin' niggas
My madness is so appealing and swagger is on a billion
Aside from all the provocative hell-ishness
I'm somewhat underground but got the commercial elements
According to ruthless records it wasn't evident, so I'm a 9/11 nigga and label bitches to hell with it niggas
I'm that crazy nigga, you can't be iller
I'll pick ya fuckin' mom up in a 18-wheeler
Yeah I'll hit it, but if she don't wanna pay me scrilla
I'll let a rottweiler fuck her till the raibes kill her
My hobbies are rapping vicious, slapping bitches, grabbing digits, and I occasionally laugh at midgets
I'm hardly sane and niggas with a dab of mischeif
Never rap no shit if I haven't lived it it's not specific

25,Hotel in Sydney,2017,No Shame (2017),,Hopsin,"Are you guys letting me go now?
Yeah, yeah I'm afraid not ya fucking dog of a cunt.
Let's go, Dickhead
Officer, you said I was only gonna be here for 30 minutes,
It's been 5 hours man what's goi-
Yeaaaaaaaa, shut your fuckin' mouth ya fuckwit before I fuckin' bash ya
Man, what the fuck are yo talking
Go inside ya fuckin' wombat
Man this is stupid
Go on sit down
Oh, god
Now, your misses claims you assaulted her
Psssssst
Bloody oath man, why'd ya fuckin' beat her?
Man, I didn't fucking beat her, listen, I'm telling you
I got her the engagement ring that she liked
Booked a new flight to come to Sydney, just to see her
Start a new life
Man she's 20 weeks pregnant, and I was tryin' do right
For us, the family, the kid. But maybe I was too nice
My homie text me a picture, and I just burst into anger
It was my girl - in a bed, with her personal trainer
I text my homie like ""Yo, where you find this?""
He says ""Snapchat bro. It's all on my timeline, shit.""
Swear it struck a fuckin' nerve in my chest
I looked at my girl and said ""Get a paternity test!""
She said ""NO! Don't you get all worked and upset
I only slept in the bed right after work just to rest.""
I said ""What? You expect me to believe that?
Ha, alright, yeah, I'll 'relax' guess it doesn't seem bad,
My girlfriend's with a buff nigga gettin' t-bagged.""
Officer, correct me if I'm wrong but she needed her head detached!
I said ""bitch, I can't believe this shit
Does he know your pregnant? Is that his kid?
Look how big my headache is
This whole time y'all havin' sex and shit
What type of nigga would fuck a pregnant chick?
I said, ""Let's get this paternity test, I'm not kidding bitch.""
She said, ""No - I'm not getting it!""
Officer, I ain't seen her in months
I couldn't trust the lying whore
Plus she told me she slept with this guy before
And then I said, y'know what? Forget it. S'all good
Nevermind, shit was making my blood pressure high
I love her unconditionally, you know?
I can't pretend I ain't never lie
For the moment, I guess I'll let it slide
She said ""If you don't want to take care of this kid, Marcus then say so""
I said ""Wait, no, it's mine too, I can't go, how you gonna support this kid without me? You don't make dough.""
She said ""Hahaha. I make loads.""
She had six grand cash
I said ""But you was broke two weeks ago!
How you makin' chips that fast?""
She said, ""I bartend, I made it all in tips haha.""
I said, ""Girl, you must take me as a big jackass.""
I'm like ""Please, we both know money is hard to come by""
Her bullshit, might fly over the heads of some guys
Officer, she's always telling dumb lies
I've known her for six years, and she hasn't lifted a finger one time!
I said, ""Where'd you get the cash from?""
She said ""I bartend, duh, from tips. I'm a waitress""
I said, ""Where'd you get the cash from?""
She started stuttering like ""uhm-uh-mmm Marcus, wait just-""
I said, ""Where'd you get the cash from?""
She said, ""Ok, ok, I'll tell you just promise me you won't get mad.""
I'm like ""Baby, where'd you get the cash from?""
She said ""I work at a strip club... It's how I made the six grand.""
I said ""Whoa, no... NO!""
I fell down in tears, my heart broke, I turned cold
I don't want the girl that I'm in love with doin' hoe shit
If she needed cash, I woulda loaned it, and she knows it
They won't lemme get a refund on this $20,000 ring
Fuck my head hurts, I need some ibuprofen
Yeah, Mr. Hopsin, you need a minute?
Um, may I have some water please?
Ah, no worries at all
I don't mean to cry and get emotional, but all this just bothers me
Yeah, it's alright, you're good... Yeah, here ya go mate
Thanks... *sips water*
I wasn't me no more, I looked her in the eyes, and straight told her
What'd you say to her?
I need you to tell me where this strip club is at
Or this family we're about to have is over
I said ""Tell me where it's at?""
She said ""No.""
I said ""You about to make me mad...""
She said ""So?""
I said ""Bitch, you better panic and run. The damage is done.
You doin' this 4 months away from having my son. UGH.""
I told her I would always have her back
I forgave her after all the careless acts
I have one question, and she couldn't share the facts
The strip club - How come she couldn't tell me where it's at?
Who the fuck she fuckin' in there?
Who's dick she suckin' in there?
Shakin' her fuckin' butt in the air
It's like we've argued for a thousand fucking hours
I'm annoyed and I was at the point where something was about to get destroyed
I grabbed her purse, threw that shit across the room
I fuckin' launched it too
It was filled with makeup kits and all of her jewels
I blacked out
She said ""What the fuck is wrong with you?""
She got up out the bed to get it - I pushed her ass back in it
I said ""We still talkin' bitch. You and I ain't finished. Nah. This strip club, where is it? BITCH WHERE THE FUCK IS IT?""
I said ""You know what? Fuck it. Awesome. Fine.""
In the process of all this drama, I had lost my mind
I felt lost and blind
The gym trainer, the strip club
The ring, the baby
She really crossed the line
And then I finally came down and all the madness was finished
Then she invited me to dinner with her family in Penrith
I said ""I ain't goin' with you, you can leave now,
I need to stay in this hotel room, and figure some things out.""
Officer, I know you ain't gonna sympathize
I don't approve of any man putting hands on his girlfriend or wife
Especially when she's pregnant with his kid inside
Honestly, feel like I wasn't in the wrong
But still, I wasn't in the right
Ask her she ain't got no bruises on her
I'm human - there's only so much a dude can conquer
She knew that her actions reflected true dishonor and tried to cover it
Sayin' I'm and abusive monster that's bullshit, huh
And that fast, poof, all of her wrongs are in the past cool
She's just the innocent white girl and I'm the black guy
Who always gets mad, true!
I know y'all about to make it hard for me to get back into Australia
Man this fucking shit is sad
Dude, I still don't know if this baby is mine or not
So when he's born, who's gonna be the fuckin' dad?
You?"

You niggas will now where the heck I'm from
I'm keeping it raw fo' sho', flow's so diabolical
You watching 'em, but it took like 10 whole years
Just for my balls to grow
No overnight success, I'm struggling just to write this mess
The road to rightousness was more than words and skill that I possess

If you think I have a big head, then you haven't see my brother!
Stacked bad niggas swore I wouldn't make a rap
Promised it couldn't happen and hated with a passion
A mixtape later I silenced their laughing
Now the same ones would probably suck my dick if I asked 'em
Its obvious I have it locked like CAPS
Rocking to a bitch fight beat that slaps
I do it major, Poly Sci and Bio
I don't have haters only fans in denial
Now gimme a minute to hop in my zone, I'm making 'em pop like Mary
I'm rocking the party to act all retarded, I'm making 'em pop like cherries
I know this nigga is wild, but I will knock him down
Just answer this question for me:
How you like me, how you like me now?

Like I'm toaster bread
I say shit that don't get said
That's why I can't roll with feds
Illuminati got they eye on me
And they gonna see to it that a nigga don't get fed
My purpose ain't hard to see
I pull up on rappers like ""pardon me
Your bars are weak, you spend too much time
Tryina get your sparkling charm to bling""
I be kickin them multiple syllables
Ripping up shows and holding my genitals
Get a dose of the wicked flow before your niggas run up
Sayinh ""Homie, you should've known""
It's crazy how life can switch
I ain't gonna lie to you mine was shit
Not anymore, shit changed up
From woman selection to size of tits
I know bitches who can ride the dick
Niggas who think that my eyes are sick
Showing them many agents who be loving
The melodies that I supply them with
I gotta a note for all y'all
In the rap game who got an album stacking dough
Y'all got big, chains'll start falling off like Michael Jackson's nose
Who the illest? Y'all know

It's all good though
You don't know shit about shit
If you only knew what I do, if you only knew what I could do
If you could only see what I could see you would probably stop bothering me
I independently started this shit
Marketing hits, starving for chips
No gasoline to start off the whip
Felt like the only nigga labels wasn't bargaining with
My heart has been ripped, I stuck with it as hard as it gets
These producers would always blow me off
Now that I'm blowing up, they don't recall
Talking about ""Yo, you my homie, dawg""
Oh, now you wanna hop on the Hop train
Knowing damn well since '04 I had hot flames
My real buddies was mainly the worst
Hatin' to shoot my videos without me paying them first
So I slide 'em 100 bucks to watch 'em bitch on how it ain't enough
That money got my cell, internet and cable cut!
A real homie would've gave a fuck
And not expect to pay upfront
Then get the money later when I'm making some
Nobody saw the bigger picture except me
They neglect me
Only thing that protects me is FV
You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Bitch I am raw

An enthusiastic freshman, major in Economics
I didn't have a clue what to expect to be honest
Banging beats in my dorm, streaming Pornhub constant
I figured I could make it out in 4 years tops
Study religiously and graduate, apply for a job
The rap thing was secondary, I was putting it off
Calling it quits, assuming ""I have better chances playing golf""
My third year came and suddenly that changed
I couldn't bear watching my mom at home suffering pain
Tryna fight off the strain of only having half a stomach
Plus a handicap back from a surgery that helped nothing!
So I returned to the valley and called the homie
Hop was on Ruthless getting shelved like a trophy
I told him how I left my life in the OC
And we concluded we could both use FV
You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Bitch I am raw
This was written for niggas who wouldn't give me dap
Niggas who told me that I had sissy rap
This was written for all the bitches I used to called who never hit me back
Until they heard the word I was buzzin', c'mon don't give me that
You backed out, now you tryna roll with my click?
Where the fuck were you when my signing bonus was spent?
Where the fuck were you when I got the notice for rent
Saying I was getting evicted and I was hopeless as shit?
See I keep some names handy and you got thrown on the list
That's how you know that I'm pissed
I got you, don't even trip
'Cause I'm rude over the nicest beats
You had to go ignite the heat
You might agree to beef, but yo I'm not the type you'd like to meet
Life's indeed a journey that I have yet to finish
Hopefully my career's something that will be epidemic
You'll always know it's Hopsin the way I wreck a sentence
Realness, I represent it
Raw, I'm the definition
You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Bitch I am raw"
28,I Can't Decide,2010,RAW (2010),,Hopsin,"In the land of the killing
Better say your prayers tonight
Amen, it's hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
'Cause these niggas wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?
I can't decide
Now see, Tyrone does whatever his homies do
Just the dope hes doin'
Deep in his mind he knows he's cool
He's ditchin' class 'cause he feels like he don't belong in school
Momma always yellin' out, Damn Tyrone, what's wrong with you!
He wanna show the world he grew in some balls
Abusin' the law, 8 weeks in juvenile hall
This dude is the cause of a lot of shit
Don't know where is father went
Never had no confidence, resortin' to poppin' clips
His homies thought that they were violent assassins
They said, come on tyrone, it's time to get active
We gon' roll up on this nigga
Real silent and passive
Then you pull out the 9 and then blast him
We gon' roll to his crib
Be careful shootin' so you don't hit the kids
You down fo' it?
Tyrone said, ""You know what it is""
So they roll up, about to retaliate on this busta
""Pop pop"" (Bitch ass muthafucka)
In the land of the killing
Better say your prayers tonight
Amen, it's hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
'Cause these niggas wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?
I can't decide
Tyrones big ballin'
Gettin' the dough
Fuck bitches and hoes
Still rippin the 4's
Walk with his fist clinched he was itching to blow
Shit, and all the local neighborhood niggas would know
It's like he was born to fit the streets
Never had no chicken feet
Walked up to the local liquor store to get a swisher sweet
Before he walked in some dudes was like
""Aye Nigga... pop pop pop, we don't play nigga""
They just shot him when his lives undone
The man inside the liquor store dialed 911
And at the same time he's strugglin' tryin' to find someone
Screamin ""Help, help, stay alive, young son!""
The boys gunna die and he knows that
A bullet went through his skull cap
He's barely breathing
And both of his eyes balls have rolled back
Oh crap the people who witnessed it can't believe it yo
Maybe it's linked to the drive by he did a week ago
In the land of the killing
Better say your prayers tonight
Amen, it's hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
'Cause these niggas wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?
I can't decide
Tyrone's dead, all over some dumb shit
His homies don't know who did it
They just got assumptions
Ready to whall out
With a sinister function
And drive by on some bitch niggas and dump clips
And OG was like ""fuck it he's dead now
So open up the 40 and take a sip and pour the rest out
Y'all got me stressed now
Shit y'all need to chill out
'Cause every time some shit be poppin' off y'all pull the steel out""
One of the younger homies was like
""Fuck that, we gon' tug gats and bust back, trust that""
The O.G. was like
""Man Y'all don't need to be out here bustin' slugs
Y'all don't even know who the fuck it was
Y'all fucking bugs
Y'all gunna be dead taking this violent route
You little niggas always whilin out
You need to getcha shit straight and understand whatcha life about
'Cause if a bullet hit your ass believe your lights is out.""
The younger homie like ""Nigga, you don't run these streets
You ain't never been no fucking G
If I wanna bust my heat it's up to me
And I know them niggas that killed T
Are the same niggas that we hit up the other week""
Another homie like ""Naaah they ain't get back for that
'Cause that's them niggas pulling up in the Cadilla-pop pop pop pop
In the land of the killing
Better say your prayers tonight
Amen, it's hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
'Cause these niggas wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?
I can't decide"

Fuckin' with me then it can get (ugly)
Stuffin' your corpse in a mattress (lovely)
Then I'll invite your girlfriend over for a sleepover on that nigga that's (disgusting)
She can gag this (dumpling)
Ho do not stop till my shaft's (erupting)
You shoulda known what the fuck I was tryna do, I did not call your ass over for nothing
How do I feel? Here's a riddle son
Cut all my fingers off except the middle ones (what?)
Now bend your ass over and sit on one (what?)
A.K.A. I've lost it, nigga run
Whole world gettin' so sick of em, my nuts swing like a pendulum
I'm on Instagram right now postin' pics of 'em
They are so cute together, aren't they, look at them (awwh)
One's bigger than the other though, just thought I'd let you mutha'fuckas know
I'm posted in a bungalow, gettin' deep throat from a juggalo
Please do not get your face paint on my stomach ho
Where the real MCs? There are no more
Swag ship took sail and they all on board
Holla at me when you wanna learn the art of war
I carnivore, flexin' hard like I'm Arnold Schwarz
I'm explicit business, witness sickness spit from the lips of mischief
Talk shit, get hit, I can split your wig with a knife into your dome with my fist to clinch it (that's murder homie)
Oh shit, oh my, hit a nigga like I'm Kimbo Slice
And spend your life, so bitch don't try
I throw you out a fuckin' window, bye, and film it on vine, and get more likes (well, oh right)
Soon as that cyclone hits, you know I'm back on that psycho shit
I got psychosis, my brains filled with deadly microchips
I'm plottin' your death with crayons and hieroglyphs (you crazy, nigga)
Huh, I know this, in the club too turnt tryna fight your bitch
Swing at me nigga I won't flinch, can't you see my fuckin' minds on Grinch, I love violence

Put a nigga in that stove (like roast)
I know, you phoned, 5-0, I'm ghost
Straight through the exit, fuck a ho and use the same condom on the next bitch
Nasty ass nigga having sex with a dead chick
Film it with the GoPro, slow-mo, and upload it to Netflix
Uhmm, excuse me I hate to bother
Do you know where I can find a little Asian parlor?
Where they'll play with my balls like a game of soccer
And fuck me too for like eighty dollars?
I need my dick scrubbed and bathed in water
I hold the bitch down to play some doctor
If I ask her for it, it's gon' make it awkward
If I tip her well she'll give brains and swallow
I'm a nutcase with ADD
Who rapes these beats, don't try cause you can't be me
Y'all can't be pleased, stop hatin' on my angry steez
It makes me cheese, I barely know my ABC's
But still I'm on and I made like 2 million bucks
Oh, look at y'all niggas now, you give a fuck
Shit, askin' to be on my team tryna take my God damn cream cause you niggas stuck
Same niggas always name droppin' like
""Aye Hopsin, I rap too, I'm tryna get paid off it
Dre heard my shit and said it was great
I'll probably get signed to Eminem any day
And next week, Snoop Dogg, he gon' get me blazed
One time I opened up a concert for MGK
My big partner, lil cousin, man, he friends with Drake
And Big Boy up at Power said he'll get me play
I had a video on Worldstar, dawg believe it
I don't know what happened but it got deleted""
(Man if you don't get your ass out of my God damn face talkin' that bullshit nigga)
Stop it with the lies dude, I'ma just remind you
I hate phony niggas, I will not pretend to like you
Thirsty ass niggas love talkin' when I slide through
Fuck you, nigga you ain't hoppin' into my crew
Damn, shit
Fuck nigga

30,I Must Be on Somethin,2017,No Shame (2017),,Hopsin,"He must be on something
Lately I been acting kinda cuckoo
Momma said I gotta a screw or two loose
I must be on something
The doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood
I ain't just been feeling like I used to
I must be on something
I been lost and ain't nobody found me
To be honest it ain't safe to be around me
I must be on something
This shit isn't normal
Maybe it's my hormones
Fuck it, Lord knows
I must be on something
Shit lately my logic has been so irrational
Violence is laughable
What's the antidote? I don't have control
I need a chaperone when I'm back at home and a padded zone
'Cause I've been known to speak in a savage tone and slap a hoe
Do I even have a soul?
My thoughts are so unimaginable
My brain just hasn't grown since I climbed through my momma's vaginal
And I been asked to go to a shrink
It ain't gon' happen bro
Suck a dick and swallow a massive load
Bitch, I can explode at any moment
Don't get me going 'cause a lot can happen
You talking crap and wake up in a fucking saw contraption
Raw assassin you see me you better be hallin ass, then
Your gashes can't be treated with Tylenol or aspirin
No cotton swab or napkin can clean the mess up
It's me and my alter ego against the world its just us
Ain't no one who texting my cellular phone except sluts
Its clear there's a problem with me so guess what?
He must be on something
Lately I been acting kinda cuckoo
Momma said I gotta a screw or two loose

I must be on something
This shit isn't normal
Maybe it's my hormones
Fuck it, Lord knows
I must be on something
The world has fucked me it's time to get even now
They say I'm the one no one want to be around
Guess it's my deceiving smile
Guess it's because I be treating people foul
Making songs about them, talking shit and then freaking out
This is how I handle all solutions
There's no false illusion
Fuck an evil witch bitch I'm the demon that's off the broom stick
Where's the fire I'm walking through it
Y'all ain't got the balls to do it
I'm talking stupid it's all inclusive with my psychotic state
Filled with a lot of hate I'mma operate on my enemies
Chop 'em up and then drop 'em on pots and plates
I'm not to fuck with so stop it let's not debate
Usually never talking much 'cause I'm stuck in a awkward state
The pain I have everlasting
Won't be surprised when I'm lifting ashes from my hellish habits the hell is happening
The condition I'm in is probably worst then you can imagine
Make sure you say this shit to who ever's asking
He must be on something
Lately I been acting kinda cuckoo
Momma said I gotta a screw or two loose
I must be on something
The doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood

I just, I just don't, I just, I just, I just don't know
I - I - I just, I just don't, I just, I just don't know what to do
I'm back nigga, what's up?
Hop, how'd you get your buzz up?
I heard you signed over your soul to the devil
Was it true? Nigga shut the fuck up!
In my heart there ain't much love
So if you get bashed then that's tough luck
FV doin' shit so big, haters I'm on your side now, nigga fuck us!
It's Knock Madness!
Yeah, I'm back up in this
I'm a real nice nigga but I rap for vengeance
Only got bad intentions and I'm looking for a new mouth
That my nutsack could fit in
I look like an idiot to grab attention
But my new fans tellin' me to trash my lenses
It's bad for business, I'm lacking senses
It feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension
Stepped in this biz to wreck
So don't disrespect, I promise that'll be a big regret
I'll twist ya' neck, I'm lookin' for a fish to catch
I chop niggas up, yeah I learned it from Tech
I got hoes all over that wanna give me (dome)
They all yellin' Hopsin you turn me (on)
But I feel like it's the devil tryna' get me (whoa)
And I don't wanna do it nigga, send me (home)
Nigga, I'm so cool, but I feel so low
See I got a crew, but I feel solo
I cruise, but the wheels don't roll
You feel what I'm sayin'? Shit neither do I
I'ma give you niggas one more album and after that
It's peace out and I'm leaving you guys, you know why?
The world made feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
No no no no no no no no no no
Hopsin is doomed, locked in a room
Spaced out like I love poppin' the shrooms
God lit a fuse
Now I gotta make a decision and I don't really know which Hopsin to choose
I'm a big wreck, did you not get the news?
I made a million bucks but did not get abused
How did I manage to get robbed from the truth
Maybe I shoulda never went and dropped outta school
It's not that bad, you're okay kid, cheer up
But I got a life that I ain't too sure of
So I gotta dress like Ace Ventura
Can't look at myself I might break this mirror
(Shit! Fuck! Fuck!) I'm paranoid
I panic over every little scary noise
See, when I go pick up the phone and tell friends about it
They won't answer 'cause they're annoyed
I'm like uggghh, I put a porno on 'cause my life ain't awesome, man
Jack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again
Then repeat the cycle
Can't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on
You don't know how many fuckin' demons I know
Maybe I should go try to read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)
I don't even like rap, only thing I wanted was just to be cool
And hang out with a group of friends and solve mysteries like I'm Scooby Doo
But I got way more than I bargained for
You can't chill when your heart is sore
I'm so mad I could start a war
So fuck Hopsin, man, I don't really know who I are no more
The world made feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Man, y'all niggas tryna' kill my vibe
Lately, don't nobody feel my rhymes
Dizzy's blowin' up tryna steal my shine
I'm all outta ammo, my skills just died
But like, ""Oh my God, I love Ill Mind 5!""
The one where the dumb skippity bums get high
That there changed my whole entire life
You make more things like that, I'll buy
Well I got news for you, my screws are loose (I'll tell ya)
This rap thing here's what I used to do, now I'm movin' to (Australia)
When I go ghost I'ma get a house on the Gold Coast yelling YOLO
On a couch, feelin' so dope, livin' low-pro, so these foul niggas don't know, I'll be strutting around like (Hell yeah!)
Man, I'm losin' my mind
Y'all assume that I'm cool when I rhyme
See I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin
But I get depressed when the two intertwine
Truthfully
I'm not the man that I used to be
Nobody cared so I used the beat
To talk to, so I lose some heat
I'm cut bad and the bruise is deep
Is there anything you can do for me?
The world made feel like I lost myself
My own homies tellin' me that I need help
If you got a solution for me you should probably
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know
Holla at cha boy if you know somebody

Homie I don't need a major label
I'm at home with twitter fingers whippin' up my own promotions
Rap monster, Black Mamba
You can't run from the wrath I've been asked to cast on you
To all the haters who been keepin' up with my every move
Here's my penis to latch on you
I'm the only MC in this wack genre (bitch)
Don't look at me, I'ma spaz on you
Kids, go get the key to your dad's Honda and turn up
Roll up the street and you pass ganja (are you serious?)
I came up with a couple new answers (what's that?)
I'ma need a couple new dancers (nigga what?)
'Cause I done made a whole lot of money
But I'm feelin' blue still, I ain't talking zoolander
I was Hugh Heff'in on the low
When my girl found out, she was like ""You Bastard
It's so obvious you never even loved me
You stupid ugly motherfucker, fuck you and her""
Fangs a web and I'm caught between it
Walk and breathe it cool thing and It's all convenient
Hoes begging me to sign all across the cleavage
Nigga, you should hear the tone that they talk to me with
I'd be stupid if I don't fill 'em all with semen (true)
I don't know where to go with these darker demons (true)

Got MC's hemmed up, choking on rope
Haters keep talking, but doing nothing about it
As I let my nuts hang while I'm holding on both
I been on one, charged up like protons
I'm so gone, It's going down like those runs nigga
Been collecting more funds like bank robbers who tote guns
It's so fun, look at the hoes come nigga
Step aside, allow me to prepare for my finale
It's grind time around me (yup)
Damn, Hopsin you tight no doubt B
Back at it again with the white Janoskis
Look, I ain't innocent I stay killing shit
Rape sentences shake witnesses, I'm on the same minutes
Vacate the damn premises, my brain's missing
I date women for 8 minutes then play them like Sega Genesis
Straight nigga, but shit it's too late to take Ritalin
Doctors, they've been itchin' for days to make sense of it
If I'm around, no such thing as a safe citizen
When I'm on the mic I deliver like St. Nicholas
Niggas get in shivers the moment the base trickling
You can see I'm not in the mood to play, gentlemen
Forever ill is something you can't fiddle with
You ain't got the balls to hang, okay little dick?
Niggas, I'm god, I'm a numskull

34,I'm Not Crazy,2010,RAW (2010),,Hopsin,"Hello Hopsin... Word on the streets is that you're crazy... And I honestly believe you are
Listen, if I was really crazy I'd run up inside an orphanage
And torment kids, and beat babies faces with bags of oranges
Fake my origin and tell people that I was born to sin
I'd go back to filming molested porn again (Yeah)
I would murder a nigga then steal his body from whatever morgue it's in
And take it back to an alley to torture it
Study all of the Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, and Chuckie horror flicks
(Baby is that a knife that you have in your hand?) Of course it is!
I'd run around crazy like the Afghans do with some black camp boots wearin' a fuckin' Batman suit
And scream at bitches like I'm Fatman Scoop (C'mere!)
And tell them to take a deep breath 'cause this will be their last chance to
I'd hate on everyone who's sane and gifted (Yup)
Then claim that my brain is missing while sniffing cocaine
And then cut my dick for the Pain Olympics
If I was crazy I would go pick up the mic and use it
And tell Dwayne Carter that I really like his music (Shit)
But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!)
Crazy
(Ah!)
Crazy
If I was manic I probably woulda neglected my responsibilities and made society respect it
I'd walk around in a dress and a can of gas
And blow up a mothafucka for laughing with half a match
Dig up all the baby cadavers and grab a basket
And shoot them through every window of every crib that I'm passing
I'd probably be back a couple hours later to fuck 'em with every bottle
I cut up within my labor
Take a breather, make a haste of it and bounce
To the house that's adjacent and chase everyone out
And take 'em down
Tell them I'm the devil and I'm claiming everybody for a battle that's crazier than my brain is
Grab a chainsaw, blow the fuckin' dust back
Leave it all and still ready me a new blood bath
Run back to the psyche ward
Check my perimeter and get in before they knew that I left
But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!)
Crazy
(Ah!)
Crazy
Yo, I won't lie, I'm not as crazy as glue
But if I was let me describe all the bullshit I would do
I'd jack off with sandpaper while I'm watching The View
Picturing Whoopi bald headed stroking cock with her boobs!
I'll throw babies in dryers
Strangle tweakers that fidget
Contract HIV willfully, just to purposely give it
I'd mug mothers on welfare
Swim in gallons of gas
Meander to the batting cage and use my dick for a bat! (Shit!)
If I was deranged, I'd cop me a chain
Make it rain like Washington and throw a stripper some change
Make her work it on the floor, pussy pop on a handstand
Lick her dirty snatch and film it all on my webcam (Oh yeah!)
Honestly I'd be itching for gun-play
I'll cock the .45 and shoot up church on a Sunday
I'll hi-jack a plane while it's still on the runway
Fuck the stewardess and take the passengers' chump change!
But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!)
Crazy
(Ah!)

Every girl I meet, always talking bout ""I don't even wanna know Hopsin, ewe
Yeah, he got some skills but every time he put them eyes in it look like he popped some pills
I just wanna know Marcus, he's a sweet little innocent boy, oh God
I'd date him with no prob. And if he wanted to I'll let him beat the pussy with no condom.""
Bitch, what's your problem. You expect me to be optim
Mistic, With the mischief you bring you senseless bitch you out of
Your mind I know you like the fact I'm so bad when I spit up on the track
Black and I rap with a little bit of swag and happen to have a little money in the back
What the fuck do you got that'll impress me so I can feel half of the magic?
A loose vaginal passage, uh uh bitch put that back in the package
I feel so sick and lonely, I want a real girl that will get to know me
No charcoal breath who be hitting a stogy and not one that'll say shit to blow me
I'm a beam just like the shining sun

Don't be assuming that I'm going to love you 'cause if you do I'll cut you out of my life I promise you
I'm down to earth and I'm an honest dude. You barley be giving me any homage dues
I would infinitely regret it and probably get a headache if I was stupid and got with you
How many guys have you let bone you? (Uh?) Let me guess, you don't have no clue huh?
Could have been 5, could have been 10, could have been a million nigga's that hopped on you huh?

Yup I know how you work, you ain't nothing but a flirt baby girl that's one of the risks
Best believe that I'm a pass on that, ain't got time for no asshole acts
You say you a good girl that's no fact, can't roll smooth 'cause your axles cracked
You can't find a good man that's so sad, I think it's because you act so wack
So don't be trying to blame the world for your nonsense bitch I'll fuck around a smack yo ass

36,Ill Mind of Hopsin 7,2015,Pound Syndrome (2015),,Hopsin,"It's us, find power
Live life, mind power
It's us, find power
Life live, mind power
Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm
Life is a tour, I sit and ride along
Taking some notes and then I write the song
I'm staring down the road my life has gone
Is this where I belong
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong
My mental state is fucking me up and I cried a pond
While asking You for some answers, but we don't have that type of bond
That my desire's gone with the way that I've been living lately
If I died right now, you'd turn the fire on
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout
'Cause I hopped in Christianity so strongly then I fell out
Now I'm avoiding questions like a scared dog with his tail down
Feeling so damn humiliated because they looking at me like I'm hell bound
What story should I tell now, I'll just expose the truth
I'm so close to the fucking edge, I should be close to You
But who the fuck are You, You never showed the proof
And I'm only fucking human yo, what am I supposed to do
There's way too many different religions with vivid descriptions
Begging all fucking men and women to listen
I can't even beat my dick without getting convicted
These ain't wicked decisions, I got different intentions
I've been itching to get it, I've been given assistance
But the whole fucking system is twisted
Now I'm dealing with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
And I've been told that my sinful life is an addiction
But I can't buy it, it's just too hard to stand beside it
I need an answer and humans can't provide it
I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it
It's truly mind blowing, I can't deny it
Is heaven real, is it fake, is it really how I fantasize it
Where's the Holy Ghost at, how long's it take man to find it
My mind's a nonstop tape playing and I can't rewind it
You gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it
I'm frustrated and You provoked it
I'm not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it
I have a fucking brain, You should know it
You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment
It was a mission that I had to abort
'Cause humans be lying, we're such an inaccurate source
It's gon' be hard to put me back on the course
Next Jehovah's Witness to come on my porch, I swear I'm slammin' the door
A lot of folks believe it though, but I'm not surprised
Humans are fucking dumb, still thinking that 
 alive
I ain't trying to take your legacy and torch it down
I'm just saying: I ain't heard shit from the horse's mouth
Just sheep always telling stories of older guys
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
Now I'm supposed to bow my head and close my eyes
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise, sounds like a fucking poltergeist
Show yourself and then boom it's done
Every rumor's gone, I no longer doubt this shit, You‚Äôre the one
I'll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
And all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge
I'll donate to a charity that could use the funds
Fuck the club, instead of bitches I'd hang with a group of nuns
And everyone that I ran into would know what I came to do
I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of You
I hate the fact that I have to believe
You haven't been chatting with me like you did Adam and Eve
And I ain't seen no fucking talking snake unravel from trees
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
I don't know if you do or don't exist, it's driving me crazy
Send your condolences, this is me reaching to You so don't forget
If hell is truly Your pit of fire and I get thrown in it
I'ma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
My gut feeling says it's all fake
I hate to say it but fuck it, shit I done lost faith
This isn't a small phase, my perspective's all changed
My thoughts just keep picking shit apart all day
And in my mind I make perfect sense
If You aren't real then all my prayers aren't worth a cent
That would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is
And I could just sit in church and just say "fuck" in the services
Man what if Jesus was a facade
Then that would mean the government's god
I feel like they've been brainwashing us with a lot
So much that we don't even notice that we're stuck in the box
Man everything is ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù, why is it always ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù
Planet Earth ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù, the universe ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù
My sacrifice ‚Äúwhat if!?‚Äù, my afterlife ‚Äúwhat if!?‚Äù
Every fucking thing that deals with You is fucking suspect
I'm fucking done
I'm fucking done
This is my fucking life and I'm living it
I'm having fun
If You really care for me, prove that I need to live carefully
But I'll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside for an afterlife that isn't even guaranteed
We are You, and You're us, stop playing games
My life's all I got, and heaven is all in my brain
And when I feel I'm in hell, my ideas are what get me through pain
Do as You please, and I'll just do me
I'm a human, I'll stay in my lane

37,Ill Mind of Hopsin 9,2017,No Shame (2017),,Hopsin,"Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma
Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma (hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
Oh, hello son, I really wish I knew you
I'm your father you'll probably never be introduced to
You'll only see me on TV or maybe YouTube
But now I know your momma is probably dating some new dude
So how you liking Earth? Are you loving your existence?
I wasn't at your birth, 'cause your mother made me miss it
I tried to get a visa, I applied and they denied it
'Cause your momma told the police that I beat her, she was lyin'
And now I'm banned for something bad that I ain't even do
There's a lot of land and water separating me and you
You're far away in Australia and I am in America
So I cannot be there to do all of the things a parent does
This is my attempt at me raisin' you from a distance
You have Hopson in your blood, you are special and you are gifted
The punishment your mother has given me doesn't seem fair
Just know I love you, son, and I'm wishin' that I could be there
Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up (it's sad)
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)
Nope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma
Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up (yeah, that's it)
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
(That's why what?) (Hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
I know you and your mom are stayin' with her parents Bill and Kirsten
You're partially black, I'm confident they're feelin' nervous
They don't like colored people, in their eyes you're still a burden
They assume you gonna grow up shootin' guns and stealin' purses
But that's not true, son, don't be sad
I know you're not like that, you know I got your back
Listen, here's a funny joke that you could tell your grandmother
She looks like the Marshmallow Man from 
Oh, I forgot, you're too young to know what that is
But that's the kinda thing I like to say to plumpy fat chicks
The humps on Mom's chest are not real, they're elastic
And if you look closely you can see she's made of plastic
Like a toy, you my boy, my son, my friend
I promise we gon' be together somehow in the end
I am very ashamed that you don't have my last name
Every night I go to bed and I'm feelin' this wicked pain, because-
Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)
Nope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma
Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up (that's right)
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
(Daddy doesn't fuck with who?) (Hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
Currently my life has hit the floor
I can't lie to you, shit is hard
I should be buildin' with the Lord
It could be what I'm missin' or
Maybe I should continue to hurt your momma and diss her more
Just to relieve the tension that sits in my heart, 'cause it is sore
When I'm spittin' bars about all my cash and exquisite cars
This was on my vision and you were the one I did it for
My relationship with your momma is sittin' in the morgue
After all this hell, I can't lie, I do wish she did abort
Our lives are so unhappy
'Cause this world is cold and nasty
Just know your daddy don't condone havin' a broken family
I'm so sad we couldn't work out our issues 'fore you arrived
And now you have to suffer
'Cause Mom and Daddy have stupid lives
You're way too young to notice it
You don't deserve to go through this
If I do see your mom again, this time I will assault the bitch
At least then I'll feel like my bannin' was justified
Look at your momma, thank her for fuckin' up all our lives, and sing
Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)
Nope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma
Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up (Momma had to fuck it all up)
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
(Daddy doesn't fuck your momma) (Hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
Oh, son
I'm sorry I can't be there with you
But I'll be there soon
But Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (no, no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma

One word that explains the truth (Real)
Bang out till your brain is loose
All your little fun filled days are through
Remember that I'm like this thanks to you
First off I'm a little psycho, I know
Dumb like a mentally retarded kid
I ain't got no friends, no ends to my stress
So I chill in the dark and shit
With a rifle and bomb, knife in my palm
Thinking about the motherfucking lives I'mma harm
Swing at me then I'm slicing your arm
Then make you videotape me piping your mom
Ruthless!
Deceitful lies, listen up, you don't want beef to rise
I really wanna murder
I'm thinking of taking her out for a pizza slice
Then tie her ass up and then beat the life
Out her god damn skull till she bleeds and cries
The whole fucking time she was screaming ""Why?""
Fuck you bitch, don't be surprised!
Time after time you told me that my album would drop
It was all bullshit, then the day that it finally did
Bitch how come it flopped?
It's Ruthless baby for sho
I'm tryna make me some dough
Get off your ass and make a motherfucking marketing plan
And then maybe I'll blow
But NO!
You wanna be a little bitch about it
Thought that I would never do shit about it
You made a contract with a twist around it
So I could never, ever, ever get up out it
No outlet so I'm pissed about it
I'd be really dumb if I just allowed it
Watch your back, you might get surrounded!
Bang, bang, bang you hit the ground!

See, you be tripping like a nigga
That's walking with his shoes untied
Best believe I'ma set it straight
Tie a rope around both of your legs, then hook 'em to 2 cars
And drive till they separate
Now your soul's in the sky, try to levitate
Bitch you gon' live life in a better place
You done fucked me once, you done fucked me TWICE
Having me begging to drop must be NICE
Look at Eazy-E's lovely WIFE
Maybe the reason is my ugly EYES
I be the illest when I crush these MICS
But it never occurred that I must be WHITE
You're the reason I say ""fuck my LIFE""
I hate you bitch, it's a must we FIGHT!
Everybody keep on running around and asking
What do be doing with her time
I don't really know though
I just keep a low-pro, 'cause I'm mad with the contract I signed
I was so happy at first, then it turned to a curse
How'd it happen to me?
That's the question
I could not get the answer
So now I'm building a casket for (Tomica) to rest in
Bitch you ain't nothing but a big phony
Lying to niggas, saying you signed with Sony, bitch
None of the staff up there knows me
How come my rap career's moving so slowly, bitch?
Now I got big enough buzz to destroy you and Ruthless
You can't hold me, bitch
I'ma fuck around and put some steal toes on
And kick your ass in the ovaries, bitch!

I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
I hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?
I spend a long time tryna build the buzz
Hop is in the building, 'cause
Step to me up on this battlefield, you know I will erupt
Didn't change, I'm still a nut
The girls seen my skills are up
So I be gettin' head every single night like a pillow does
When a nigga be flow bashin'
You know I be keepin' it old fashioned
My compassion is so tragic on instrumentals when I toe tag it
Throw dirt on me? Then guard your face and stomach
'Cause I'm swinging on you like ya ass cheeks had a rope hangin' from it
I'm out my mind, I can't configure it
I'm way too niggerish
I tried to read the Bible but I'm straight illiterate
With anger temperaments
I put myself in strange predicaments
They labeled this as sick
The doctor says to take some Ritalin
Man, I'm a lunatic
Rockin' a crucifix
I'll mack on any chick I feel who got the cutest tits
I'm wanted, fugitive
Robbin' yo whip to cruise in it
See, I'm the only kid on Elm Street that Freddy Krueger skipped
Pants saggin' 'cause they too loose to fit
I'm torturous
Grab a hammer and nail for your front door and board it shut
I stare deep in ya eyes, rip out your soul and absorb it up
And have Biggie Smalls yellin' out ""call the coroner!""
My groupies stay horny
They always call to say ""Hopsin can you fly me out to Cali? Please pay for me""
I make that pussy pop for you like you skateboarding
Then you can come inside like a hurricane warning
I got a lot of sluts
I like to call it Hopsin luck
But now I feel like having sex with these bitches is not enough
I needed something new for moments when I gotta bust
So lately I've been beating my dick with a pair of boxing gloves
I got the maddest rhymes
How dare yo ass deny
I'll stab you in the brain with a knife
You can keep that in mind
You talkin' shit inside yo house?
Cool, fine, fuck it
I'll break in and stomp you out inside of it
Ain't tryna be ya friend
I'll knock you out and when you wake up
I'll just be standing there with a mischievous grin
Like ""Ha. We meet again""
I'll puncture yo skin with a crack fiend's syringe
And drill your nut sack to the seat you're in
You want props? You don't deserve it, you're not ill
I won't stop till every rapper lurkin' has got chills
Why these niggas actin' like they certainly pop steels
When only time they carry heat is serving a hot meal
Since I was young, been on a mission to make dough
And put all my niggas on like this shit was a slave boat
So tell me why your songs sound like skittles and rainbows?
That's a dead giveaway you love and listen to Wayne bro
I'm sick and deranged when I'm spitting this strange flow
Stuck my dick in the game, that's the business I came for
Witness my pain grow, I don't kick it with lame folks
Simple and plain though, you gon remember my name ho, ha!
Yo, check it
This that high school lunch time cypher
I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
I hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?
I'll snatch it from anyone when I dance with Satan
And detach more wigs than every female cancer patient that ever cared for a transformation
With a disjoint sweeter than a diabetic amputation
When I split niggas, clipped quicker than big pictures
Heads get bodied with a single line like a stick figure
'Cause my words are wild, and when I write
They can't wait for the sentence like family victims of a murder trial
Openly flow potently
Tighter than the choke-hold needed to put the Incredible Hulk to sleep
Tighter than the boatload of soldiers that stormed Normandy
Tighter than the hairy twat with the Virgin Mary's ovaries
They choke up like their throats cut when I show up
To keep the competition win-free like Oprah
'Cause when I work with Hopsin, everybody who's hip
Is getting kilt like a skirt from Scotland
Then I'll cock-back quicker than mouse traps
And stare as they pull out a hare like magicians tricking with Top hats
I got foreign objects
That'll get you capped in America like Marvel Comics
With a strap like star guitarists
When this lead of mine see a-head in time like Nostradamus
Or swift jabs that swing left like crip flags
Will be the reason you break necks like whiplash!
So who the fuck wants war with this?
Distorted thoughts morphed this author to Spartacus
When he balls his fists around the swords he lifts with the force of a horses kick
Multiplied by the reason why god exists, and makes Thor his bitch!
Horror flick like imagery, organs everywhere
You would swear I was orchestrating a Symphony!
It's passion, the force within him will cause the critics to look-n' drop dead like gorgeous women, hah!
Yo, check it
This that high school lunch time cypher
I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
I hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?
Don't get this shit confused
Your not a person your delicious food
No matter your place, birth, or religious views
All you niggas getting chewed
I eat a rapper, fitted cap first and then I spit out his tennis shoes
Missing screws in my top, I don't have the patience
I grab the chop and leave you niggas eradicated
I never let the doctor give me shots I'm unvaccinated
And I got small pox you can have a blanket
Get assassinated and get left with broken bones
If you go in the woods make sure you don't go alone
I'm fucking bitches in a mobile home
Like a mutated nigga from the hills have eyes with no Trojan on
This is paranormal activity with a dagger
I got paranormal tendencies y'all just a pair of normal rappers
So why you talking like you not defenseless?
I punch you ten times in the mouth
And have your pussy asses hoppin fences
I got suspended for a few weeks in the 8th grade
When the principal caught me on the street tryna spray paint
I bought a dozen eggs from Safeway
And threw them at the muthafuckas house on the same day
You can get it the same way
I'm making bitch niggas walk the plank
In crocodile infested water mixed with toxic waste
Bury you alive with a camera strapped across your face
Then come back 2 weeks later and watch the tape
You cried like a bitch trying to make the coffin break
You died like a bitch instead of trying to concentrate
I'm here to depopulate on the red carpet with a sniper rifle
Taking out any nigga you nominate
So if you see me as soon as you turn the news on
Chances are I laid a nigga down like a futon
While you at work dealing with groceries and coupons
I got your bitch tossing my salad pass the croutons
Yo, check it
This that high school lunch time cypher
I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
I hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?
Yeah hah! Took it back to lunchtime on these muthafuckas son!
Yeah, yeah, yeah Funk Volume"
42,Marcus' Gospel,2017,No Shame (2017),,Hopsin,"I done lost myself again
I done lost myself in sin
I've been burned by selfish men
I've been died but held it in
I do not want hell to win
Life's cold, I done felt the wind
Could it be any clearer?
When I look in the mirror
I just see a jackass with a tail to pin
Me and my family ain't close
So I got some fame and went ghost
I am not paintin' a hoax
You can hear the pain in my flows
They say that life has it's ups and downs
But why do I stay in the lows?
I don't like Marcus, I don't like Hopsin
I am ashamed of them both
You see, all that I have is my money
I had no idea that this was coming
I fell into the stereotype of a rapper
I'm how they package a dummy
This is my reality I embrace
I look back and I can see my mistakes
I just wish that I could rewind the days
I honestly don't want to be out of place
I guess we gotta face
All these issues like this as a human sometimes
Yes, I am losin' my mind
If you ever come to that conclusion, it's fine
Don't ignore all of the proof and the signs
I made my bed, I'ma lay in it
The thought is as soothin' as wine
Now all need is a suit and a tie, I tried
In my lowest times
I have failed to see
Sunny days are waiting
I'm in need of some company
God, please help this pain
'Cause I don't wanna ever see
This lonely road again
(This lonely road again)
Take it away, I want the peace, I want the happiness
I took a blindfolded shot, it was accurate
But in my heart I know I never asked for this
See, this life I'm in, it seem miraculous
Who knew I'd break a few bones when I tackled it?
It's been years and I still can't adapt to it
I cannot predict what my next chapter is
There's a hearse speedin' fast in the ashes and
I feel like I lay flat in the back of it
There's no love in my eyes, so look up in the sky
Bring me back like you did Lazarus
I can hear the devil whispering, ""Come play!""
Injecting me softly with numb pain
My fingers are covered in blood stains
It's torturing I see in my son's aid
But one day, that will all change
When the fog strays, it's a lost page
That had blown away into the hallways
In the land where the wild dogs play
When you're confined into a small space
You will know that that's enough to cause rage
I'ma kick until the fuckin' walls break
I don't know what made me walk straight
Into this fire, my soul is burnin' quick
I've been told this isn't permanent
Growin' up, my father made a lot of mistakes
I do not know why I didn't learn from his
Can you direct me to where the furnace is?
I need to do away with pain that's lurkin' and
Maybe figure out what my new purpose is
All these bad vibes are so discouragin'
In my lowest times
I have failed to see
Sunny days are waiting
I'm in need of some company
God, please help this pain
'Cause I don't wanna ever see
This lonely road again
(This lonely road again)
In my lowest times
I have failed to see
Sunny days are waiting
I'm in need of some company
God, please help this pain
'Cause I don't wanna ever see
This lonely road again
(This lonely road again)"

I hope I'm gambling right with all this rap shit
'Cause if I failed then I just wasted half of my life
And I'm a dropout, so that just means I'd have to shoot dice
Up on the corner with they line, or just stab you tonight

And most of you niggas just don't do none of that
I'm setting up a trap for these niggas to stumble over
Who thinkin' they up with Hova, these niggas ain't fucking sober
They not in they mind, and my style boggles the mind

You say I'm a nuisance and think I be playin' these games with your heart and not purposely bruise it
That's when I lose it and flip, put the blame all on you like it's all your fault
Now I'm goin' through your phone, you goin' through mine, and we wrestlin', I'm hopin' you don't call no cops
Baby, I love you, don't be jealous of females I know that I've meant down the way
You mention they name on a regular basis and you just be givin' the space in my brain
You'll look me straight in the face, swear that I'm stickin' my penis up in every girl that I'm friends with
And that's the moment I say, ""I don't even know why I'm in a relationship, I want to end it""
Let's just chill the fuck out, girl, we livin' in the same damn house
Everywhere I go, you go, and you go, I go, so what we naggin' about?
Shit, not a goddamn thing, maybe we just like to hear ourselves talkin'
We do it way too often, I think we both lost it
Our love just might be in the coffin, oh shit
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe

Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I feel like your parents don't like me, I hate that you tell 'em our problems
See, when I first met 'em I knew that they fell in love with me, but then I fell straight to the bottom
Now your daddy textin' me sayin' to fly you home and he bein' so passive aggressive
Then I'm like ""Sure you gon' pay for her ticket?"" That is the question, dammit I'm stressin'
I've been sufferin' from manic depression, baby it takes a real man to confess it
I don't care if you confront me with issues you got, just be careful with how you address it
'Cause sometimes you attackin' me the wrong way, and then my mind think the wrong way
Then all of a sudden I be actin' like I got no brain, and I'm doin' foul shit like it's okay
But don't say I ain't ever tryna make things better, you been the only focus since the day we met up
Every time we get into it, you got me wishin' that I never broke up with my girlfriend back in Maryada
You say I don't love you then I don't know what else to do
'Cause I don't want nobody else but you
I know that I've been hurtin' you and you've been hurtin' me

I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
Why do we fight so often?
These games are oh so ridiculous though we cannot let this shit get to us
We just need to focus on the brighter side so we can make it
And if you ain't doin' somethin' I like, then I promise you that I'ma be a little more patient
'Cause these bad vibes are contagious and our relationship is now breakin'
And I know, I know, I know your heart is constantly achin'
It's like I snatched it out of your chest and tore it up, just tore it up
And I, I played the bad guy towards you more than once, yes, more than once
Man, this shit be frustratin' me
If you ain't the one then who may it be?
We tried to make love, but we made a beast
Now we just stuck 'cause we can't agree
This is my heart, please take a piece
And put it in a safe place to remind you
There's a million other guys in the world to choose
But none of 'em will ever love you like I do, baby
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me

So you keep 'em around, hoping that the sun gon' shine
Ain't no harm and I'mma give this nigga one more try
And then they screw you again and you like, fuck no, why?
And that's the second you know that you gotta cut those ties
Man they been taking advantage of you, aiming they madness at you
You can't even tell 'em, they unable to handle the truth
They full of shit, you gotta spend a day scrambling through
Telling me you sorry, I'm like uh uh, that isn't new
That's when you gotta turn your back and put your foot down
If you put up with it, you gonna get put out, nigga don't you wuss out
See I've been boxing with this issue for some good rounds
My circle is smaller, come take a look 'round, I'm good now
If you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
Ooh, y'all never gave a fuck about me
Never gave a fuck about me, oh no
I said if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
I'll never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever give a fuck about you
You ever dated a woman that held you back?
She ain't making no moves, you like, yo where the hell you at?
Life is valuable girl, I shouldn't have to tell you that
Cause you grew up with some bums who knew nothing but selling crack
She'll tell you that she'll do better and convince you
You move her in with you to fix the issues, you assuming it's gonna be simple
But shit didn't change, now there's something deadlier emerging
And her situation just became a heavier burden
Now your life is more than crazy, you fighting on the daily
Man it's time for her to go, you done decided, no debating
Cause there ain't no light shining on the future
She wasted all my time and all my mula
And she ain't even grateful for the cheddar I blew
Eff it, I'm through, bitch, I'm no longer messing with you
You ain't nothing but good for nothing, that's what evidence proves
And now you're just another topic when I step in the booth, bitch
If you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
Ooh, y'all never gave a fuck about me
Never gave a fuck about me, oh no
I said if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
I'll never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever give a fuck about you
See life's just a crazy cycle
What repeats itself, I know
As I grow, I learn from all the mistakes I made
Shit, I'm better on my own
You've got a lot of niggas around and they'll cut you
It's important that you learn to say fuck you
Yeah, they never gave a fuck about me, oh, na, na, na
This is the last laugh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Man I don't get involved with these phonies no more
I just open the door, and kick 'em all out, I don't keep 'em close
Been through this shit too much, you don't even know
Damn, you used to be the trophy of my life, but now that trophy is broke
And now you're wondering why I don't text back or call you
I deleted you out of my phone, bitch, who are you?
Pay attention close, I hope I come clear
Bitch, if you looking for a fuck, you won't find one here
'Cause if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
Ooh, y'all never gave a fuck about me
Never gave a fuck about me, oh no
I said if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
I'll never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever give a fuck about you
I got no more fucks to spare
I got no more fucks to spare

48,No Hope,2015,Pound Syndrome (2015),,Hopsin,"I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me
I'm fucking tired of playing God when you in need
The choices you made are on you completely, what's it got to do with me?
You mobbing through the streets, clueless but it's not like you could see
You know I'm cool, so you take it like it's an opportunity
To get some free money, damn you ain't got no shame
You been living off of my dough, bitch I'm not your bank
You be asking to borrow knowing that you not gon' pay
Abusing the privilege my nigga, that is not okay
Why don't you get it? I shouldn't have to explain it
Our foundation should be on some real shit, not you asking for payments
So create a dream, then get off your ass and then chase it
I'm mad and frustrated dealing with this shit, I'm lacking the patience
You the homie, I don't mind you coming around dog
But I should not have to pay for your downfall
Choose your faith, but still even if your day seem great
Just know I got your fucking back either way, you already know
I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me
Now my own family tripping, I ain't think I would get this shit from siblings
The money I'm making is yours right? It's a given
Let me tell y'all why I get a different feeling
Y'all was living good watching me and my momma struggle once we get the bills in
I don't recall any help or sympathies
Since 15 I been paying rent, you know what that did to me?
Could have been here, had this rap shit popping off, if y'all had lent the hand
But y'all wasn't worried 'bout helping us, you had a different plan
Focused on yourself, and now you holding on for help
You were self centered, and that was just an open door to hell
Oh, you need some money now, yeah of course I know the deal
You want the benefits without playing the courses on the field
You ain't even doing your best or trying
Don't ask me for shit unless you dying, this is me testifying
Just know that when your bright days going straight
I couldn't have your back without feeling strange but you already know
I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?
Without me
Money can leave you isolated 'cause people are shady
So why debate it? They love cash and fantasize to make it
To get it, we'll fight and break shit, develop unrighteous ways
Even taking the side with Satan, thankfully I've awaken
Foes who abused the privilege by having those who were gifted
Around them close and they vision, stop corroding your friendships
Don't be having your hands out, smiling, hoping to get shit
Mooching off of a man's treasure is bogus and it's just
Not the way you should function with brothers when you're amongst 'em
That is what we call punk shit and it can leave you stuck in
A boat that's already sunken, this can happen to anyone
Sisters, brothers and cousins, they disrespecting, then fuck 'em
That's the way that the fountain leaks, keep on pushing your boundaries
In due time I am bound to see all the snakes that surrounded me
I know that if my brightest days turn gray
You wouldn't have my back unless there was pay, it ain't no secret
I've been there when you needed me the most
Had your back when you were broke
I've shown you love when there's no hope
You were my friend, like blood
Like brothers, like family
And I say damn
Where would you be without me?

51,Nocturnal Rainbows,2010,RAW (2010),,Hopsin,"You think you original?
You ain't original, you were programmed to be you.
You're a slave and you don't even know it.
The shit you think of ain't even your thoughts.
Let's step out the box for a minute.
How do we know if God exists?
How do we know what's positive?
Are you the definition of an angel or the opposite?
If you lost your wallet and I found it, I would not commit to stealing it
But if the tables turned then you would pocket it
See I been me for so long, but I still don't know who Hopsin is
How come I'm the one my teachers used to have a problem with?
I show my music to different labels, they ain't too fond of it
But in the underground I seem to get so many compliments
Say my name and it's like people get afraid and shook
But if you take a look you'll see I'm nothing like an angry crook
I'm learning hands-on, you busy with your face in books
I'm here to benefit the world so Heaven's where we're safely put
I'm not a devil, not speakin' in tongues
I just wanna touch your heart, I try to reach it in songs
I'm from where a child's future's in the streets with the bums
Because it's hard to become something so unique where I'm from
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows
Obama's president, so? What's he represent?
Just because the nigga's half black don't mean he's Heaven-sent
You're clueless to evidence and all the minds he's messin' with
His charm and smile hasn't got my ass up out this debt for shit
Frontin' like he's truly Jesus
And all you fools believe it
The change he's making isn't good, that's just how you conceived it
It's like we all broker than ever, it's due to reasons
Dealing with self-beneficial plans and the movement he's with
Illuminati, or whatever the fuck they go by
They're the reason weird shit happens, and we don't know why
Why did Michael Jackson start his tour than have to go die?
How did rap music go from really good to so dry?
Real artists get shelved and wack one's get famous
To leave masses brainless, a smart mind is dangerous
In their eyes there probably ain't no real shit in your playlist
You're just a product of what the government has created
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows
Yo, we're all smart and we know what's bad and good for us
But yet when you got offered some marijuana, you took a puff
Your brain's a fucking powerhouse, but what? That wasn't good enough?
It's people like you who talk that ""should've, could've, would've"" stuff
You probably threw your life away 'cause you would rather get high
With no license or car, so you bum rides to get by
Saying ""I should've did this"" or ""I shouldn't have hung with this guy""
""I'm broke as fuck, my rent's high. Ah, I should've realized""
I ain't being cruel, these situations that I address
I more than likely could be someone you admire, yes
But it's because the blood, sweat and all the time that I invest
We play the same game, difference is you never try your best
You don't have a skill, you set yourself up for a higher mess
I work around the clock, you slack off a lot for time to rest
Keep bullshittin' till your life is gone
'Cause living's naturally hell, you have to work to put a smile on
When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high"

Paramedics saved yo ass
You was close to ghost
You never did know which road to go

But you sank like the Titanic
The incident had left your life damaged
And that's when I panicked
You thought you had it locked?
Well you ain't on the right planet
If you tryna live your life right, plan it
It's like your mind vanished
Ain't you don't even know that
I wish that we could go back
'Cause it's so sad when I tell jokes and you don't laugh like you used to
I really hate to stress it but you're strange to mess with
So I keep my distance cause you always got this blank expression
Like you confused and unaware of your surroundings
Emotions are gone, and no one's found it
It's overwhelming
Yo mama told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen till the fire burned yo ass now you understand!
You always look like you don't know me
And I'm mad at the world cause the meth took away my homie
Gimme back my homie, Please come home!
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block like we used to
Where'd you go?
I never would've thought my best friend would be gone in the future
(But I was wrong...)
I shoulda stopped you when I had the chance to do so!
But back then I had felt like that was too bold
You started hanging with new folks
And made the drug environment your new home
This world is too cold
Could I have prevented this?
Who knows
They convinced you that the shit was cool and it's the hip to do
Saying it would lift your mood and make you feel invincible
So you started skippin' school, hangin' with these wicked dudes
Unaware that when you got older you played the bigger fool!
And it's pitiful, where the fuck they at now?
In they mid twenties, passed out inside of a crack house
Back when you met 'em I had doubts
They put you on a bad route
And when you needed they help to pick you up, they fuckin' backed out!
They fuckin' got you, I can't lie
But now you're brains fried
You don't even act like you the same guy
Yo mama told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen till the fire burned yo ass now you understand!

I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block like we used to
Where'd you go?
I never would've thought my best friend would be gone in the future

I ain't never felt this shit before
It gets me sore
I reminisce on us playin' Nintendo 64
And that Christmas in '97 we got new crispy boards
And we was doin' Ollie's in my kitchen on the slippery floors
Shit changed, and it happened quick
But I can't forget that you was the first homie I started rappin' with
You coulda had half of this back when I had established it
But now I have to sit and feel bad
Look at what yo actions did
But you were so outgoing, and so hysterical
Seein' you now is just unbearable
It's terrible
You shoulda made yo choices wisely
Fuckin' with Poison Ivy
Without yo brain, please tell me, what would your point in life be?
It's a struggle to get yo ass to listen
You really hurt me and the rest of your family with all your bad decisions
We always told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen till the fire burned yo ass, now you understand...
But you always look like you don't know me
And I'm mad at the world cause the meth took away my homie
Gimme back my homie, Please come home!

They gon' whoop my ass if they find out I'm from the Valley
My whole crew is cocky, homie, nobody could stop us
Chillin' on Tobias Avenue sippin' horchata
Shootin' pellet guns at cars until we saw the coppers
Once we got confronted we would lie and say it's not us, gotcha
A decade later I only grew worse
Niggas say they hate me, that's cool, I hated you first
The truth hurts, I guess it's just a few perks

She's so obese I take her out and make her stay in the car
Her body odor always smelling like some bacon and farts
I tell her ha don't eat pork she takes it straight to the heart
Ready to make a song, she needa make a fat with it (eh)
The farm, that's where she belong, better leave me alone, calling me and asking where I'm at
Like she needs to know
A what a surprise, she thinking I'm the lover of her life, becoming my wife
Listen to me take some advice, you wanna look nice, trust me I'm right
Go the Motherfuckin gym and loose the gut and your fine
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen

Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen

They must of thought id never remember to pass to it
Forget school man I never could pass threw it
I never be the student ahead of the class who gets an A in his report card
A nice kid whose so smart
Seem like they threw me in special ed it got more hard
Every year the cycle repeats over again
My friends graduated and I'm way older then them
Then they come to me nice mugging me
Making fun of me
What a resignedly of motherfuckin you thinking what they Uh

Like a freaking cycle then what's it gonna be
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen

56,Pillow Man,2010,RAW (2010),,Hopsin,"I've spent about ten years tryna work on my craft
Tryna save this hip-hop shit and disperse of the trash
But all my nerves have just crashed, 'cause all the verses I've thrashed
Were meant to benefit my future, I'm uncertain it has
I rarely ever put something out to insert in your dash
'Cause as soon as I became a brand my own purpose was smashed
I'm feelin' nervous in fact, I got no urges to rap
I don't think my fucking life can get more worthless than that
I see these niggas blowing up, who never took out the proper game
Niggas who fucking suck, Gucci and Wacka Flocka Flame
Niggas who makin' bucks, someone tell me I'm not insane
'Cause I feel the urge to run up on a bitch ass nigga then rob his chain
Dang! I thought I had it figured out
See I panic and I pout, yo I've had it man, I'm out
God damn it, this shit's a clout
I'm the baddest thing no doubt
But my madness is about to turn me manic till I shout
How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me
Won't somebody tell me, you can go ahead, and fall asleep
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream
You all assume I'm evil, but actually I'm so nice
I've always been the lover boy like practically my whole life
Unhappy here with no wife, don't ask me I don't know why
I'm livin' life without no type of strategy to go by
I knew a bitch who I would go pick up when the day starts
A bitch who'd even like to watch me skate at the skate park
A bitch who I was making out with up in the graveyard
The same bitch who went and left my ass with a slayed heart
She cut it like an avocado, secretly hittin' clubs and poppin' bottles
Hanging with thugs and sucking lots a cock yo
The biggest slut from Loveland Colorado
Fuck a ho that's Hopsin's motto my heart is vacant, you knock it's hollow
She met another guy who left a baby stuck inside
Her vagina then he just split and messed up her fuckin' life
Now she hits me up and I say, ""Go suck a nut, goodbye""
All you sluts can die for wasting all my sacred love supply
How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me
Won't somebody tell me, you can go ahead, and fall asleep
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream
To live a decent life what all is it take
I tried and try to be the best but nothing falls in the place
And I'm a man but my struggle is gonna cause me to break
And just involve me to hate I'm in a nauseous state
And shit it probably is fate but who's in control of it me or God
Is he the cause of why am I here the reason's odd
I'm broke and need a job, for spending cheese on broads
But y'all don't see the flaws I code it up to keep it raw
And MC's who's got the most talent in this whole planet
Don't ever get recognized when they dope at it
So they go back to the block hustlin' and dope addicts
Some niggas got the effect and some niggas don't have it
Yo I'm at my last years 'cause every time I think I'm out the matrix
I get sucked right back in
But man I'm hopin' things will change and the soul in me remains
'Cause the talent that I've got is way too cold to be contained
No, no
What did I do to deserve this?
No, no
I don't even have a purpose
No, no
What did I do to deserve this?
No, no
I don't even have a purpose
How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me
Won't somebody tell me, you can go ahead, and fall asleep
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream"

All my fans are feeling intimate
This shit isn't a coincidence
Treated this game like a glory hole all I did was stick my dick in it (Yeah)
I do not believe in discipline, niggas think I be magician and
I never needed nobody's opinion or
Cosigning whatever my decision is
Rap is all that I had in the rough conditions
I bought The Chronic - the deluxe edition
I heard Eminem on ""What's The Difference""
I was like oh snap what the fuck is this shit?
My homie Justin played Crooked I
When he had made a remix to the song initially
I kid you not it blew my mind
I do not lie
Since then I've been on a mission
To be down with rap until my mind corrodes
I'm dedicated with my life and soul
When I be giving my all till I die and I lie below
Please bury me with the microphone
I ride alone through the night as I flow my pain
Now the whole world know my name
A whole lot changed
I'm givin' everybody more I tame
And you can see it from the dough I gain

One minute you're on top, the next minute you might flop

Feels like a movie, real lies, I'm truth
Blessed the ways you ain't yesterday, it's too late yesterday
You straight kill time, profusely
Go hard there no excuse
I get a shot then I won't get loose
But I won't let you
Trying to take advantage of my heart or skills nigga, no can do
Bitches I'm a boss now, the pushover been tossed out

Even though I come off as a goofy nigga
I assure you I'm what you should not clown
I'm too hard to digest

And let me leave your mind corrupt from this song
See you can't stop me 'cause I'm a brainwash teens
And create false dreams cause it pays off clean
I'm just an idiotic ironic symbolic illuminatic product
That's gonna be killed if I talk about it (shhh!)
This industry business is all screwed up
I have no favorite rapper because all you suck
I severe the weakest niggas who not on my pedigree
Because on the tombstone its as hard as it will ever be
I'm judged by my wild image a lot
And everybody seems to think I have a sinister plot, I do
Be offended by every sentence I jot
I got some militant thoughts and you ain't killin' em'
Off so listen

61,Sexy Cyber,2009,Gazing At The Moonlight (2009),,Hopsin,"Cyber, sexy cyber, sexy cyber (I love her)
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl, cyber
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber (I love her)
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl.
Can you believe it, she's finally about to meet her soul mate
It's still trippin' her out, she's like no way
No more sad lonely nights of straight horror
Tomorrow she's meeting the lover God made for her
She's looking in the mirror dancing around the house
With a mess of clothes on the bed trying on outfits
She's acting out how the day is probably gonna be
Like hi Pete I'm so glad we finally get to meet
She thinks to herself
Hmm I know what I should do
I'm a call Nicole up and tell her all the good news
It went to voice mail cause Nicole was sleeping
So Lauren left a message, like girl I'm gonna see him
She hangs up and falls back on the bed smiling
Looking at the ceiling, daydreaming in dead silence
Eventually her daydreaming turns into sleep
It's love that she's feeling and yes the feeling is sweet.
Cyber, sexy cyber, sexy cyber (I love her)
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber, sexy cyber (I love her)
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber, she's my sexy cyber girl.
It already hit morning, oh darn
But Lauren so excited she wakes up before the alarm
And calls Pete, to see exactly where there gonna meet
Then Pete picks up and tries to act like he wasn't sleepin'
Lauren's like so where we meeting at
We could try my place
Pete's like nah how about TGI Fridays
I really love you Lauren and I know you trust me
But it's our first time meeting I don't wanna rush things
She says that's fine I'll see you at twelve
Until then I love you baby hope you'll be doing well
She takes a shower, does her hair and all that girl stuff
Make-up, lip stick, neck and wrist pearled up
Now it's about time she heads on out to tease
She text messages Pete, hey I'm about to leave
And she's so damn excited as her heart pounds beats
That she almost left her house without her keys, geez.
Cyber, sexy cyber, sexy cyber (I love her)
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber, sexy cyber (I love her)
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl.
She pulls up but Pete hasn't arrived yet
Should she go in without him
She hasn't decided
She doesn't really know how he would act if she tried it
So she just sits back and just relaxes her eyelids
It's 12: 20 Lauren picks up an appetite
She decides to go inside without him and have a bite
Then the phone rings, it's Pete so she answers it
Pete says baby I'm gonna have to cancel it
Lauren says why?, what happened?, what is it?
Then Pete says I just heard my grandmother's real sick
And I have to go and give her a visit
Then Lauren says it's okay baby, go handle your business
She loves him too much so it didn't really bother her
She hops in the car pulls off, a truck follows her
But she don't even notice cause her music's too loud
And she just caught up in the zone of a Ludacris album
Now she's home, she opens the door, moves to get out
Soon as the foot hits the ground
A man rushes up and pushes her down
She drops her keys, the man picks 'em up
Then drags her by her feet into her house like he don't give a fuck
He slapped her, then put tape on her mouth to take from the sound of Lauren
Screaming rape really loud, he's going ballistic
Her face is covered with lipstick
Then he yells out bitch Pete never existed
Her heads spinning, then she just faints
The man rips off her clothes and Lauren gets raped
From that day on nobody ever heard from her
Cause that so called Pete guy went and murdered her
He tossed her body in a off-road ditch
And said to her see you at the crossroad bitch.
Cyber, sexy cyber, sexy cyber (I love her)
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber, sexy cyber (I love her)
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl."
62,Slurpin,2009,Gazing At The Moonlight (2009),,Hopsin,"I don't like girls who always in the lime light
I don't like girls who think that I rhyme tight
I don't like girls who tryin' to be in my life (fuck that)
Let me tell you the kind of girls that I like
I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
I like the ones who like slurpin' (slurpin')
'Cause I like girls who like slurpin' (slurpin')
Work it when you slurp it, make sure that you jerk it
And swallow it and then burp it, once it has been inserted
Maybe I will give you a pat on the back if it is worth it (thanks)
Stick this sword inside your mouth like it was a circus
I wanna Slurpee and sticky when you get jiggy with licking me physically it will be like a paradise (dise)
While you doing that you can put my scrotum inside of your palm and maybe play with them like their a pair of dice (dice)
That'll be nice to have every night I'm sure that I'd be walking around with a happier life
Girl come over here snack on my pipe (But I want chicken) bitch beef stick is what you're having aight now shut up
So don't be trying to fight it, open your mouth and let me slide it inside it, but don't be trying to bite it
Or we'll be fighting tonight and then you'll be crying and trying to call the ambulance sirens and I'll just say that you lying ha
Slurp it like you about to finish a soda
And keep on doing it through out the night until it is over
Just don't shake it up a lot or else the fizz will get on ya
Here, my soda is so delicious isn't it Sonya
Oh yes it is, a matter of fact, you can have the rest of it
Let your lips just caress it, and rest against it it's heaven biotch
And you can keep your mouth open 24 hours 7 days out the week like your ass was 7/11 biotch
My shit is alright, full of caffeine keep you up all night
Make your life all bright
Don't know what you heard, shit
You feeling thirsty, you can get first dibs 'cause baby girl you deserve this
More than anyone slurp it soon as your Henny's done
When your done you can try some of the little homies when he comes
Just sip it up like he don't give a fuck don't be giving up
Then I will zip it up, when you want more you can hit me up
Just like Clinton does, sure that every nigga does
She don't want to do it then give her something to get her buzzed
Now it's on, ""hey can I try some,"" Hell nah, that's how these niggas get pounded on
Homie, only for women who love sippin' and lickin' and ticklin' and jigglin a big one up in 'em that's not for boys man
And don't be stepping to be, or you will definitely be resting in peace if your swinging that way, I ain't your boyfriend
Girls, you ain't got to get all greedy with each other trying to throw it down
'Cause there is enough Slurpee to go around
Got brains? Use them, I got enough to give you some, you some, you some, you some
I hope I didn't leave anyone out
And if I did put here stick this straw end up in your mouth
It's so tasty baby isn't it
I don't see how any women out there could get sick of it"
63,Still Got Love for You,2013,Knock Madness (2013),,Hopsin,"You left me and you went home to Indianapolis
If I wanted, I'd be getting plenty of ass and tits
But I want you can you send me an answer quick?
Lost in your love baby give me a map to this
Never knew what love felt like till I met you
My heart wasn't for any other woman except you
But you stabbed it till it bled through
Now my head screwed 'cause I should've been the one who had left you
Accepted our break I really wasn't that pleasant
But I learned to deal with it and didn't ask questions
No point in making the past present
But after a month and a half, you was a month and a half pregnant
Damn, my heart taken badly now I'm a situation dealing with another baby daddy
Sad part about it yo, it's not even my kid
Evidence proves you really out of your mind bitch
I swear I thought you was my lady
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good girl
You ain't no good for me
I'm in shock like feeling like a crazy movie
I really don't appreciate the way you do me
Since I got your news I been dating groupies
But they never last all they want is fame and jewelry
These gold-diggers can't recruit me
I keep running back to you as if the pain is soothing
'Cause the bond we had is something I got used to
My mom is telling me to say bye-bye screw you
You ain't even in love with the guy you having a kid with
When I think about it I get sick, you did this
Clubbing with your friends and drinking till you get senseless
Should've thought about this shit before you sipped it
You put faith into his dick
And now you pregnant by a dipshit, life is all twisted
Our world could've been terrific
But the Hopsin bus passed baby, and you missed it
I swear I thought you was my lady
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good girl
You ain't no good for me
Now ain't no reason to be smiling for
I'm always the type looking down on whores
And even though the goddamn child is yours
You know I still got your back on child support
'Cause we both know you don't make enough for day care
That should've been my baby, what the fuck this ain't fair
Call if you need me that's fine by me
But the jealousy killing me that's not my seed
I don't know why I take this crap from you, break my back for you
I can't adapt to you, we ain't compatible, face the facts it's true
But when you lost why do I make a path for you?
I spent a long time working at making our love tighter
But you sipping J√§germeister, and having these one nighters
I'll never be able to trust you
My nigga Tecca Nina said it best I love you, but fuck you
Oh no no no, you played your games and now we'll never be the same
See I love you, but I hate you, and I hate the fact I still love you
Yeah yeah, oh why oh why
I swear I thought you was my lady
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good girl
You ain't no good for me"

I'm a tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be and you rocking with the H-O-P
Pay attention closely to my story (all right)
Mom ain't never had shit, neither did pop
And that's exactly the reason that he beat her a lot
So shit, as a kid I had to be a cheater and rob
Dealing with the consequences of me getting caught
Life appeared to be cool when I was young 'cause I didn't notice things
Rent was paid every month with no problems so it seems
And as I got older I would catch onto things
Then I start to notice that shit ain't the way it's 'posed to be
Come to find out we've been up in a rut
My mom feeling like she got a knife stuck in the gut
And dad tripping out for no reason cussin and stuff
I'm trying hard sucking it up like fuck it it's sus
And Christmas in the house was not that popular
'Cause all we ever receive was socks and boxers
My friend got a power ranger toy and a megazoid
It was official market on our fucking family four
Y'all now in the place to be and you rocking with the H-O-P
I'm a tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be and you rocking with the H-O-P
Pay attention closely to my story (all right)
When I was 17 my dad moved out
He refused to try help for us get a brand new house
So that just me, my mom and my sister
And it was up to me to be the man to polish our future
We was slowly falling apart
I felt the pain all in my heart
When my mom would go and crawl in the dark
And cry lungs out 'cause she knew that our good times was up now
I ain't know how to deal with none of it I was strung out
Finally my 18th birthday hit
I would had left, but I had to help her pay rent
My homies got their own place, they living very nice
Sipping on some Bacardi and throwing parties every night
They mom buying cars, new 3-50 Z's
Well my moms in debt, at least 50 G's
That means I have to work harder just to get by, 'cause if I don't we'll be struggling for the rest of our lives, fuck!
Y'all now in the place to be and you rocking with the H-O-P
I'm a tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be and you rocking with the H-O-P
Pay attention closely to my story (all right)
God I hate to cuss to you, but I hate my fucking life
Nothings right it's cold in my world, it's never summer time
It is a test giving me this mediocre lifestyle
If I'm a get then it needs to happen right now
I'm one week away from jumping off a cliff
Or putting heat up to my head, and then dumping off a clip
I know you think I'm just lying, 'cause last time I stood next to a cliff side, I bitched out but I'm a do it this time
Man forget it, we both know I'm not
I just say that stupid shit 'cause I'm so low on gaup
But for real tho, God man you have to help me out, 'cause I know the road I'm rolling on is not a healthy route
From now to back to the day I was a little kid, shit didn't brighten up a little bit
Now wouldn't you be a little pissed if this was you
Yeah I'm cursing this the truth
Looks like I'm a have to resort to violence to get the loot
Y'all now in the place to be and you rocking with the H-O-P
I'm a tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be and you rocking with the H-O-P
Thank you for listening to my story (all right)"

Niggas acting like that they hate to show love, till they find out what I'm capable of

Me and my girl keep arguin'
Somehow my life just got hard again
She's scared of groupies that steady bargin' in
I can't explain the pain my heart is in
Yeah I got money, but reality isn't sunny, it's dark and grim
See when I'm tour I don't take her
So she can feel what anger, thinkin' that another woman is gon' replace her
She standing in tears of emotion knee deep
I keep tryna tell her ""Why? I ain't fuckin' no groupie!""
She don't believe me
My career is so deceiving
She's dating a rapper, nobody said it was gon' be easy
She threaten' to leave me 'cause of these text messages girls sent
Now I'm just caught in this whirlwind
Tryna explain they just friends who can't control themselves
They see the fame, think I'm cute, and they get overwhelmed
She should fuckin' know the deal
I'm done dealing with this bull shit
Bitch, I'm outta here, you can go to hell!
There's no room to dive at the end of the road
When you're living in the cold not wearing a coat
The breeze turns tears to snow
The underground ain't been the same since I emerged from it
Niggas hear my name and they just hatin' throw some dirt on it
Talking bout I blew up and just left them in the dust
But, we ain't friends mothafucka we ain't neva kicked it once
You better zip it shut, I'm respectful
But, if I spot you that's the only time that I won't ever give a fuck!
Your words can make a difference, do not forget
If you run your mouth and talk shit, you payin' for what comes out of it
Bitch niggas acting all macho jealous 'cause they ain't got dough
While they still won't put enough for me at my show
Smiling coming over to me like I'm the coldest MC
And then you bad mouth the moment I leave!
Aight, I got it since I'm in the limelight
You niggas try to look cool by not being hyped about my height
Simple and plain, better watch where your missiles are aimed
Insult my name you'll rekindle a flame, nigga"

Back then all my homies said that you was just a setup
My mind was still been going, damn, my momma taught me better
I just wanted you baby
I don't know what to do lately
It's like I hate you and you hate me
And all this shit is too crazy for me
You got enough pride for the both of us
You can't apologize, you don't open up

Like sing me one of those songs? Like, like one of the cool ones?
Man I got to go man I'm not tryin' to sing...
Please?
All right, all right all right...
It's the B Bop, my B Bop song
Do the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong
Come on!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!
Ayo it's time to bring the West back, pass me the exlax
So I can shit on all these niggas when I wreck tracks
Your flow ain't that ill, I think you should adjust that
Homie I don't mean to be rude to you, it's just that
You ain't the first nigga I seen with an attitude
Up on the mic tryin' to explain what the gat'll do
Your skills won't get you that place up in Malibu
You better off tryin' to go slang with a bag of fruit
And leave it up to me, I got the bubblies
I'll do in an hour what would take your ass a couple days
My contacts make the ladies fall in love with me
He's the joker of rap is what these motherfuckers say
I'm slightly psychotic and idiotic but modest whenever spotted
So logically I'm a prophet, face it niggas you just suck
And as far as your game, it ain't never had legs to step up

Man I'm tired of the ghetto, hope I make it out this place
Ill niggas running around like an ape up out the cage
And it ain't about the change, man these things are not the same
All these killers wanna leave my brain laying on the pave
And I ain't did nothing, all these little kids cussing
Learning from their big cousins how to go and get stuck in
A correctional facility, messing up their liberty
Acting a fool making unnecessary enemies
Yes it's very weird to me, I did not get caught in it
I was into rap, for some reason I love the art of it
I ain't never drank or smoked because I'm smarter than
That and I didn't want to grow up to be what my father is
Gotta make a living, got plans of moving out the hood, not stayin in it
I hate these cheap apartments, and these vague complaining attendants
Roaches in the kitchen but I ain't really trippin', I'll be rolling in a minute, singin'
It's the B Bop, my B Bop song
Do the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong
Come on!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!
On the mic I burn niggas and turn rappers to singers
I learn that on the day I confirmed I was the slayer
I serve packs of these haters my words actually rape 'em
And where's daddy to save him? My urge has to be fatal
Up in this music shit the sky's the limit for rising in it
Long as I'm consistent and keep on using my eyes as gimmicks
I'mma be the talk of the town, walking around
Like ""Yes this rap game, I'm the boss of it now""
It's the B Bop, my B Bop song
Do the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong
Come on!

Yeah, I promised you niggas an album
You've been patiently waiting now the day is finally present
I took my time with this shit
I put my mind into every line
'Cause when it's out I ain't tryna regret it
Niggas get overhyped and all they hits go stale
Because they shit don't sell
Now that's a big old fail
But the punch is a lot harder when you clip your nails
Niggas, how you expect to drive when you ain't get your L's?
You was the next big thing while I was last
You was popping tags while I was mad
Chilling in my pad with my rhyming pad
Tryna record with no door so I hear my mom and dad
Arguing upstairs so I gotta wait till the drama pass
'Cause my mic be picking that shit up
But I ain't wanna give up
I'd exhale fast even if I did suck
You want the madness then come and get some
I'm taking the cake
And all that's left for y'all is the pieces I bit from
See I ain't buddy-buddy with rappers because that shit is fake
Most of y'all morals is fucked up, we on a different page
You get no props just 'cause you getting paid
If you garbage we ain't doing business, point blank, I discriminate
And I don't do no bullshit collabs to get my name popping
I ain't even consider the safe option
And I just say Hopsin, I paid homage, now I'm straight wildin'

With your work ethic it ain't gon' ever come
You had the XXL cover in 2012
And I thought you would soon prevail
But nigga, you ain't doing well
You hit us with that Ill Mind shit
And that was cool as hell
But when it comes to your album
You ain't ever got no news to tell
Your whole career is just a train wreck
You toured around the world for 3 years
But you always performed the same set
I been asked you to come to my city
But you ain't came yet
I guess you ain't in it for love
You just want that pay check
If I was you, then I wouldn't be too proud
You signed Dizzy not too long ago
And he's bigger than you now
You said you saving hip hop
Well save this shit
And all I hear is wack niggas
And I hate this shit
Homie I stopped being a scrub because of you
I stopped playing these bitches in the club and fell in love because of you
My dad heard your song and he stopped doing drugs because of you
I learned to rap and even built a lil buzz because of you
But you take it for granted thinking you have it made
Sitting back in the shade
Hopsin, there's people that you have to save
This is beyond music
You speak life into these motherfuckers
Hop, you have a gift, so when you gon' use it?""
Damn, I have that much of an impact?
My rhymes did that?
Sometimes, I really feel my shit's wack
That's why I kick back
But fuck this shit, yo where my pen at?
I'm about to kill this shit and make niggas just wanna quit rap
I'm causing havoc
Laying the rappers like a hammock
If I want the fucking planet, I can have it
Now try to snatch it
Only God can stop my violent habits
You niggas average
I ain't even in my prime and still I'm twice the savage

I'm a new route for these emcee's
This is a drought that's coming
I'm about to sprout to start a new style's full of envy
I need to cool down what is in me
Everything I had bottled up pukes out when the pen bleeds
You drown from a 16, who's doubtin' the sick steeze?
I could spit a wild verse without taking a breath
Then crowd surf, who's helping this kid breathe?
The worlds against me so I gotta come harder than the average
Think smarter than the masses
Everybody's on the move, ain't no time to get caught up in the traffic
When shit goes down I got the heart of an assassin
This here's harder than my last shit
Gotta do it now, no luck in tomorrow if it crashes
If I do die before I awake, I don't think too many will feel sorrow for my ashes
With this song I've frozen time, don't skip this, don't rewind
The throne is mine, close your eyes as I provoke the mind
This was bound to happen before I wrote the lines
And it's so divine the way my influence multiplied
It's like I created a cult inside this rap industry
Please don't look so surprised
I'm at the top, I ain't throwing down a rope to climb, come on
Pound, pound, pound, pound
It's the Pound Syndrome
Good God the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound
Un-unbelievable Pound Syndrome
Can you, can you, ca-can you believe it?
The Pound, the-the-the-the-the
The pound, the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound"

You can cry me a river 'cause I'm a dog and you know that shit

I'm the rap maniac with the hooligan eyes, who's cooler than I
Whack niggas move it aside
When you heard I was a big deal you were surprised
West coast bitch, put ya w's in the sky
I spent my days as a refugee till the rap game
Came to rescue me and left my wrist paved in accessories
A dangerous necessity I came here to wreck mcs
You're wrong if you thinking Wayne was the recipe
Nah, he ain't worthy of that, the controversy is back
Get off the kool aid stir me a batch
See I prefer to relax, but I can't and God knows it
Gotta stay raw with the flow that I'm diagnosed with
Oh shit, niggas keep fucking with my emotions
Maybe that's the reason that I suffer from psychosis
Shocking this high voltage, fuck it, my life's hopeless
So I had to make sure I killed it when I wrote this

Bounce like a trampoline, thousands are amped as me
Kids run up on your school campus and slap a dean
I grew on baggy jeans, pornographic nasty dreams
Moral of my damn story life isn't a happy scene
Wish I could stackin' cream, wish I had a Lamborghini
Wish I had the cover on a Rolling Stone magazine
I'm sick of the radio playing all these faggot teens
Keep it real, show me something ill that I haven't seen
For ten years I've been working on ill flows
And finally got a fucking record deal and I'm still broke
Man that's not common, bombs that I'm dropping are dope
But all that I can afford is some top ramen
I notice that you all niggas like to dumb the stats
I should stomp your ass out until your lungs collapse
No more corny cowabunga rap, we done with that, it's a rap
Keep it up and get your tongue detached, come on
Hop can probably make them bounce

I'm the last of a dying breed, hip hop max of variety
That's the reason I thrash on society
I get laughed at when I clash with a robbery
Until they feel the wrath when I smash on their dynasty
But I ain't Hollywood, I'm still the same kid
Upon the same shit, rapping in the basement
Catch me at your local school, skating bustin' tre flips
Left shoe lace ripped, you know how them days get
Listen while the bass hit, the only thing that changed is the way that girls act
'Cause now they think I'm amazing
I used to be the nigga chicks didn't wanna hang with
Sitting alone with a Capri Sun and raisins
My senior year in high-school I was always truant
Had a lot of homework but I would never do it, screw it
I'm the king now, homie take a bow
You need the crowd jumping I could probably make 'em bounce
Hop can probably make them bounce

Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You bet' not get it
I see myself as Bruce Banner
Some people say I'm a loose cannon
I only came here to do damage
Not 21, I'm just too savage
Go ahead and get you some new glasses
But I am unseeable, dude can it
I will applaud you if you manage
I now reside on a new planet
Nigga, my ego is on Eiffel
Piss a nigga off I ain't really gonna see no high road
""Damn Hop, why you seem so spiteful?""
Stepping on niggas like fee-fo-fi-fum
Get used to my trifle ways when enemies got a price to pay
I don't really fit in with none of you niggas
When I'm near you, I feel like a metal in a microwave
I'd much rather be at home all alone by myself
Fuck your support, I can buy it myself
Foes be the real reason why I melt
Y'all get around me and eyeing my wealth
I don't need anyone side my help
Pain in my eyes every time I yelp
If I don't relax then my mind might swell
But I guess that's life, oh well
So here's my hypothesis
The old me does not exist
Y'all like ""what Hop is this""
I'm not here for peace
I'm not here for love
Bitch, I want the opposite
So fuck all the compliments
Fuck being positive
I'm in my prime, but I ain't no Optimus
Shit's about to go down
I can promise it, biatch

How you tryna drive from the backseat
I been running things like an athlete
Pedal to the metal going max speed
Sippin' Red Bull 'cause I barely had sleep
Laboratory smellin' like a gas leak
Going up in flames when the track beat
I made a 100 motherfuckin' K last week
Niggas feeling me like Mr King's last speech
When you mixing a whole lot of hardcore revenge
And pitchfork your sins then misfortune wins
You can cop you a house up in Porter Ranch
And pull up on these hoes in Porsche or Benz
So many fake friends, I'm bored of friends
Life feel just like I'm bordered in
Have I talked to the Lord I sorta been
I been battlin' with life in a tournament
Let me split the facts
Bitch, relax, I lift the match and build the shit from scratch
First empire I built, shit collapsed
Had bad splits like my lips were chapped
Back in high school where not many kids could rap
When I engineer they ass just for cash
Niggas couldn't see where my head was at
In my living room where I rest the plaques
So here my conclusion
As I sit in this booth I condition to bruise
I'm vicious and gruesome
Your listening tools, some premeditated murder yes I meant to intrude
It's Panorama city, madness up against me
You see Prodigy the rapper TAC committee
I been rappin' 'fore the world tell me not to go sittin'
Like

Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You bet' not get it
Welcome to my Euphoria
This is a place where I'm too victorious
This ain't a place where the grass is greener
This is a place full of mad demeanor
Look sideways catch a bag of fever
Niggas stay shooked like they having seizures
My life's a movie and that's the teaser
So recognize the real nigga
You bet' not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (No doubt!)
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You bet' not get it twisted, nigga

74,What's My Purpose,2013,Knock Madness (2013),,Hopsin,"Planet Earth.
The place that I live... we live.
Who owns it?
You?
Nah... nobody owns this shit.
Just a big ass piece of rock with humans on it.
Do what the fuck I wanna do.
A lost human born into a dark society
With one mind state, there's no variety
Movin' vibrantly, tryin' to be the best that I can be
I've tried to see the light in livin' life but it just blinded me... irony
Now I'm thinkin' violently, because I feel my country went and lied to me
It's bringin' out a whole new fuckin' side to me, ride with me
If you feel my pain then you can cry with me
This fuckin' shady system is the rivalry
They the ones who raised us, turned us into cage nuts
They're what we're afraid of, they are why we ain't us
They the reason we constantly livin' for money and we just can't budge
It's takin' a toll on your dreams, so you gave up, and now the pain's stuck
They ain't showin' nothin' but fake love
We just numbers put on a pay stub
Our purpose shouldn't be to make bucks
We all slaves and if we never make a change then we straight fucked
I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human (I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bullshit around me, you fuckin' human
The problem is killin' my mind, God give me sign, maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'
Who set the standard for everybody to live by?
How far along in life would you be if you did try?
Who tryin' to help these ghetto neighborhoods where kids die?
This world has turned into a motherfuckin' pigsty
I look outside and it disgusts me, it bugs me
It's ugly, I trust no other fuckin' human but me
So what needs, to be done? Every day is a rerun
Technology's advanced, as people how far have we come?
Yeah, I can see that time's grown, but still I'm mind blown
'Cause everybody's mind is stuck inside they iPhone
They always textin' and postin' statuses hourly
But in reality there's no sign of a personality
It's cowardly, we shielded like we scared to get some allergies
The human being is what we don't know how to be
And honestly these issues really suck to know, but I refuse to sit and let the trouble grow
So God show me where the fuck to go
I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human (I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bullshit around me, you fuckin' human
The problem is killin' my mind, God give me sign, maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'
How can a man with power feel there's no responsibility?
These rappers blowin' up, but through my eyes they not as real to me
They constantly conceal the beast, but never tryin' to heal the streets
Teachin' girls to be a slut, but never make 'em feel unique
How can we feel fine this way? Open up your minds today
The matrix got you young, owin' a debt you'll spend your life to pay
Stressed out, assumin' that you'll be more happy inside your grave
Don't tell me about no fuckin' struggle, nigga, 'cause I know pain
To the point where I felt like life was shit
Growin' up as a kid with both parents who got no funds to ever provide you with
Shit is just stuck repeatin', the world is tough to be in
Munchin' on fast food, don't even know what the fuck I'm eatin'
America, I gave it my all
Still you guys arrested me for bein' black and standin' on a sidewalk
It doesn't matter if I'm breakin' laws or bein' harmless
I'm automatically hated by cops 'cause my dark skin
God was my smartest option
My soul is mine, ya'll ain't gonna bargain off it
'Cause if you do that means the darkness profits
The sky is where I got my heart adopted
Man, if we all just took the time to think I swear it won't be hard to stop this
But ya'll assume that I'm just startin' nonsense
But I promise ya'll the fuckin' world is gon' remember Marcus Hopsin
There's consequences for enlightenment, but if I have to hide the truth to live then I'mma die just like my idols did
I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human (I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bullshit around me, you fuckin' human
The problem is killin' my mind, God give me sign, maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'"

Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me
The world I live in was never a pleasant paradise
Bullies used to hassle me, then laugh 'cause I was scared to fight
I let the sun beam in on my skin, but I can't bare the light
So I reside on the side of life with nocturnal parasites
Treated unfair as an infant, abnormal characteristics
Waiting for terror to visit, as I stand there in the distance
Fucking arrogant bitches, you were never there with assistance
Wish I could fly into the air with the pigeons
Let it begin, the story how I never fit in
While the popular kids would run around with seventy friends
I'm just a heavenly sent, waiting for the day that I rise
So I could take my aggression and maybe place it aside
I gaze at the sky with contacts placed in my eyes
Asking why do they only love me when my face is disguised
I'm still waiting for signs but I doubt I'm a ever get them
If I never see any proof, how can I represent them man
I've been feeling down but nobody knows
Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me
I do this because I know it's what I'm destined to be
I do this for the kids who were always messed with and teased
I do this for the ones who were told they'll never succeed
I do this for those who grew up as young and restless as me
Y'all would always drink and go party with your crew in the nighttime
Doing shit nobody would ever do in their right mind
Then when you got a little older you hit a fine line
With an accidental kid struggling with a nine to five
You always thought that I was so stupid to write rhymes
Thinking I would never make it and lose with the white eyes
But the formula I created proved I was Einstein
Now I've done more shit then you'd ever do in a lifetime
Since elementary, you'd belittle me, show no sympathy
Hurt me mentally, but you never had the sense to see
That your desire to be cruel, was fire to my fuel
Would inspire me to rule, the world until I was cool
I've been feeling down but nobody knows
Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me
I ain't gonna take your shit, I've already lost my mind, lost my mind
You driving me crazy, so that it makes me cry, makes me cry
God if you exist then please send me a sign
Because all the rage that's stored in me is eating me alive
Help me out
I've been feeling down but nobody knows
Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me
Sometimes I wonder what the hell your problem is
Why must you love to see me this low
Won't you just let me live
Sometimes I wonder what the hell your problem is
Why must you love to see me this low
Won't you just let me live"

Michael Jackson crawling out of his grave with two kids
Bitches squirting [?] out of they two tits
Fuck a metaphor, basically nigga you ain't doing it
Hand you a mirror before I murk you, check out the view of this
I'm losing it, serial killer lurking the music biz
Without a mask, I want you bitches to know who the fuck it is
Suffering succotash, rims on a hovercraft
Romantic psychopath, I drown whores in a bubble bath
It's Mr. Benton nigga, y'all fall back
And lick the crease between my asshole and ballsack
I know how long you've waited (Waited for what?)
For the day all these games end
Knock-knock, who's there? H (H who?)
Knock-knock, who's there? O-P
Knock-knock, who's there? H (H who?)
Knock-knock, who's there? O-P
Locked and loaded
Ready to bring the ruckus
Thuggish ruggish
No other rapper can touch it
I'm disgusted, fuck it
Nah, I'm in a rush to put the pressure on
Let it be known, Ask yo girlfriend who she sextin' on
Better known, It's Mister Knock-Knock the panties down
You a hand-me down, Hammer down what they invested on
Shoulda' left it alone, Shouldn't have left her at home
It gets her off of you, I'm watchin' as she testin' it on
My marijuana scent all up in yo shit
You ain't shit, You as silent as my spit
I gotta couple rappers on my list
Better get established before I get to wrapping up careers
King Dizzy coming to give it to you straight
Taking place, Fuck being different
I care about being great
Nigga kill the hate
I'm coming just to kill it in yo state
Fuck the world, Fuck you
Run in place, I penetrate
We the shit
I know how long you've waited (Waited for what?)
For the day all these games end
Knock-knock, who's there? H (H who?)
Knock-knock, who's there? O-P
Knock-knock, who's there? H (H who?)
Knock-knock, who's there? O-P
Yeah, bitch I didn't wake up in a new Bugatti
Just in a room of rotten rappers, gruesome bodies I'm killin' like I'm illuminati
I'm fuckin' out the blue tsunami, nothin' you can do to stop me, I don't care if you knew karate or do pilates
You fools are probably (scared?) so gather you stupid posse and get me before I move to Aussy and they crucify me
Fuck your new Versace, you can get a cutthroat and deep-throat a dick till it's poking out through your butthole
Swallow the nut whole, this shit is X-rated
Y'all kept playin' on devilish ground till you met Satan
I stomp on you till you chest cave in and neck breaking
You better be keepin' you mouth shut like your breath stinkin'
There really isn't anyway I can be less blatant
So face it, you basically fuck, my brain is corrupt
This little bar - I'm raising it up
And you can watch me catapult after you finish licking Jarren's anus and nuts
It's Knock Madness!"
78,Witch Doctor,2017,No Shame (2017),,Hopsin,"Undercover Prodigy
Come on!
Look, I ain't gon' lie to you motherfuckers, I'm bad business
I ain't that industry nigga who always ass-kissin'
I got mad disses for anybody who askin' and
Y'all can sit and pout as you watch how high the cash gettin'
And bitch, I made hits, day to day in the basement
Slavin' away, playin' the game, makin' my name fizz
And lowkey I been checkin' to see how Dame is
And without Hop, I'm sorry nigga, you ain't shit
Do somethin', got you goose bumpin'
Who fuckin' with me? I'm rude, rugged and lovin' intrude ruckus
Too stubborn, I got the motherfuckin' juice chuggin'
You think you runnin' shit but you really my cute puppet
Just danglin' from a string, I was made to disrupt the peace
Don't care if you poppin', bitch, you basic as fuck to me
I've been labeled a fuckin' beast, it's a fatal corrupt disease
Don't be callin' tryna sit for a bagel and cup of tea, my nigga
Ooh, you don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Fuck around and break you off proper
You gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (sangoma)
You don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Savage!
I'm the dirty scoundrel, livin' life on the down-low
I've been to Hell, I sat with the man of the household
My heart froze, but you don't wanna know how cold
I feel like the one, but I ain't what you should count on
Buckle up, nigga! Have a blast, I'm an avalanche
Mashin' fans down on your master plan with a planned attack
It's like a massive pack of elephants, charge you with cataracts
So call an ambulance, I'm the straw that just broke the camel's back
You don't want problems, I'm serious, I am too sick (yeah, yeah)
I promise I ain't delirious, I can prove it (yeah, yeah)
Think twice, nigga, I'm eerie as Tyson's toothpick
Undercover Prodigy, visualize the movement, nigga
This is a brand new side of me that's emergin'
Evil and purgin', I am more deceivin' in person
Screamin' and cursin', fuck the world with penis insertions
I'ma feel this way until the day I'm leavin' this Earth, man
Ooh, you don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Fuck around and break you off proper
You gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (sangoma)
You don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!

Witch doctor, witch doctor
Soek jy 'n' sangoma? Soek jy 'n' sangoma? A sangoma?
Somebody better call the witch doctor (witch doctor)
Wi-wi-wi-witch doctor!
Listen, I ain't gon' pretend to be the best
I don't give a fuck about ever bein' politically correct
Look at the fans that all my misery has blessed
As long as I'm breathin' I ain't gon' give emcees a rest
Music can make a struggle seem cool - it's not
Do you know what the fuck I've been through? A lot
There is an evil me that speaks to me every evening
I tried to get rid of him but he rules my thoughts
Ooh, you don't want the backlash
Why you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!
Fuck around and break you off proper
You gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (sangoma)

79,You Are My Enemy,2010,RAW (2010),,Hopsin,"Yo, I work hard and barely get paid
How did I get stuck on this page
I've been starving for like six days
I should go and get a switch blade
And try to find out where this bitch stays
I'm a lit flame, what's your future I predict pain, slit veins, squished brains I'm just saying
Locked in the basement causes madness and errors
All I have to talk to is the fucking man in the mirror
But you never saw it from my perspective
The craft that I perfected got rejected
And thrown out the window with no proper exit
I was humble, now I'm not as pleasant
I'm dropping wreckage on your shady dynasty, bitch I'am not to mess with
You made me think it was impossible that I could blow and get a little money from selling records for copping clothes
Let's talk about the 42 records that Hopsin sold
You sleeping on a fucking pot of gold, so listen close
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy
Yo, since when are buddies posed to be so mean
They must be hating the air that we both breathe
Shit we used to be tighter than emo jeans
The day I boss, stand back and watched the c-notes gleam
I know you see me blowing up, growing up it disturbs you
When my words move fanatics, and in return you gotta post little blogs on the internet
Talking bout I've been erect, my career is wack I'll never benefit
I hope you die a bitter death
Then lie in a graveyard in regret
Where all of the foul niggas rest
You hating cause you witnessing the best
So just confess
You shattered our friendship and you can't fix the mess
I'm not a bit impressed by nothing you've done
My name's stuck on your tongue
Motherfucker you sprung
Give it up move on
You've taken this shit too far
You mad cause you unsatisfied with who you are bitch
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy
You were the love I used to see in my dreams
But when we met how come shit can never be what it seem
I was pleased with the things we did together, it's like we was a team
But you would change when I flee from the scene
Around me you were pure hearted, loving and caring
And when we hung out you'd even brighten up your appearance
You fooled me like you were smart, cute and something to stare
But you was fronting little bitch, now I'm struggling to bare it
Because you were the opposite of what you told me you don't do
Drugs, one night stands and you know that it's so true
You saw my heart exposed, grabbed a hold and then broke through
Hoes are just so rude, fucking bogus and cold to
Oh but there's no dude you would let interfere
With our love, that's the exact shit you said in my ear
When you arrived in my world, I thought heaven was near
But time made it very clear that the devil was here
So fuck you
Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy"
