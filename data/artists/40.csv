0,Acid Rain,2013,Acid Rap (2013),,Chance the Rapper,"Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses.
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back like ""that's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all this money, hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful, too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop, helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
High schools, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the white light
Rain, rain don't go away"

You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago shit and rocket ships

It's fried on the seat, come ride on the seat, ay
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic
You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up! Start dancing, ho

And we back, and we back, and we back, and we back, and we
And we back, and we back, na, na, na
This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh, igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
You know what I mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the words
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third
This is all we got
Isn't this all we got?
So we might as well give it all we got
This is all we got
Music all we got, got, got
So we might as well give it all we got
I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give Satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothing away
'Cause at the end of the day
Music all we got
Music all we got
Isn't this all we got?
So we might as well give it all we got
Music all we got

3,Angels,2016,Coloring Book (2016),,Chance the Rapper,"Angels, na, na, na, na
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't going to hell or the Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
So they fuck around, sign me to OVO
Ooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even have Steve giving out apples for free
They was talking ""woo woo this woo wap da bam""
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded
Who is you? And who the fuck is you? And who is him?
All of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me
Na, na, na, na I got angels
I got angels
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, nigga's never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gonna make me take the campers way downtown
You gonna make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live

4,Blessings,2016,Coloring Book (2016),,Chance the Rapper,"I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up
(Good God)
The blessings come down
Good God
When the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Good God)
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!
There are obstacles in life
Many many trials and tribulations that come up
But you got to realize and know
That even Jericho walls must fall
Every wall must fall
Fall Jericho, fall
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
(Good God)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him till I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
(Good God)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
(Are you ready, are you ready?)
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap"
5,Blessings (Reprise),2016,Coloring Book (2016),,Chance the Rapper,"I speak of promise land
Soil as soft as momma's hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with Shawty and they ship it like the odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must've missed the come up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes
I made it through, made it through, made it through
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming, coming, coming
So are you ready?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?

Mother, shut your mouth
Still a chain smoking, name dropping
Good looking, motherfucking
Mother, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping, mother shut your mouth
Somebody pray for the god, oh Lord, I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit, rappin', trappin', trippin' 'cid and sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died yelling, ""YOLO was a lie and you a liar, wonder why you wanna die so young""
You and I look just alike and I'm afraid that this one right here might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang but I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain't tryna go out at all got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last chance joint gotta be a dance joint from an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint, old school for my own old man joint
Still a chain smoking, name dropping
Good looking, motherfucking
Mother, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping, mother shut your mouth
This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit, igh
Why toss my filter when she saved my life?
The same shit that kills us, always taste so right
That's why I pray to the dealer, God know who he be
Truth be told he juiced me, introduced me to the lucy leaf
Oh oh oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire, flyer on the wall I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night, in the sky I get higher, higher
Still a chain smoking, name dropping
Good looking, motherfucking
Mother, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening

I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Okie dokie, alky. Keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just mght be outtie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling ""Fuck me""
Two weeks she'll be yelling ""fuck me""
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM)
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking hows it going
Say the goings well
Go figure, Victor's light skinned, Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell
All praise to the God, God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, check mate, check me, take me to the bedroom, let you know me well
I mean normally, you see, Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days they get so high, burn trees, smoke Chlorophyll
Till they can't feel shit, shit faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing, got me feeling like Lauryn Hill
Miseducated, my dick delegated, rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz, asshole, absinthe up in that class
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong, we're brain dead, take a tug and then pass
I think we all addicted, yeah
I think we all addicted, really though
I think we all addicted
I think we addicted
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter
Two seats used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing out by trucks in a Uzi
That's the new principle, sometimes I'm a be about some ho
Sometimes I'm a wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish, I could still break your body
Down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what a miss is
I'm a end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

9,Everybody's Something,2013,Acid Rap (2013),,Chance the Rapper,"What's good good?
And what's good evil?
And what's good gangstas?
And what's good people?
And why God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia tallied up ten of em
I slurped too many painkills, downing em off a lot
I got a lot off days but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya'know what I mean?
I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back cause the cops shot you
Buck buck bang bang, yelling ""Fuck Fox News""
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck ops too
Ain't no knuckling up em young 'cause it just not cool
Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demons ass
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
Right? IGH
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but my hard head
Stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe
Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demons ass
Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas
Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us, we tryna get lucky
Doper than Nucky
You're ending happy that's only a tuggy
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot
But y'all still love me ugh
How father time a deadbeat
Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless
Everybody's somebody's everything
Nigga
Nobody's nothing
Nigga
Everybody's somebody's everything
Nigga
Nobody's nothing at all
Wu-Tang
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
I know you right"

(Oh, alright, I just wanted to say thank you for everything
For the computer, the T-shirts, and all the other stuff)
You know, Chance, let me tell you something
You know, I could never be more proud of anything in my life, you know, than I am of you and what you've done
Chance, you have done remarkable and wondrous things, so you don't have to tell me thank you for anything
I'm supposed to do this, that stuff for you anyway, and ya know, just keep doing what you're doing
I am very, very proud of you
Just keep doing what you're doing, okay?

'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla
Everything's good
Rubbin' on yo chin sippin gin, Margiela brand chinchilla
Everything's good
My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos
And some fruit snacks and some killer
Phone numbers on speed dial, call them save monkey guerillas
Everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodbyes, I ain't really that bad at leaving
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin' through purses even persons leave 'em hurtin', bleedin'
I ain't really help the helpless, I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses, I'm good like books in churches
Harolds and Hooks and Church's, everything's good
See my name when you Google search it, use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's good
But I knew it was fly when I was just a caterpillar
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at good night, I ain't really that bad at sleepin'
With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings birthdays even Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, weekends
Rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events
Damn, it feel good to be a gangsta and it feel good for me to thank ya
Put money back in your bank account
Off of songs I barely could think up 'cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound
I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo
Thanks Justin, lending them pencils
Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto, the time I beat Chris on Nintendo
Nanana hey hey, good intro
Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller
Remember the first time you heard this dude and thought, ""Damn that's that nigga""

11,Favorite Song,2013,Acid Rap (2013),,Chance the Rapper,"Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Dang, dang, dang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Then take that bomb for Heat, three-peat
Chance, ho, I said, cruising on that LSD
Ask yourself about my deal
You'll go batshit - ""hell yeah, let's eat""
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies 'bout that bag
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam
Young Rascal Flatts, young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack
Enforce the weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair wrap, weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?
Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words

Niggas please be focused - that 'Bino, you know this

You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your 'hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'm a be that - CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said: ""this my favorite song""
""Hold my purse"" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car 'cause it's got cursing in it
Your boy like: ""I'm the one who showed you, "" he want his percentage
'Cause you were like: ""this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?""
Two-step, white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing? 'Cause you Harlem Shake?
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies 'bout that bag

They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter I was acting a fool
But who would think the raps would turn into racks?
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you
Scars on my head, I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body can't rely on myself
Last year got addicted to xans
Started forgetting my name and started missing my chance
LA for four months end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city bitch I sleep in my hat
I felt hog tied ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride

Gimme the water, gimme the water
I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray I got to pray, like Hammer after ""2 Legit""
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrap the stupid shit
I ""Stand Up"" like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much you'd think they drive an Uber whip
Damn, queen said why we in a queen bed
I said it's yours don't worry little bean head
I'm just here to catch my breath, I got a world tattoo

Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers
So when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child
I know my God
I know my God seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown

This thirst in my soul
There's a thirst in my soul and tell me
Where I stand I go
Where
For you
Come on
I may cry a river
I may cry a thousand tears
But you take each drop and you wash
You wash me new
Me new
People sing
This water is deep
Yes
This water is
Yes and I need you to
Jesus rescue me
Come on, I need you to
Take me to your mountain

So someday Chicago will be free
Someday we'll all be free

13,Good Ass Intro,2013,Acid Rap (2013),,Chance the Rapper,"Even better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh (Yo we back)
I'm good, ooohh yeah, I'm good
Even better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh
(I'm good, so good)
(And we back and we back and we back and we back)
(And we back and we back and we back and we back)
Even better than I was the last time
Rap's just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'mma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds zan, gallon lean
Make a joke bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job and I'm good
Better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh
(I'm good) I'm good, so good
Better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm good, so good
Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn't be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancellor The Rapper, please say, ""The Rapper""
Magical word, poof, please say, ""Kadabra""
Replay the replays, Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk till dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done, I'm good, igh
Better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm good, so good
Better than I was the last time baby, ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm good (I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be), so good
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job and I'm good"
14,How Great,2016,Coloring Book (2016),,Chance the Rapper,"How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see how great is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see, how great, how great, is our God
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing how great is our God
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing how great is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see how great is our God
How great, is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see, how great, how great, how great, how great, how great, how great, is our God
The first, is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit it Spotify to qualify a spot on his side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis
The book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
Till one score in three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrified the enemy like Hedwig till he petrefied
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide
79th, 79th, I don't believe in science
I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I see dollar signs
Color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosena Santa invoked and woke up slaves from south Hampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's is behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Here, for I will speak noble things as they trusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, Exalt, glorify
Descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies
I used to hide from God
Ducked down in the slums like ""shhh""
I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back
Or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark, gently, gently, I rowed my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
But she was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height, wage won
The poltergeist to exalt the Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal of tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
'O son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with the foot on water and the foot on land
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber and put the true name of the Lord in it
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire
Poison the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs
It was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground"
15,Interlude (That's Love),2013,Acid Rap (2013),,Chance the Rapper,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is balling it up
What's better than followers is actually falling in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wandering following love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing your Xan
Is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollering love
What's better than rhymes, nickles, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for calling her up
There ain't nothing better than falling in love
I've seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on top of the head
I know you seen it all before
But when it looks you in the eyes
It ain't nothing you could say, but that's love
That's love
That's love
That's love
Say that's love
That's love
That's love, that's love, that's love
I love you, I love you

Swallow my mucus, hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (Bang)
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of illusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing till my voice get raspy, last week suspended
Last night kissed Va$htie, parleyed with Ashley
Always in the hallway, so I never been classy, shut up
Na na na, na na na

Acid acid, get it? Acid
Melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper
If this was work, I'd get hired
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with jack
Lickety-split, lickety-slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana split backs, give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fuck is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra, I eat it like Idi Amin, you know what I mean
Hit me back when that mean shit

Three Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh, I rep the East Coast

I splash summer like a fast brother
With a number on his back, ain't no fumblin', in fact, I'm
Back, acid in my hat, shoot then pass the gat
It's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag
My new shorty got a gymnastic bag
87 that move green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef's salad
She had the club foot with that little arm
I couldn't help but laugh, she ordered chicken parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on

Than it is to find a fucking parking spot

This this shit I've been warned about
I hope that it storm in the morning
I hope that it's pouring out
I hate crowded beaches
I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dying first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring
