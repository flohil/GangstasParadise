0,But Can You Kill the Nigger in You?,1996,Autobiography Of Mistachuck (1996),Hip Hop,Chuck D,"(Feat. Isaac Hayes)
When I was a lad
We had indentured bond servants
Stout conishman and Scotsman
{Indeed sir endeed
And if one of them runs away you couldn't tell 'em from any other Englishman
But take our black slave sir
And no matter how far they run they always black}
Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1, 2
But can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you
Quiet as it's kept
Some of y'all slept on yourself
Next time you hit the mirror black
Turn you back on yourself
I wouldn't trust some a y'all
If you was my right hand, man
I'd cut it off at the wrist
Like you name was Benedict
Enough lead
To threaten 50 niggas dead, you said
Cause niggas is back to perms and relaxers
All up in their head
TV niggas only make you laugh, embarrass
Can you catch it
Nigga fever new season
Of modern day Stephen Fetchits 1990's
Niggas be fraid of the noise I made
Bout their master crackers giving out
Disasters in the hood
Phony honeys be gone when they moneys be gone
Niggaresses artificial chests'
Posin fake hair and high dresses
Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1, 2
But can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you
Madd niggas hittin shit
But they health be quittin it
Clothes and car makin' the men
Havin' counterfeitin fit
Seizing niggas be praisin
Benzes Beemers when they got em
Shined and simonized foreclosed
Bit they grills be rotten
Simon sez niggas jump
And they jump for these Hilfiggers
Tommy hates niggas high priced styles
White as wild rice
Niggas be dwellin in hell and the
Negros pray for heaven
Fuck the preacher he don't reach
You my nigga roll a seven
Niggas forgettin trips about those
Slavery ships
Niggas wasn't there they claim
Fuck that nigga bring the pain
Niggas be dealin' Narcotic
But don't get the money nigga
Women or the fame my nigga
Or the mother fuckin' game
Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1, 2
But can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you
Check it
Brother Isac drop it on the groove one time
Let the beats check-check out your mind
Brother Isac Hayes
Yo-yo brothers I say to you
Become literate, study your history
Then you know where you need to go
Don't get socialy anestezied, thinkin' you got the rock
When you got the pable
Learn who you are
Come together and survive
It's time to learn to love again
It's time to stand out and be near
Think about your history
And free it from your misery
Learn... to love again
(Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1, 2)
It's time to learn to love again
(Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true)
It's time to learn to love again
(Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1, 2)
It's time to learn to love again
(Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics is true)
Learn! To love again"

Feedback back for your bad ass, yeah
As you witness I'm surrounded by 2 more emcees
Outta my war council
My rottweiler or rhymes
B-wyze a/k/a Blast
Introducing my Doberman
Of destruction
Lyrical destroyer
Dow Jonz a/k/a John Connor Of Moruturi
My war council comin' smashin
Through battle zones of microphones
Whatever goes [repeated]
(Verse 1: Dow Jonz)
Yo, my man, the rhymes I write, they be the illest
And I be fucking up careers like those of Arnold, Kimberly and Willis
You'll take the penicillin, run DMC and Jay
Say I ""be illin""
My crew ain't juicy, I am not cold chillin'.'
I'm a super villain.
I'd even room with Dr. Doom
And we'd be killin'! I'd rip a bitch in London just for one shilling.
I'm on your cable, channel X I'm causing strife
But it make me wanna holler, son, the way they do my life.
Check it!
Executives in suites eat dinner and discuss
How I can make more for us, whenever I bust
I step forth from the jungle in fatigues.
The everglades, canteen full of liquor.
I'm sitting on grenades
Little women squirming from the 12th down to 11th grades
When they see me in the magazine
Upon they wall they stick the page
But you're too young I'll take you mom
And shacked from shells and bombs
Uncle Sam make brothers Uncle Toms in Vietnam
Battle two (So what you gona do ?)
Skilla-skills demandin' endonesia

(Verse 2: B-Wyze)
Yo, it's ""A Low Down Dirty Shame""
How I'm ""Surviving The Game""
To get the ""Glory""
Son this ain't no ""West Side Story""
""Who's The Man"" that started with the
""Boyz In Da Hood""
And the 5 ""Heartbeats"" he would
""Shuffle Hollywood""
Could it be the ""King Of New York""
Up in the lights form them days in
""Crooklyn""
To them ""Harlem Nights""
In this ""New Jack City""
I'm the man with the ""Juice""
Meet me ""Uptown Saturday Night""
""Bustin' Loose""
""The Mack""
The ""Black Caesar""
And if ""She's Gotta Have It""
I'm a ""Do The Right Thing"" and please
Her
Her man got a death wish
'Cause he wanna fight
But I hold a ""Lethal Weapon""
On ""Judgement Night""
You bring it on
MC's ain't ready for the battle
My ""Posse"" will leave you
""Sleepless In Seattle""
""48 Hours"" of nuttin but ""Tales From The Hood""
Gimmie ""Dead Presidents Fella"" 'cause I'm

And ah... I wanna hear Dow Jones
Ey yo Chuck, Chuck
How you doin' man?
You got your back off, and B-wyze
So he straight shit doin' man
C'mon c'mon
(Verse 3: Dow Jonz)
God damn, like the 85'ers eat the ham
I'll eat up weak MC's and that means shorty and his man
My name is Dow from the clique about to die
Others call me John Conner and perhaps
I'll tell the reason why
While Hiroshima blackens up the sky
I will lounge inside my shelter as you fry
As you're incinerated
I'll come around again forget me not
I had to shine with darkness for a minute
That was hot
(Verse 4: Chuck D)
Semen in a women
From the men without hats
Get your life split up like some Kit Kats
I seem to be triple teamed
By gang green
Who don't listen
Bluntz them must be hittin
(Can't read) emission
I stress the position
At the top of the slop
Crackas be droppin' a lot
Like saltines out the box
I despise singin' songs in the low rider duckin cynics
Fuck 'em and those Johnny come critics

2,Free Big Willie,1996,Autobiography Of Mistachuck (1996),Hip Hop,Chuck D,"No mistako
Not just some whacko from Waco
Crazy I'll plead insanity
Just to save humanity
Be good like no Johnny
Never liked no Guliani
'Cause they never could stop me
Not their imaginary Rocky
Get me then acquit me attack me
What a shock to Pataki
Here here watch a brother duck the chair
I fear only the one
Upstairs who got no pears
I'm not part of the click
It's whatcha see is whatcha get
My realitites personal
Many times rhymes forget
Some ain't heavy like others
But they still be my brothers
And disgusted at the other folk laughin' at us
Wit the ashes to the ashes the bluntz to the bluntz
A chip off the whole block
I shock and get the word in
Maybe that's why a brother like me shoulders the burden
I smells between the white sheets
A hell of a beast
In the back lurkin
Don't front step to the circle
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Number one cause the Big Willie (yeah)
Cause for some' us it's a dream
But to the rest it's a nightmare
Spending more time in the air than
A flight attendant
The rhyme got winded on the way up
On what I thought was a lay up
These two cent criticizers can't size
We don't realize we all under a microscope
Of a nation of other folk
So all this nigga callin is we fallin'
Attitude have we forgotten
Entertaining is today's way of picken cotton
So that the younger gees and bees
Think all we can bees is a big dreamer
In order to get a Benz or a beemer
Some stuck in that 96 Lexus per minute shit
It's that same ol' story that bores me
Ignores me
My metaphors be over
That head of even heads
To some I'm prophetic
To the rest I'm pathetic
I led a movement of mentals
Against the feds and point spread
On beats madd noize and funky instrumentals
There once was a time
We fought the power with a rhyme
Now the attitude goin' round
No use tryin'
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Number one cause the Big Willie (yeah)
Cause for some' us it's a dream
But to the rest it's a nightmare
...Aha... c'mon... right
Ride on, ride on yeah
We don't need to be no Big Willie
Last verse check it out...
Got more hits than Pete Rose
Had for the Reds
Now they be on anything Deion intercepts
Except I'm in a zone now getin wreck
I get around
Can I get down like Craig Mack
How can I get down
Back like rock 'em sock 'em robots who forgot it was him
Who parlayed
The styles of KRS and Rakim
And brought it to a different level
Against the so called devil
Who had the nerve to throw a bell curve
And test me, arrest me
Lemme go let I grow no
I've been through the afro
It's been a long time so my childhoods
Retro
Unlike today
As we be watchin us pay
The price that bugs me know'n that God
Don't like ugly
Got a free pair of lugz
To run quicker from the slugz
But slipped from the madd dirt
That was swept under the rug
A lil' down, but not out
Not what you thought it was
It's just peace no beefs, I getz love
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Number one cause the Big Willie (yeah)
Cause for some' us it's a dream
But to the rest it's a nightmare
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Mad at the man no doubt
Althogh you feelin' all right
It's feelin' somebody been have left out
Number one cause the Big Willie (yeah)
Cause for some' us it's a dream
But to the rest it's a nightmare"

I change the people around me
Some don't know was'up
Shit iz jus fucked up
They don't know what's next
Generation Wrekked
See I'm hangin' in like Sam Sever
To all you Johnny come latelys
Who didn't recognize how great and
Clever some of those rhymes be
Think quick
Been flowin over domes
Mad vocab to silly crabs
Before Metaphors be passin
Your ass like taxi cabs
Hit my toll free number
To hear bombs I dropped
1 800 7654321
You don't stop
I need my noize like Patrick and Barkley need rings
Like Griffey gets swings
1st time rhymes played me off like Sacramento Kings
3-6 for the 9-6 1 move my rhymers with the times
Wit no crimes or pantomime
No great pretender spenders
20 years got mad tears leavin' tears in they beers
From the rear old school getting theirs
You getting scared
It is on and on and 3 steps ahead
Hot topics shock in the house
Fulla heads
Getting burned while you learn on a hospital bed
Madd kids never checkin' for what I said
Jack be quick
Jack be nimble on the brain
I'm stay'n simple
But the sound remains insane
Same mad pain no gain getting getto on the table
No stories no fables relax I'm cinemax to the blacks
No cable
Round and round here I go
Putting this sound down
But some a y'all got fears and scared to get
Down

I change the people around me

Some don't know was'up
Shit iz jus fucked up
They don't know what's next
Generation Wreckked
Now I'm the one who flew over the Cuckoo's nest and tested
And wasn't ever bullet proof vested
Resurrection of the one man vocal section
Spirit in your dark ass direction
For your mind body and soul protection
Reality checks keep it real
Bring in real checks
On and off the road been through
1100 sondchecks
Those influenced under the influence
Getting mad hits from truants
Dazed and confused hangin' wit crews
Who livin' blues
A million doomed consumers
Who say they know they black
Threw they medallions back
In exchange for 40 dozen six packs
Born under a terrible sign in 1969 comin'
Blind
Livin' inside hard ass times
Getting kicks offa wack karate flicks
He kills but gots no fightin skillz
It's getting ill so many funerals
Stylin now its gold plated medallions
I didn't know under fros
We got so many black Italians
If I can't change the people around me
I change the people around me
Some don't know was'up
Shit iz jus fucked up

Brothers and sisters, they slow gas

This beast prepared a horizontal feast
No least then a 666 corntale trips
This devil loves it man, but check this
His enemy is going public
He going public about this vertical snowflakes
Bakes at 33 and a third degrese
On her knees she begs please (please please)
Just give me just one more hit
Just give me just one more hit
Just give me just one more hit
Ease my pain
Brain on a wide so train
Set a one way trip
To the ???? trippin' America
Brought to you by the ultimate sin
Horizontal pozes, cloth and backsin
Horizontal heroin (watch it)
Peace this is Griff...
And we bring it full circle
Black to the dome

Line 'em to you
Yo Bob

Aaight
To you
This about report to the commissioner
To you
This about that time
Set it off...
To all the critics that had me counted out
To all the cynics I fought and Thought they had me figured out
Who opened doors on 32 tours
From last year's GIVE IT UP goin' back to YOU
'Re gonna get yours
38 countries in the name of hip hop
Never stopped, 7 Continents
Attackin governments
Political rhyme practice
I gave cause you lack this
Serious sense of time and world geographics
Bring ya brain outside philly
East to the West, North to the South
If you're black we can't all be Big Willie (never)
And to be judged by a hit
By some counterfeit click
That's some bell curve shit
'Cause I'm cool like this
Now how I get my swerve on I keep hittin nerve bombs
Relax the saluting arms carry on and carry on
My record speaks for itself I never stopped the hip hop
And I never jumped backwards or kissed myself
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one (yeah... I'm tellin' you)
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one (I'm tellin' you)
If you don't know me you can call me
(C'mon)
Can't win without beginning it
Heed the word of the brother and the voice that got muscles in it
Now I'm'ma show you a waste is a terrible thing to mind
Rhymes without education equals butter from the gutter
And all this talk about the street we stay in and playin'
Is a fishtank by the hated you thank
And you say ho hum another story to bore me
Maria take a letter tell Mayor have a freeknik in Marietta
Here comes the halfstepper hypocrites and advocates
Who care
But be crashin like US Air
The last Bohemian but you'll never see me intoxicated
By bones in drug zones I hate it
One on one black CNN
Keep it from bein in the cartoon network
The rhymes can hurt and do work
Got you lookin' for the loot
Is down down to the one and shoot
50 fought to the cracker so for all y'all I getz blacker
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck
Public Enemy number one
You don't know me you can call me Mistachuck
If you don't know me you can call me mister
I don't care for Range Rovers
Cause the price is too high
And I feel 'em gettin' over
Land Cruisers, Issuzus or new shoes
Man dem notes is heavy
That's why I got a couple Chevies
Low budget I am believe me when I speak it
Limousine ain't a damn thing unless they let me keep it
I duck the cakewalk and all dat BS talk
About what's fatter West coast, North, South or New York
It don't matter
It don't matter
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one (yeah..)
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one

6,Niggativity...Do I Dare Disturb the Universe?,1996,Autobiography Of Mistachuck (1996),Hip Hop,Chuck D,"No buddah bliss
She musta missed it
Still bangin' wit the anger
Kissed a soul sanger
Class of 78 sunset strip
'Cause I been outta high 20 years with 30 somethinish peers
What a trip
Never drank beer with the boyz
But the love we shared was for the art of noise
Dump puff a smoke make me cough
But I'm not a chimney
So you can't call that shit soft
What turned me off
Swore their breath stunk
Plus/I never got out rhymed by a drunk
Now a style is your hair or something you wear
Who said it's getting zooted
Till your brains polluted
I ain't playin'
This mainstain stayin rooted
Instead of be'in pimped and then prostituted
Won't be the last time
Cause it ain't the first
So do I dare disturb the universe?
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
[Method Man:] Goin' down, diggy diggy down
No you turn
I pumped up, hittin switchez
But all this talk reflect niggas and bitchez
Where did that come from
Only the labels can explain
But they play dumb while they take from
I hit 'em up the rhyme uppercut
Tell me what have they done for me lately but hate me
Attack me might as well be damn Pataki
This hip hops in me
So they can't stop me
The rhyme animal has resurfaced
Wreckin all elements destroyin all irrelevant
It all comes down to this
What good is talking 'bout the hood
When you got mutherfucken madness
Am I ringin' those senses
Brothers drinkin' worse shit
Then they're be pourin in their benzes
I give a damn so I curse
So do I dare disturb the universe
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
Gettin' you down like gravity
[Method Man:] (Goin' down, diggy diggy down)
See I always been a rebel
Now I got my own kind blind
Brain trained on the devil level
You don't measure a man by what he got
It's what he does, what he left and what he takin' care of
A brother like me annoys em
But I'm +Kool G+
When I +Rap+ about 'em it's +Poison+
Everybody wanna be Big Willie
Chasin down loot Dole and Newt
Who do you shoot?
I'm fingerin targets
While ya figurin
Figgaro Figgaro
Soup opera for the niggaro
I ain't chasin no movies like Jason
Or Loolapalooza 'cause I ain't no looser
Ruff stuff to the babies spread like ravens
To the heads of heads but I ain't crazy
Chorus to the chorus verse to verse
But do I dare to disturb the universe?

I caught you peekin around the corner
Tryin' to see if we left yet
We staked out your shit last night
Feeling the vibe for death
To make you strangle on you blood fluid.
You know it
Sleep walking with the machete saying
Them dogs made you do it, true it
Mr. Machete telling you bitches I'm ready
Never nervous behind the barrel
Trigger finger stay steady
So buckle up
It's the only way to survive the ride
Down to the Y we havin' a party inside
I dedicated this to all you insects
Who deep on buggin me
Pushing my panic button, needin trauma
Unit recovery
My tracks be fat got them attracting like crack
Even P.E. be screaming you bring that beat back
Come one come all my shit be smoking like echo sauna
The underground went with digital
Humpin around if you wanna go
Toe to toe or pussy to dick
Head chicken heads practice on carrot
Sticks
Or let you doo doo hole spread eww
Y'all niggers chill 'cause we went there too
We change this shit from the ruffside
To the shithole crew
And we're paid
[B.I.G.:] (Goodness gracious)
Gettin' money
[B.I.G.:] (Tha papers)
Gettin' money
[B.I.G.:] (Get paid)
(Verse 2: Melquan)
Spinach flips my lips
Sit on top of crystal bottle tips
Sippin ready to flip do a hit
On a rapper that a serpent
Counterfeit criminal fakin jacks
Luxury in his raps ain't facts
If a camouflage large niggas
Keep it on the low black
No raps or Kodak just stacking cheese
Freezers packed
Murdered human bodies executed vicious
Reputed business German lugers
Lift spitting and twist just
Flesh confronted nobody want it son
I come correct
Connect vocabulary that burry your rep, yep
Son slaughter rip shit
On tracks that I eclipse with
Flowin showing I'm wicked
Lyrics murderin myths with
No remorse a different flow continuous
Blends with no resemblance
Money and power till it's vengeance
[B.I.G.:] (Goodness gracious)
Gettin' money
[B.I.G.:] (Tha papers)
Gettin' money
[B.I.G.:] (Get paid)
(Verse 3: Chuck D)
One of the seven they couldn't hang
Stepped to the six
The last brother alive
Of the startin five-one of the ones
But you look don't acknowledge
The mix with a quickness
Suckers fall and crumble
To the sickness (sickness)
Of not baggin themselves
Not braggin helps
Your lil ass go figure
Why ya pants be saggin
Stare at my audacity
I ain't from the city (strong ile)
No pitty no tears
'Cause I ain't from around here
Freestyle what's the use
Record companies get the money
And give you juice, and end up cutting your ass loose (cut off)
While you style for free
They talk wild for a fee
And getcha ass souped
While you never ever recoup
Catchin wreck wit no check
They'll never give ya respect
Ya blackself (my brother)
Getcha self some real yelp (yeah)
Accountant, sharp businessman
Who'll sit down and show ya
Instead a some rich bitch lawyer
Who swear that he know ya-he don't
Know ya as long as
Other folk in rap
Got it made
Fuck freestyle
I wanna stay paid (paid)
[B.I.G.:] (Goodness gracious)
Gettin' money
[B.I.G.:] (Tha papers)
Gettin' money
[B.I.G.:] (Get paid)"
9,Talk Show Created the Fool,1996,Autobiography Of Mistachuck (1996),Hip Hop,Chuck D,"(On my next show:
Gay pet's)
(Laziness is in the house
Slob wit no job is in the house)
(Verse 1: Chuck D)
See my rhymes be hot like soul food spots
I don't give a damn Jenny Jones
A 100 million homes
Grown folks doin' anything
To be some known folks
Go tell Montell he gotta sue to
Get like Donahue
Between soap operas and bras
Commercials sop opraah
Gossip by their own admissions
Failed smoke emissions
So enquired minds wanna know
How low can we go
On a TV show Hoochie and the Blow
Reverses the race
Cursed the nation the doom generation
The next voice you hear
Says get the fuck up outta here
From pyramids, to hearin what he, she or they did
Ain't no bizness on the screen
If you know what I mean
(Lazyness is in the house
Slob with no jobs is in the house)
He say she say they all got beef
Dragin their business all over in the street
Bad things is some of them think its cool
Talkshow created the fool
(Verse 2: Abnormal)
They tryin' to portray themselves like
Their movie stars, big Willie style
Francin a mansion and fancy cars
But in real life they live in projects
And trailer parks all the bullshit they talk
Makes me wanna spark L's
Looking at channel zero from hell
They frontin like they saying something
But they ain't sayin' nothin'
Players and hustlers, hookers and druggy's and racist
I'm tryin' to face this
The poison that they feed in this my mind
I'd rather be watchin BET Rap City
On my big screen TV believe me
When I say it
They do it for the greed of the fame
Following the trends of the Hollywood game
It a shame
Sellin their souls for 50 beans
Looking like fools on the tube
Just to get the damn cream
Dragin their business all over in the street
(Verse 3: C.Brewser)
Talk show host really TV evangelist
Bringin' the most scandalous folks
With lies they can't handle it
Mad Drama trauma coming at you out to harm ya
Infect your mental with an infectious type of insomnia
Lies in disguise about women who really guys
And guys who really women like that's such a big surprise
You lies it's just like this whole world enterprize
Best understand black man is infinite potential wise
Realize TV amazing confusion type illusion
Brought to your brain cell
Giving you mental type dillusions
It's all brain wall syndrome
Sending you in a cyclone
Plus had for your health so best leave it alone
Bad things is some of them think its cool
Talkshow created the fool
(Verse 4: Chuck D)
I be crawlin in that head like a virus
You say lemme try this
Way back when medicine
Scaring some of our children
Soul brother number one
Is back in black in you kitchen
Tell granma to chill on those chitlins
Make no mistake Ricki Lakes eatin mad steaks
Off your bad breaks
Funerals and wakes
Some of that shit is fake Yeah!
She said He said
Baby/Mama stick it
All for TV time
Hotels and airplane tickets
Embarrass our asses and degrade
End of the day ain't that a bitch
Geraldo's getting paid
(Laziness is in the house
Slob wit no job is in the house)
He say she say
They got beef
Draggin their bizness all in the streets
Bad things is some of them think its cool
Talk show created the fool

10,The Pride,1996,Autobiography Of Mistachuck (1996),Hip Hop,Chuck D,"Yeah, reminiscent of another time
And another state of mind
I used to flow
They used to call me a rhyme animal
Some of them don't call me rio mo so
I try a new style refuse to get wild
On the B side because I still got my pride
The pride comes from another time
My father and mother plus God
Blessed the rhyme
Born in 1960 seventy suckers quizzing
Me what was it like before everybody
Tried to be like Mike
Back in the day when our peeps had to fight for our rights
To make the day fell aaight
But there is no is without a was
No about to be buts or because... I got the
Pride
Reminiscent of another time
Dashikis, bells, to straight legs
Platforms and picks
See it wasn't just about the fro
It was what was underneath that fro
Black power for the powerless
Deuce and quarters, caddies 442's
Yeah pride
Say, say it loud
James singin' black and I'm proud
I was in third grad when Dr. King got slain
And if I had to read a book about
The facts, the fact is that the black
Would be overlooked look
1967 I was seven livin' proof of
What I had learned in my youth
What a difference a score and a
Decade makes mistakes and super bad
Breaks wait
I ate the food in the lunch programs
And now I see the young strung out on
Grams so I work on a go on
And so on and soon communicate to
Get the young straight
'Cause I got the pride
Flamboyant names
Free Huey, Eldridge, Bobby, Angela
Woodstock to Kent State
Music of the time for the mind
45?s, Aretha, Four Tops
Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes
Assassinations Presidents
Sixties Soul
Now in order for us to know
Who we are we got to know
Who we was and once we know
Who we was then we know who
Were gonna be
Pride
The panther party before lad-i-da-di
Put pride inside plus taught karate
Fed heads in many ways many days
Were served locked down protectin the
Black and the brown
Now today the old must spread it
I said it
If they don't communicate then the
You can't get it
Problems have to be solved they
Won't go away so man what
You say and don't sway
Gotta get that pride
King, Malcolm, Medgar, Hampton
Ritos and rebellions
Newark, Watts, Uptown
Harlem that is black gold
Ghetto stell
I reserve the right to be nothing
But a man
We reserve the right to be nothing
But men and women"
11,Underdog,1996,Autobiography Of Mistachuck (1996),Hip Hop,Chuck D,"Little is known why I beckon and moan
I see what's comin'
Madd brothers will be bumming
After the math the drug lords brought the wrath
Of those of us who once thought we needed to be weeded
Bust, dust made that head bust
I remember came after
Cheba cheba had you wide like a receiver
What looks like fire is ice
Fall for the flame
Catch it twice like Jerry Rice
Nice!
Against odds I recognize it in the cards
Hard to be played back and black the jack of all spades
Ash to ashes blunts to blunts
Some of these geez ain't real
I seen 'em once upon a time
So many rhymers and not enuff rhymes
I hope they around next year but I fear
I'm all time and I'm down for the ruffness
But what good is the rhyme without substance
Now back to the underdog
Now whooooo
East to the...
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Now whooooo
East to the...
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
Nobody savin' the time
The rhyme never thanks
Who be givin'
Ravin who on top of the charts
Grabbin the Gavin
Now I can't use my name
Half the body be dancing head swoll
But one thing I can do is finger roll
The hit list grows like Pete Rose
As I rise above who you recognize
I wanna know that disguise
Who are you?
And wher'd you come from?
I don't know where you come from now see how you run
First on a verse I gets vertical
Flip works like a grammatical gigolo
A head from many years ago
I brought the noise on the R&B boys
The chronological
Or the ghetto celeb
Never claimed the best
Nor was I great at finesse
But everything is everything
And everything is real
It appears I shift gears
To the ears of my peers
No appeal
I'd rather be the underdog
...The underdog
Now whooooo
East to the...
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Now whooooo
East to the...
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
Ashes to ashes blunts to blunts
Some of these geez ain't real
I seen 'em once
It's the underdog
Now whooooo
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
I'm low maintenance
The picture I'm paintin
Is just intelligence
Not another nitwit you can get with
Self haters, traitors
Thinking now that later
Turned they head
Dissin something that I said
I get ill on a beat track
Make me wanna go back
Way back
Where it's not a trace of Babyface
Unplugged tempos from this undrugged temple catalog
I rather be the underdog
...The underdog
Now whooooo
East to the...
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Now whooooo
East to the...
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
...The underdog
Now whooooo
East to the...
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Now whooooo
East to the...
Live from New York
It's the underdog
Who they least expected
Live from New York"
