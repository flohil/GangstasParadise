Hop up out that motherfucker swagging
Hop up out that motherfucker dabbing
Had an old school on some 'rellis
Used to go to school in some Bally's
Flexing Macho Man Randy Savage
Oh I'm 'bout to let these niggas have it
School of hard knocks I graduated
I got all my real straight from Baby's
Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe
No matter what they say 100 joints a day
I had 'em pre rolled all yesterday
You need your passport for our second date
You know I'm fly nigga rocking reptiles
I'm whooping on this beat like a step child
Big ring and a charm to match
Ya my role model was Project Pat
Life is too short, nigga born to mac
I hop up out that coupe nigga rat, rat
Hating on the style I hope you die today
I hope they ass don't find your ass for 30 days
Mind on my money, money on the state
Ain't judge a book by its cover turn the page
I like her on the pole that's the business nigga
As soon as she get off I'mma kick it with her
Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe
No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day
Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe
Don't matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day
Time to switch it up for 'em
Time to flip it up for 'em
Got a Masi on the corner
Pull it out when I want to
Pull your bitch when I want her
Man I want another joint
Cold day now Styrofoam, that's getting to the point
East Point in this motherfucker
College Park in this motherfucker
West Side in this motherfucker
The best died in this motherfucker
My damn street know I'm riding through it
Four four two on the hood
Do this shit here for the hood
Why you niggas shit on the hood?
Two two three at the sunroof
Niggas spending like one tooth
Turn around and see white smoke when I leave out the mic booth
I'm tight nigga that's known
Put gold on the white coupe
Put gold on the white tooth
Put gold on my wife too
Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe
No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day
Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe
No matter what they say I smoke 100 joints a day
Laying by my chopper, it's laying by my safe

Niggas studying shawty know what a hundred do
Actually the nigga backing me is right in front of you
Raising a daughter sometimes depending what her father do
Niggas stunt on you, front on you
Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you, them niggas lame
I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain, dickhead
By the time you get there
I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack
Her lips and her hips thick
My boxers are covered in her lipstick
Her pussy fat but ain't good, so that's a misprint
I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond
Shiny watch look like the old Diddy on my arm
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada
Run this rap shit, I got stamina
You an amateur, I aim at 'cha, I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha
Fuck you and whoever came witcha
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha
Like a tattoo of a framed picture
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member
I got some gambling scriputres like um
Scared money don't make no money
Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga
Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
See what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes
Shamon... hm-mmm
You talk about hurting try washing clothes with no detergent
Daddy deserted so he now serves sandwich serving
Dreaming we had a furnace so cold sleeping on the curtains
What can I say it got me highly motivated, mama two job working
But now the companies emerging
Need a two week notice before they say don't need your service
I'm to young to have burdens, but still feel I should be further
But who I'm I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them
My mama need earnings, ain't had no time I had learning
Call me a hypocrite, backslider, you name it I done heard it
The way they speak of me you think I'm already murdered
It's hard to be laid back, my haters so assertive, but
I gave my life up, I gave my rights up
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up
You don't see my pain
I guess it's beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain
Sometime you don't gotta say much
Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
See what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes
Life is a game of inches
Every move leads to something better
There's no time to pay the bitches
Gotta get in the game and live forever, and ever
I'll be the man or I rather die
I'll be the man or I rather die
I'll be the man or I rather die
I'll be the man or I rather die
I'll be the man or I rather die
Scared money don't make no money

12,Birthday Song,2012,Based on a T.R.U. Story (2012),,2 Chainz,"Yeah, birthday, it's your birthday
If I die, bury me inside that Louis store
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe

Just made a jug, I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathin' if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, hold his tech
Extendo clip, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer, goin' on a trapathon
See I done have more bombs than Pakistan
Bomb, bomb, and a bomb
She, I'm ballin' you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store
True to my religion, true everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches

You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Y'all been together ten years, you deserve a Minaj
'Specially if you put that BMW in the garage
'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib
Weren't you at niece's graduation? Man, I hate those kids
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, ""Do better.""
She said, ""How 'bout I get you jewelry from the Weston?""
How 'bout she hit the west end and get her best friend?
I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit

13,Black Unicorn,2013,B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time (2013),,2 Chainz,"And when you spiral through the atmosphere
All they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy, humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Of something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod
I recall, so many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken, the joy they tried to take it
Mama said that ""The best thing you can do and be is you
This world ain't got but one, so give credit where it is due""
Ain't that the truth
And here you are, a black unicorn
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness, let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say
Cause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around
Yeah
Free at last, free at last
That's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate, sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit
And when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust, turn on your faucets
Drip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere
I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Parked out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins
Weed so strong I be seldom coughin
And I'm covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Sellin' that parcake, life ain't no arcade
Now I got more knives than the 4th grade
It's all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want to believe
Thought you had the best of me
Now I'm what you need, you need
Hear ye, hear ye
You can't come near me
Competition must fear me
Lyrically, I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth it'd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussys stinkin like Summer's eve
I practicin' repitition now I need a hundred G's
A hundred M's, hug and squeeze
Dad kept us in the Dungarees, rather rap but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got pet deers
And my homies try to act like ain't real
I put my apron on and taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group, my group focus
Hit the loker jokers with the hocus pocus
I'm the dopest you can quote this under scope
Its just me and GOAT,
Dirty ass niggas will sell your ass a key of soap
I'da seen 'em rich, I'da seen 'em broke
I'da seen it all watch the pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out it gon' be geeked
You never know he might come out to be me
It's all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want to believe
Thought you had the best of me
Now I'm what you need, you need"

All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin', my gills are flappin'
I bend some matches, then sip some gas and went kissed a dragon
I'm really rappin', I'm finger snappin', I'm pistol packin'
Y'all niggas slippin', my swag is drippin', so here's a napkin
What's really happnin' bro?
Verbal attackin', I'm showing passion
Know what I mean, see I'm the king like I'm from Akron
I'm going overboard, somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones
I'm so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer
Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin', the squad is comin'
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin', aim at ya nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnus honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin' like Kappas stompin', I'll slap a junkie
I'm having lunch with Italian Sonny, don't ask the subject
Lord why you took Rabbit from me, he say don't ask me nothing
Too many bodies, too many bangers, too many bundles
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin', I heard they stung you
It's gon' be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don't even mumble
I'm back to ballin', I'm in the back full of magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and Castrol oil
That's codeine turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In 4 minutes I'll turn this into forensics in a foreign car with a foreign broad
That's long winded, paper long, and you taking long, you just don't get it
Hung the phone up and Satan want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin' like ""Hi, officer,""
When he ask me why I was swerving, ""I'm high, officer.""
I can make it bounce by myself

Got a mansion, a condo, a cabin, I sleep in my Phantom
So high dancing with the stars to the Star Spangled Banner
I change your channel, I change your pattern, I ring your Saturn
I bang your madam, she get on top and I shake the ladder
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I play the shadows, don't play no games, I straight get at 'em
I'm on the chronic all day like it's my favorite album
A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer
If I don't get the car first, I'll have a temper tantrum
I'm innovative, I demonstrated, this nigga played it
I don't care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy, then kiss the baby
Get situated, get keys off table, then leave her 80
I really made it, get it maid, Schwarzenegger
Won't wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures
I'm so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah
I'm doing this shit like whatever
When I go I'mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself
I can make it bounce by myself"

All because of one thing: freebasing cocaine. That's all my life was, was basing, nothing else. I was on that last lap, with that checker flag about to wave me on into hell
But I got lucky, I got into rehab program down der in Redstone Arsenal down der in Alabama and with dem people helpin' me. Well that smoking white devil is no longer a part of my life. I can proudly say, that white devil is no longer a part of my life and I can proudly say, that today, I do not freebase cocaine
Now I'll take a drink, now. I will take a drink but I do not freebase cocaine. You know, well, I take a drink and I might even smoke a little reefer. You know, you know I like to smoke reefer. You know, it relaxes me and everything. A couple doobies, you know, just ta get you through the day and everything. But, far as basin goes, I don't do it
Now I'll do some toot now. Don't get me wrong. I will do some toot you know. You know if you're partying and everything, and somebody comes up and gives it to you, it's impolite not to take it there. So me and my girlfriend, Sally, we, you know, we party man I tell you. We do party. You know, I will do some toot.

Yesterday your little man got killed
And all he ever wanted was a bank roll
But he died too young kuz the game cold

Once you get in you gotta leave but you can't though
Does freedom make a motherfucker evil
To the point down your ass when he see you

Inject the ghetto with the drug, paranoia
Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways
Ain't no honor among thieves?

Came on this, Cam is trying to buy us some Guccis
It's a movie made, regardless, my crooks is the hardest
Buying crazy pots and pans, stay in apartments
Bank roll was all we ever needed
While niggaz was weeded, playing space, and pumping crack in the ceiling
Just fly young with heart, I sift in the park
Made sales, blazed a few shells, yeah who cares who you are
I'm honest, I make you cry like onions
Stay in your lane, beat the name and we done
I was legend yet, now my papar stretching, yeah, that's it
Go ask the Rocky Glass, ""I class act?""
Villas, moving-making guerrillas, the willas
The guest-star gun fights, squeeze on the squealers
Don't come near me, nigga
If you don't got no money, fear me
Matter fact, move it, ya hear me?"

She ain't never seen a nigga like me uh
Chance of that is unlikely
2 Chainz in my white tee
I wipe her down and I pipe her down
I give my girl money to go out of town
You give your girl money to go to Niketown
And I one-night her, you must like her
Kill niggas with one-liners, all I need is one lighter
Counting so much money, I got arthritis
So cold I frostbite 'em, no Pig Latin but I hog-tied 'em
If she gets this business then I (make her fall in love)
With a nigga like me I'm killing this beat
Skeet skeet skeet skeet, skeet on my sheets
On top, from the back, I thundercat like (HOE!)
My girl got a big purse with a purse in it
And her pussy so clean I can go to church in it!
Oh Lord, O-M-G, I am the O-N-E
How ya like me now, it's cool but she want more D
Moet by the fireplace, this is how desire taste
And I'm 'bout to buy a case (leggo)

Combine all my thoughts, make my mind travel
Graduated from the streets, that's beyond tassel
In my muscle car, maybe we should arm wrestle
I'm raw, using all caps
I got A on my ballcaps
No, I didn't do it but I thought about it
If I would have did it, it would have chalk around
Yellow tape, never hesitate

So I didn't know what else to do
But motherfuckin' cry, homie
Oh yeah, I'm God's son
Tell Nas he got more than one
And me, I got more to see, more to be
Order three, started with a quarter ki'
I'm so ill I need penicill'
Rockin' ice cubes, talkin' kill at will

Coke on all sinisters, cold but no fridge in this
No to all witnesses, lie or die infamous
My style is so infamous, my style, it needs censorship
Dealer what's the business? Don't call, I'm busy bitch
Unless you 'bout your business, I'm tryna get some benjamins
Niggas say a lie on their way to the top
But you know you're too hot when they kidnap your pops
I guess that's sayin' a lot
But we ain't sayin' much, we just sendin' them shots, nigga
Death over dynasty, I'm talkin' major, not the minor league
And you the last of a dyin' breed
Follow caine like a menace to society
The richest nigga in the city cosignin' me
My shampoo days done showed me the way
As I pray, lord willin' but the killer's still vague
How can there be closure when the shooter's still in questionin'
Your niggas got rich, but when you died them niggas owed you
And everything I see is adding up to what you told me
I'm ramblin', tryna keep it to myself
I'm scramblin', still hard to hold the tears back
Never saw what I became, can't get them years back
Death before dishonor
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will
Live long enough, it'll happen to you

Surround your ass with so many shots
You'll be claustrophobic
Crib so big a dinosaur can run through that shit
I'm a shark, and you a tuna fish

I wish that they could add space
I'm getting money, fast pace
My hoes gave my cash straight

She the opposite of last place
Do it, bust it open, slow it down, Robitussin
My girl got a big ass
Your girl got back pockets touching
I want a dollar, I want everything
Balls out, I let her hang
Went shopping for a wedding ring
Went on a double date with Molly and Mary Jane

Chances are it's what's her name
Chances are, if she was acting up
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time it's fine with me
Young ass an intern, with money like I built the shit
Streets talking that confirm
Go ask them who just catch it

Now I gotta charge a brick for a song
Trap guy, turned into a rap guy
No suit on but I still got trap ties
Argyles, pastels and some neckties
Shawty on the pill, X-file
40 hit 'em, leave 'em wet, baptised
And you know I'm a sucker for long hair and wet thighs
Mama see the baby, this is karmasutra
I got a present for you boo you looking at the future
As far as the past, nevermind that
I don't know who's finer, you or this wine glass
And you must rewind that if you don't get it
Got a taste of the good life and tracks is what I'm eatin
My chromosomes read Georgia Dome
Icy watch, I don't mind spending time alone
(Verse 2: Jadakiss)
Yo, get the clip out of the ashtray, put it in the air
Grab my cellphone, call my engineer
Yea, last night I was on one
Quick carwash, then I make a mall run
I'm a different brother
Louie store spending chips on some kicks
I already got, different color
40 cally chrome, on deck
All the Kush gone, gotta collect
On this mean five team parlay that a bush gone
30 minutes in the trap is a half a brick
Always hustle to get it
I never ask for shit
If it's family or money I might have to flip
I'm a say it if it's on my mind
I like to take it one day at a time

Never on the guest list
Always unexpected
In so many checks
I should make a checklist
Looking at these emcees' like they should make a deathwish
Got my girl in the kitchen, cooking ambidextrious
Left wrist, right wrist
Whip that, white bitch
This is a lifestyle, I didn't have to right this
Look at my hue blow, watch how the light hit
Look at my new ho, watch how the light hit
I done did the dollars up, die nigga
Too dehydrated to cry nigga
I was struggling, had a time limit
I wish this Aquafina bottle had wine in it
I wish that pussy had a sign in it
That said, ""want it, if you hit it then you mine nigga""

Drugs backed in 'em mean them things in
Now it's duffle bags full of green men
I swear I ain't lying if my daddy hadn't died

They want a verse or two
Shit, what am I supposed to do?
Put 'em in a fucking hearse or two
I'm the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too
And I smoke just to ease the pain
So hungry I used to try to eat the rain
Well at least until the pizza came
Or at least until polices came
Undercovers outside my momma yard
And all the guns is in Kesha's name
In Jesus's name I pray
I say that a couple times a day
When it's time to eat, when it's time to lay
And when it's daytime it ain't my time of day, uh
I heard my little big cousin mad at me
I call him little big 'cause he younger than me
But he big, he was the high school team captain
Didn't graduate but sometimes things happen
And whatever happen that was the worst day
And who know what was going on in the first place
I love and helped raise my nigga
This year forgot to call him on his birthday
It's hard to explain my new lifestyle
A partner lockdown, got a phone and an iPod
He called to tell me happy new years
I had to tell him nigga, it's March
We had similar stars
But I ain't figured his part
They had dough and we didn't

Bought the tour bus and put some niggas in the pass
Your style good enough to put in a glass bag
You know I'm getting' mine, you should use a hashtag
Flow off the hinges tryna fuck all her friendses
Just killed her pussy, you gon' have to use forensics
Organized crime, you can put me in a lineup
Plus I got dreads, I'll pay a hundred for the line up
Appetite for destruction, and I don't a menu
So far ahead of y'all niggas, I can see you in my rearview
See you in my rearview one of your headlights out nigga

She said she tired of the generic

108,Yuck!,2012,Based on a T.R.U. Story (2012),,2 Chainz,"Yuck Daddy! Yuck!
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!
Uh, cut the top off, call it Amber Rose
Just bought a big body, time to paint the toes
Known to act a donkey on the camel-toe
Then take the camel-toe and turn it into casserole
2 Chainz talkin' on the flake's phone
Poof! Just like that the whole check gone
Former posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone
My girl came through and brought an extra body
Now that's an after party for the after party
Two-gun game, all black Ferrari
His and her Armani, put it in a tonic
And yeah, the bread good if the head good
Before benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods it was similac
I'm from where they send sharks then we send 'em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black mommy
Yeah I did it, true to my religion
Two guns on me, both with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy trues, with the skull cap
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the guns, where the love at
And if it ain't no love, I'm like fuck that
Nigga I'm so dope, you could catch a fuckin' contact
Good weed, bad bitch
Got these hoes on my dick like Brad Pitt
Whoa, I seen it all before
The bitch got a man, but she schemin' on the low
How it go? It go, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
My homies got the blickers, automatics no clickers
Huh? Codeine, no liquor
Man, life is a bitch, mine is a gold digger
I'm fucked, let's fuck
She said she on her period, I said, ""Yuck""
I called another bopper, I beat it like a copper
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch
I got the chopper for the correspondence
The codeine got me standin' horizontal
I had enough of the broken promises
So I'm in a room full of Pocahontas-es
And this shit is of the meat rack
Weed sack, big car, layin' with my seat back
We next, weed never left, holla, we back
All this ice on my and my niggas playing freeze tag
Lord forgive me, this my fourth foreign
If you baby daddy lame, you should forewarn him
I come through with the yapper on
Turn that nigga into hot bologna
I'm the type of nigga cop a Rollie, cop a benz, cop a two
Then wear it all to Church, nigga Hallelu'
Uh, I'm from the trap where the block'll pay you
Me and my nigga pass your ho like a hot potato
I be like you could get her, he be like you could get her
I be like you could have her, he be like you could have her
He be like, it don't matter, I be like, me neither
Uh, my old school got twenty-sixes on it
And I got you girl kissin' on me
Good weed, bad bitch
Got these hoes on my dick like Brad Pitt
Whoa, I seen it all before
The bitch got a man, but she schemin' on the low
How it go? It go, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
My homies got the blickers, automatics no clickers
Huh? Codeine, no liquor
Man, life is a bitch, mine is a gold digger
I'm fucked, let's fuck
She said she on her period, I said, ""Yuck""
I called another bopper, I beat it like a copper
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!
Yuck-yuck-yuck Daddy!
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch"
