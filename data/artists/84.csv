0,16,2008,The Future (2008),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"""She was only sixteen, only sixteen
I loved her so
But she was too young, to fall in love
And I was too young to know"" - Sam Cooke '(She Was) Only Sixteen'
[Verse One]:
Well it started out in the club Jut
When I ordered a couple of Buds, yeah
And I broke up a couple of buds, yeah
And I rolled up a couple of Dutches, yeah
This thing turned into that, so, I
Ended up takin' her back home
And I ended up bendin' that girl back so
When I woke up I took that girl back home
But when I took her back to the crib, crib
She left her wallet in my whip, whip
So I opened it up, looked at her face, then looked in the sky like, ""Shit, shit""
Then I thought to myself, ""Is this her weight? And she born in '92?""
Then that must mean that I was too young to realize that I was a fool (damn)
She was only sixteen (yeah yeah), only sixteen (yeah yeah)
I loved her so (I loved her so)
But she was too young (too young), to fall in love (in love)
And I was too young to know (yeah)
[Sam Cooke sample][x2]:
She was only sixteen
I loved her so
I was too young to know
She was only sixteen
She was only sixteen (yeah yeah), only sixteen (yeah yeah)
I loved her so (I loved her so)
But she was too young (too young), to fall in love (in love)
And I was too young to know (yeah)"
1,2010,2010,May 25th (2010),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"I was on Miami Beach
Saw the girl of my fantasy
She was into finer things
Bathing suits and diamond belly rings
She was something like I've never seen
Made me blow the whistle like the referee
Inside her is where I plan to be
And so to get her I'd do anything
Maybe even start a family
Or even get a house in Sandy Springs
She's so lovely like a melody
So baby, won't you come and jam with me?
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental
Well come on over to my place
No need to be wasting time
You really must be from Outer Space
Cause' you really is blowing my mind
Now I done been from state to state
But I ain't never seen your kind
Cause' every single time I look at you
Sends a tingling down my spine
Well girl, you must be mighty exhausted
Running these laps through my mind so often
Cause' I been falling, and I been calling
I think I need a map cause' I'm so lost in
The things you do when you brush your hair
When you take it to the side and toss it over there
And it ain't that fair, cause' the way she move
I stare
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental
And she's so cool
Cool like a pool in the middle of June
I sweep her off her feet
I guess you could say that I give her the broom
And she gets so international with it
Whenever she get in the mood
Cause' she's so Australlian
Down under on my didgeridoo
And she be killing it too, yeah
When she go in for the gold
Like a gymnast move
Oh, and what they saying is true
Yeah, a lady in the bed but a freak in the room
That's why she's cooly, cooly, cooly
Like a smoothie and jacuzzi
The opposite of Judge Judy
When she on duty
And she feeling me too
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove
Like an instrumental
And she was so cool
Like the other side of a pillow
So baby, let's groove

What's up. (eh) What's down. (come rock it with me)
Ladies and gentlemen, we are enterin', into the 5th dimension,
And did I mention, we gone. ha ha ha, we gone.
(Right on right on, B.o.B. now, B.o.B give it to em, shawty)
Girl I'm eons and eons beyond these peons, another human like me there will never be one,
The planet that I'm from on, I can never speak on,
The stars is what I sleep on, the moon I put my feet on
The way my aura glows you'd swear I'm made of neon, cooler than the freon that's in your Dodge Neon
The say the future's now to me it hasn't begun, stay tuned to me and there will never be a re-run
So come and leap on my body, and as we come you'll prolly feel moist like the trees on the tropics
We gone, we out it, no we don't need rockets, no we hop up on the mother ship and we gone, we slidin'
We slippin through dimensions, we hyperspace glidin', blasting through the atmosphere, frightening in the lightning
I know I'm out my mind girl, but you know you like it, so hop up on my cosmic highway so we can ride it
Shorty are you going, my way? (Ooh)
I wanna ride on my cosmic highway
(Ooh!) lets go! (Ooh!) lets go!
Look shorty I can't stay here on the earth no more
Another galaxy we must go.
Fresh up out the sky I'm like a meteorite, so in the studio, no I don't need to go write
I just came up in the game 'cause you needed more light, so by the time you're done there wont be no more mic
And people ask me Bob what kinda language is that, 'cause I be blasted to da future I may never come back
And I'm a leave with a 30 thousand light year lead, headed to a distant planet called B.o.B
And then I'm gone, man they're not ignoring it, taking off from the half court, Air Jor-i-dan
All systems is go in 10 seconds I'm orderin, hanging from the cosmos like a space ornament
Heat in my left pocket left hand, oh yeah I bring the pain, similar to an asteroid that's headed toward your brain
My lane, is something that they really cannot explain, they try to hold me down but man it's me they can't contain.
Shorty are you going, my way? (Ooh)
I wanna ride on my cosmic highway
(Ooh!) let's go! (Ooh!) let's go!
Look shorty I can't stay here on the earth no more
Another galaxy we must go.
Ooh girl come and go with me, I'll take you to my galaxy
I'm talking 'bout Venus (Venus), Jupiter (Jupiter), Mars (Mars, Mars)
And I'm sayin' girl lets ride all night, and I need ya for this ship girl to take flight
Let's go, Let's go, come on baby lemme take it off, another second we gon' blast it off!
Look shorty are you going, my way? (Ooh)
Come and ride on my cosmic highway (whoo-ooh)
Let's go, Let's go!
But I can't stay here on the earth no more
Another galaxy we must go!

5,Airplanes,2010,The Adventures of Bobby Ray (2010),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel
And they sayin' ""What would you wish for?""
If you had one chance
So airplane, airplane
Sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessing that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Then maybe yo maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what's up Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
I could really use a wish right now
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shooting stars
I-I-I could really use a wish right now
A wish, a wish right now, right now"

Of falling (mm mm mm mm)
Dreaming (oh oh oh oh)
Of falling (oh oh oh oh)
(Yeah) Let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eating lunch off of styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper comin' out the A (A-town)
Hoping for a record deal to ignore my pain (yeah)
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (woo!)
Okay, and everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sing (oh)
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they called me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Okay let's pretend like this never happened (never)
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper (rapper)
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to run away into the blackness
Now let's pretend like it was all good (good)
Like I didn't live staring in a notebook (notebook)
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should (should)
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood (hood, yeah)
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever call me B.o.B a.k.a. Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes (yeah)
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to André
Before I ever got on MySpace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
And it seems like yesterday
It was just a dream
But those days are gone (gone, gone)
And just memories (oh, oh)
And it seems like yesterday
It was just a dream
But those days are gone (gone gone)
All right let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would have been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
Marshall you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools were changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in a gymnasium, bitch
You won't amount to shit, quit daydreaming kid
You need to get your cranium checked
You thinking like an alien it just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed it
And his alarm went off to wake him off
But he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailey and Laney
These food stamps and this WIC shit
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here
He pretends that...
...Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now"

Than an empty pocket
If hundreds ain't in them
Them jeans ain't mine, I
I swear I won muthafucka
I'll never be a bum muthafucka
You talking about like it ain't about the money
You just sound like a dumb muthafucka
A house on the hill by the lake

You tryna book me for free?

A Better life is what we're after

From decatur to the majors to papers, no more neighbors
I used to say I never cared about the money until I put food on my momma's table
Follow the trail
Could've been in jail
The way that I live
Could have been fatal
Must have had an angel
It's funny how I'm always on the screen
But as a teen I never had cable
But now I won it all
The world, the ladies, the whips
I took a fantasy and made it exist
No one ever handed a shit
We took what we had and made it this shit
That's just from the dust to the luxury
Being off in the cut, the cutlery
That's the gist, that's the summary
So if you feel how I'm feeling then fuck with me!
All I want is money
Money, money, money
That's all I want

Up in the sky like an aeroplane (pwwwwn)
But no I ain't talkin' 'bout Mary Jane (nah)
And yes, there's only a few people that know what I mean when I say I'm everythang (ha)
Somewhere along the way
I done went way too far in space
And I guess, can't nobody see me here, 'cause I'm too far away
I said, somewhere along the way
I done went way too far in space
And I guess, can't nobody see me here, 'cause I'm too far away
I'm already gone
I'm already way way way up there
I'm already gone
I'm already gone as I'm way up there
I'm all alone

11,American Dreamin,2010,No Genre (2010),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"Well I got up today
And I put on my shades
And I said I was fine (I'm fine)
But everyone knew that I was lying
If you look at my face
And the way that I behave
You will still see a disguise
Even if you was blind (damn)
But now I'm saying bye, goodbye
American Dreaming
American dreaming
It's not that hard to find
Cause most of the time
I'm American sleeping
I barely can see it
But now I'm saying bye, goodbye
As I rhyme and I rap
The average listener is blind to the fact
That my mind has been tapped
I carry the World as it lies on my back
My spine coulda cracked so
Please pay me no mind as I laugh
This is all a stage every line is an act
Killing the American dream with a trap
Like a axe, I'm a put it in a sack
I'm a put it in the back of the black Cadillac
'Cause I'm traveling
Some say that I'm throw like a javelin
I'm really tryna expose to the galaxy
Then break off the mold to normalities
People called the election a tragedy
Looking at the screen like this can't be happening
I ain't saying that I'm some kind of activist
But something be attacking us
Okay, bring it back
I was filling my time just posing
Like a mannequin you pass by
Tryna make it one day to the big league
Where the girls ain't hard to find
All the time I was just searching
A plastic promised land
And I got myself entangled in a corporated plan (sign here)
But a dream is nothing
And it's everything at the same time
So you never know when you might wake up
And find you was just living a lies
Goodbye, just like Trey said
Goodbye America, Goodbye
Cause anything but the truth is a waste of time"
12,Arena,2012,Strange Clouds (2012),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"(Hook: Chris Brown)
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn I'm killing them, damn I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
(Verse 1: B.o.B)
And I'm still here with a lifestyle you would kill for
Still here with the same shoes that I had on from the get-go
Straight out of Atlanta, Georgia, for any of y'all that didn't know
And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code
My back then couldn't get dro, cause back then I was this broke
That's why I got so many hustles, Bruh man from the fifth floor
What would you do in the middle of the winter
When the sun goes down and it gets cold?
Growin' up in a house with no stove, no doors, no walls, no windows
And my brother was always fresher
I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go
So that's why now this the type of life that I live for
Comin' up as a youngin', man some nights I would vomit
I would throw up on myself 'cause I was so sick to my stomach
Now I'm the shit, fix the plumbing
Feel with my y'all, I'm this close
Spent my whole life chasin' shit, where's Nabisco?
My past memories, I miss those
Hey, all I can say is you get what you wish for
(Verse 2: T.I.)
I'm fresh off my pit-stop, flow airtight with no Ziploc
Get shit pop when my shit drop, no hip-hop, this Tip hop
I'm back standin' at the tip top where I belong, it won't be long
Till you hear me on a B.o.B song, some chick gettin' my skeet on
To touch the sole of my feet, G you gon' have to get your reach on
I'm up all the way high, all the way fly on the ground and I'm off the radar
Bernie Madoff money, dawg got killers paid off with it all
I got the juice, could you place a call and we place a call to who place a call
Don't get your part and not too hard, I disregard what you say
Back up the trunk and pass the buck, here's where I'm stoppin' today
Got swag all on me, homie, can't wipe it away we too ill, ill
That's how we got arenas, dumps, and stadiums feel
How you feel?
(Verse 3: B.o.B)
And I'm still here with a black whip from the strange clouds
And I'm still here with the same team, nigga stay down
Still here for the east side, ain't a thing change but the bank account
Hands high when I come 'round 'cause I'm killin' this shit nigga, hands down
And I go hard, my passport's like a postcard
Give a fuck if I'm solo, I'll go toe-to-toe with your whole squad
With the soul of a soldier but even still I don't want no parts
And no niggas with no hearts, you cocksuckers need throat guards
I'm throwed off for the most part, a young dog with an old bark
Flow dumb, but I'm so smart, I compose art, call me Mozart
My nightlife's like a soap opera with two chicks like it's Noah's ark
They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like ""Oh God!""
From a poor child to on top like a mohawk
But I always knew I'd go far bike a gas truck with no park
So no applause, hold the applause
Just put your hand up if you know the song"

I grabbed her waist and we would move

I never meant to hurt you that's just my natural reaction
Life's just like a roller coaster, just like a roller (roller)
Life's just like a roller coaster, just like a roller (roller)
Okay okay okay okay I know I know
You ain't seen me ina while and you tryin' to figure out just where the hell did I go
Well I liked you I ain't just want sex
Well I ain't even goin' flex
First time you walked by everybody scream hair squad on deck
But you still was cool I'm a get real with you
Between b.o.b. and bobby ray
Which one appeal to you
But I ain't too mad cause at the end of the night
You still [?]
But this the least I can do
So this right here's for you

C'mon don't act like that
Cussin me out like I'm a call you back
You the one at the bar in the back
Tryin' to figure out where all the ballers at
And all that ass got you caught us fast
And you came back with us and we all got smashed
Funny how an autograph turned into all of that
Just call me the bedroom bandit
Cause after one night stands I vanish
And no I can't understand it
I don't think one man on this planet does
I'm just sayin' that even though we lookin' for panties
We still want a girl at home who can fix up a good ol' sandwich
Cause all I ever wanted was to act on my attraction
I never meant to hurt you that's just my natural reaction

I battle with depression
I got a lotta trust issues
I guess I feel neglected
I use that [?]
Now I'm just fucking reckless
I spend a lotta time
Just tryna be accepted
I canceled all my shows
I burned all my clothes
I'm going out my mind
I just need to be alone
Like the snow, like the snow
In a avalanche
It just rolls and it rolls
'Til it finally lands
It rolls
Cash, money, hoes
That's all a nigga knows
Cash, money, hoes
That's all a nigga knows
I'm sick of your suggestions
I hate the stupid questions
Just wanna be myself
I hate to be corrected
They say I need a ration
They say I ain't in a restin'
If you lookin' for a friend
Then you in the wrong profession
I cut off all my hoes
I smoke up all my drough
When you going through some shit
You just hope nobody knows
Like the snow, like the snow
In a avalanche
It just rolls and it rolls

Soon as I enter
You know who it is-a
It's the representer from the east side of Atlanta
That's known as Decatur
I got my own lane but I can't see the road
My rear view mirror's full of haters
Wouldn't wanna be ya
It's me they cannot battle
Yes I'm a mothership and you a boat without no paddle
Yes I am what they after
I'm a natural born disaster
I'm the reason your momma tell you not hang with rappers
But your momma is a minister and I'm her favorite rapper
Probably 'cause she found out that my daddy was a pastor
I wonder what she's after
But don't get it confused
There's no surprise, it's just another day in my shoes
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It's just a different day with the same shit
It's just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go

High blood pressure
If you got that sodium, nigga I got that pepper (Dr. Pepper)
Don't step up, please fall back
Y'all can't ball, all y'all are wack
Haters need hugs, you thugs need love
And groupies fall in holes that gold diggers dug
These niggas cynical 'cause I'm on there medicinal
Why they so sensitive, I guess they on their menstruals
I don't need no pencil though be consider a general
Regardless of my genre yes, I'm flawless man, in general
When I'm in the club
Girls be jigging on they tippy toes
So she take me in like her vitamins and minerals
You ain't on my signal, you analogue, I'm digital
Grand Hustle champion, someone turn my anthem on
When my jam come on, God damn I blow straight up, I am a bomb
Leaping over barriers like this was a triathlon
Every other city we go
Every other city we go
It's just a different day with the same shit
It's just a different day with the same shit
Every other city we go
Every other city we go

Now I'm the everyday topic
I'm under the microscope so I'm feeling microscopic
My shit was fading to black
Niggas thought I was Gothic
But made it to the next step like recovering alcoholics
I bounce back like a Snoop Deville with hydraulics
Ain't +Nothin' But A G-Thang+
Nigga I'm the king of pain
Veins filled with Novocaine
So I ain't even feeling y'all
I ain't even hearing y'all
Fingernails on a blackboard
They say the pen is way mightier than the sword
So I'm a spaz out to get inside the mental ward
Get my Grammy Awards
Till your faith is restored by the lord of this rap shit
Niggas got it backwards
Let's line up all the factors
Grew up in the hood but was raised in the burbs
Real pops wasn't there
So the military made me a man
And they told me, put my dreams in the can
But I still made it here, damn
Every other city we go
Every other city we go

I'm living inside of this Matrix, this video game that I'm playing
I ride around and they praise me
I crack a smile and they waving

Fired up so you know when I get to the booth I go Ham
'Cause I gotta do what I can
So I'm like Kadoosh, kadoosh, kadoosh, I don't know which side I chant
I'm kinda like a blur with these words, guess I'm always heard with these verbs
Running at a hundred kilometers
Man, pretty soon I'm a leave Earth, Earth
Earthlings, or whatever Human beings, I'm a beast
You're a feast, curly fries, onion rings
This is not a fucking game
Ain't no referee's involved
This is military combat soldiers standing guard round my yard
Entourage, Ham Squad to be exact, smoking ham, smacking back
Take your girl have her back, we don't want her round my team
She's a slut and she's a freak, but you don't know 'cause she's discreet
I swear I see everything that's a bit
Man I'm fed up to my neck with the stress
I could use a wish Hayley where you at
I guess the only exception to these girls is that I rap
But I only attack
'Cause I'm in beast mode, just beast mode
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster, Monster
Energy drinks shoulda been my sponsor
But sometimes I wonder
What is this race I run for?
I don't give a fuck about numbers so I do find it ironic
These niggas get mad at me, talking all sideways with they eyes glazed
They mad 'cause I'm straight
What the mind see's the eyes say
And they say that I went pop and the streets say
I ain't hip hop but if this not let the shit stop"

Tell me who ever stops growin' up
We're just big kids
The world's our toy
For boys and girls, for girls and boys
Tell me who ever stops growin' up
(B.o.B:)
Yeah, still ridin' big wheels, still addicted to J's
Favorite team on my fitted, in every color they make
I paint the town and every city I stay
ADD or you just never really learn how to play
A livin' breathin' walkin' memory on Memory Lane
Tell me are we really movin' or just dreamin' the place
What's today, outta space, still I'm searching something great
And the museum of broken toys, just trying to fill a void
Yeah, I wake up a different year, different peers, tables turned, I tried not to interfere
Yeah, shiftin' gear, tryna steer, things changed, see them getting smaller in my rear view mirror
Are you here, are you really here, can you hear me clear?
Biggest fear, hate to say goodbye, hate to disappear
Yeah, tell me are you really here
If it's just imagination, hate to see you disappear

Yeah, how you expect to mean somethin' to the world if the world don't mean somethin' to you? Ay
Focusin' on all the negative, the only thing that's negative is somethin' in you, ay
We become the people that hurt us the most
That's why the saying is ""keep your enemies close""
Stop givin' attention on what you don't wanna life or be prepared to experience it the most
I became everything I used to criticize
How'd I look inside the critics' eyes?
Yeah, but all roads lead home
We just to ride back at different time

Biggest fear, hate to say goodbye, hate to disappear
Yeah, tell me are you really here

And this my side of the mixtape
The songs that you are about to hear
Naw I'm just jokin, heh heh
My name is Bobby Ray
I am the guy, that plays, B.o.B
I am the guy, that you see on the TV screen
That... B.o.B is like my alter ego
And you know this side, this, this mixtape
Is to truly, get you to understand
Who I really am, and the music, that I really make
The sound that I have been crafting for years
From doin' open mics, to doin' arenas
To goin' right back, to venues, gettin' stared at
You know, just everything
Everything that I've been workin on, I've put it, into songs
And now I will share them with you for free
I'm doin' this STRICTLY, to give you music
That's the only reason I do it
So without further adieu, I introduce to you
Bobby Ray"
27,Bombs Away,2012,Strange Clouds (2012),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"(Intro: Morgan Freeman)
As the war between light and darkness continues
Heroes and villains become harder to identify
Kindred spirits separated at birth
Fighting for their place in time to be solidified
The clock ticks faster and faster
While time runs a marathon in this babylon
But see, the end is only the beginning
The beginning of the calm before the storm
(Verse 1: B.o.B)
I used to dream of success, now success is inadequate
It seems the bigger I get, it's the more they get mad at me
Cause it ain't no rules inside this fight that we battlin'
And it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it
And I swear it's like a fucked up reality
But creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate, I guess
And I ain't too big on duality, but
You think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me
So fly, no gravity
So high, Mount Everest
And the show must go on, yes
But I don't have to act in it
And they don't make a television that handles the frequencies of my channel
And there ain't no computer that can hack it
It just don't have the capacity
Hell naw that ain't happenin'
You hustle? Well we are Grand Hustle, nigga we mastered it
Y'all workin' on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes
Drink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we Catholics
And if this is an embassy, consider me ambassador
Official, no artificial preservatives or additives
I love it all, but I ain't attached to it
They call this a game because it is exactly
(Hook x2: B.o.B)
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)
(Verse 2: B.o.B)
And it seems like, in the grand scheme of it all
The world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all
How do they exist if we don't know who they are?
They can be you, they could be me, they could be queens and gods
Some say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all
From a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve
But if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed
And whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge
Fuck rules, fuck boss
You can be whatever you want
You could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold
In the springs or the falls, you could never see it all
If you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls?
Man I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far
Now I be beast mode up on these bars
Freak out a beat and then beat it up raw
Good God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety
I won't need viagra naw, even if I had a dog
I be the canine, I'd have a ball
Better watch out when you cross my yard
I am a flame, I am the spark
I am in drive, y'all are in park
Look at my shot, look at the arc
Look at the crowd as soon as I start
Look in they eyes and look in they hearts
Two middle fingers straight at the law
Sincerely yours, so pray to your lord
Cause this is a war, ain't talkin' 'bout bullets and swords
UFOs don't make any noise
When they're travelin' hyper speed, so welcome aboard
(Hook x2: B.o.B)
(Outro: Morgan Freeman)
As the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity
Unveiling the grim reality of duality
In which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt
Truth has many shades
It's not a matter of black and white, but gray
Although many, we are one, so in the final analysis
Could it be that we are fighting a war that can't be won?"

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
(B.o.B)
Ever thought about losing it
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge about twenty times
But still can't find no food in it
That's foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is an uphill battle
But y'all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol' paddle
Why so shallow? I'm just asking
What's the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of yours

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
(B.o.B)
I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like you're just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that've molded us
And if life hadn't chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where woulda wind up
'Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y'all

Then she dropped out

Trying to keep up with that lime like livin'
Just wishin for one audition and video position
But that ain't how she used to be and 2 or 3
But no she is a hoochie freak so

A little ole cutie with a booty booty
Darling, why the long face? why the long face?
Everybody loves you girl. Everyone loves you.

Twurkin that Money
Just to make her some daycare money
And to pay for the rent bill monthly
Her son is sayin' that ain't my mommy
But but 15 years down the line
She ain't the same as she's past her prime
Now it's all goin' down the drain
Say goodbye to all the fame
On behalf of WorldWide Inc.

Be needing your modeling services darling

And whenever your doin' your thang
Yep, people gonna hate on it usually (that's right)
But I'm just as human as you
I just look good while doin' it
And they telling me I have so much dope I won't know what to do with it
Well until then
I'm gonna continuin' maneuverin'
Because
I am the champion (champion, champion) (What a spectacular athlete)
I am the champion (champion, champion) (If I do say so myself)
Lights, cameras, action (action, action) (hahaha, seriously)
Whenever I play
I say. I am the champion (I am the champion)
I am the champion (I am the champion)
I say I am the champion (I am the champion)
I am the champion (I am the champion)
(Verse Two)
I look in the mirror and laugh
Like look at what I've become
Everyone calls me Bob but I'm still my mother's son
And I'm low key when I'm out now, hell no, fame ain't fun
But I stay Live like NBA on yo' Playstation
And I entertain' 'cause I'm in the game
It's easy to see I ain't into fame
'Cause I ain't
And critics say that I imitate, but I really can't
Please allow me to demonstrate
But no matter what they say
I stay charged up like a triple A
Really maine?
Really maine
I am the champion (champion, champion) (I wake up and piss excellence)
I am the champion (champion, champion) (All day)
Lights, cameras, action (action, action) (Please hold your applause)
Whenever I play (I'm kind of a big deal)
I say. I am the champion (I am the champion)

I am the champion (I am the champion)

Wow, it seems like the crowd is pandemonium!

32,Chandelier,2012,Strange Clouds (2012),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier
What's a song if it don't have words?
What's the word if it don't get heard
You can paint it anyway that you like
How can you get the picture if it come out blurred
What life taught me can't be unlearned
Another bridge can't be unburned
Can't wait till you get your firm
I could try to make it home but you're still on third, look
Your whole life need a renovation
Yeah, let me give you a demonstration
No limitations, no intimidations
I'm tryna live good, that's an understatement
They say life's about choices
In the face of defeat I declined
Put your soul into everything, never back down
That's how you leave a magazine behind
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier
The world don't stop so we don't quit
The show goes on, tomorrow's here today
So live your life and do your thing
Enjoy each moment, it could slip away
Cause nothing is promised, nothing is free
The rain of receipts are guarantees
When it's done there will be no sentence fee
Just a far away dream you've yet to reach
That's why you have to go all out for it
No half-time, gotta ball out for it
That ghoul court press, life is the test
Can't play sick, can't call out for it
'Cause I don't wanna fall, no skydive
Stand tall through it all, that's a high rise
Make a something out of absolutely nothing
That's the definition of a survivor
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier
So let me be like the trees
Where I can rest on my knees
To join the wind in the sky
If this was all a mistake, I'd rather leave this place
Than be your greedy life
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier
Just keep me shining like a chandelier
Just keep me shining like a chandelier
Hold me when I'm down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier"

Charles Hamilton:
Prisoner to my cerebellum,
So I reach out to the listeners
And my mission is I betta tell 'em
Our fear of a free mind is hearing your spirit can die anytime you need to cry so you hide it deep inside
Reason why?
How can you change what was written?
Easy don't focus your brain on what they mentioned
I got so used to tryin' to make due
I feel like I'm cheatin' when I'm faced wit a break through
The man in the mirror keep sayin' I hate you
I respond like lil' nigga I made you
Slay those sayin' they could break you
So when I take a break I go ape come back and play fool
When they think they won that's when I crush 'em
Change is imminent I evolve so its nothin'
What's the discussion?
Charles Hamilton
Change gonna come, change gonna come,
Change gonna come, change gonna come,

Asher Roth:
We've been pompous ever since Columbus couldn't work a compass
We've accomplished what we conjured up while conscious
And consciously we conquered all the eye can see
Constantly concocting more options but jobs are still obsolete
It seems so odd to me and odyssey how honesty is honestly the rarest thing upon us its astonishing
How did all the honest people vanish from the planet?
Leaving us a laundry list of problems to acknowledge
While plotting with my phonics me and sonic and Bob
Non chomp and vises as I sit down and sketch my rhymes
Stretch my mind to figure out what's next in line
The next Em, Ye, and Andre?
Nah homie its just been a long...
A long time commin'...
But I know change gonna come
Change gonna come,
Change gonna come, change gonna come
It's been a long...
A long time comin' but I know

B.o.B:
While as you listenin' to this track
You probably about to blog about it maybe say its wack
Or maybe compare the verses to see which one of us wud snap
Completely ignoring the fact that this is way more than rap
'Cause I happen to be on a magazine you happen to see this issue
Some people wish you well man some people turn against you
Some people even call up to the station just to diss you
You bitch you, you only mad at your self here's a tissue
But that ain't even my focus man that hate ain't on my menu
I'm in a different city about to rock a different venue
My girl sent me a text message just to say ""i miss you""
It wont be long before I'm home baby but the rents due, ha ha ha

Stuck in the sand, lost in the dessert, I'm trapped in the storm
In search of a shore lost in the dessert, I'm searching for more
In search of a shore trapped in the dessert, still searching for more
In search of a shore lost in the dessert, I'm trapped in the storm
I look at my life, wondering how did I travel this far
Maybe I'm blind by human desire, human design
Just a little bit further till I arrive
Or is it just a mirage fooling my mind
How foolish am I, how foolish am I
How foolish am I, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why am I here in the same club with my back to the wall?
Speeding through life just to end up running back to the start
Backward and forward in every direction, disaster's in store
Like I'm stranded at sea, it feels like the end but I know that there's more
Still I'm searching for shore, stuck out at sea and I'm searching for more

Born under the view of the eye
The world can be ruthless, foolish and blind
Abracadabra, illusion and lies
Fed food to consume and influence the mind
Sacrificial executions disguised as
Shootings and crimes, the news televises
Who pulls the strings? Who has the dots?
Asking these questions I lose track of time
So I ask, how human am I?
Maybe I'm blind by human desire, human design
Just a little bit further till I arrive

Well me and her were the 2
Me and her were together like glue
But we lived packed in a shack
Like the old lady who lived in a shoe
And we ain't really know what to do
Till one day she got her a job at WaMu
I said baby if you been thinkin' what I thinkin', then all of our problems are through
So we got together with the crew
And planned everything with the T
We got gloves and guns and bags and masks
And anything we would need
So we scoped out the facility
Really waited a couple of weeks.
Till it was time to kick in the door
Everyone down it's a robbery
You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice)
You're willing to sacrifice our love
And now you got me (Froze)
I said you got me (froze)
Because you're so c-cold
You left me cold tonight
(Verse 2: B.o.B)
So I went to my girl and said ""quit playin' and give me the cash""
But nobody suspected a thing
It was quite a spectacular act
So we get to the safe out of everyone's sight
So I take off my mask and ask
""Did your partner remember to cut the line for the panic button in the back? ""
And she paused
The look she had on her face was cold as ice
Before she could she could say the next word I heard the sirens pull out outside
So I tried to grab her and run, she pulled away and said she would be fine
She was on the clock so I guess nobody would think she was in on the crime
You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice)
You're willing to sacrifice our love
And now you got me (Froze)
I said you got me (froze)
Because you're so c-cold
You left me cold tonight
(Verse 3: B.o.B)
So I realized it was over
When the SWAT team kicked in the door
So I dropped my gun and the cash, and then I got bummed rushed to the floor
And they took me into the station
And they started the interrogation
And I said, ""I ain't sayin' a word till I get appropriate representation""
So as I get escorted out, to my surprise what do I see
That's my baby sittin' in cuffs
Tellin' the officers everything
Ans I stand there in amazement
Trying to find an explanation
And the cops come in and restrain me
And they mase me and the taze me
I said, ""baby why baby what did I do to forsake you
How can you turn your back on me you're selfish I hate you
All I ever wanted to do love you
Were you fakin'? ""
So I snatched the gun from my officer
And I cocked it and I aimed it
And said, ""this is for all the pain you done put me through you're ungrateful how could you
All I wanted to do was save you""
And here I am day 55
With 55 hundred to go
When you love a girl who is as cold as ice
Eventually you'll get froze
You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice)
You're willing to sacrifice our love
And now you got me (Froze)
I said you got me (froze)
Because you're so c-cold

Maybe even start a family
Or even get a house in Sandy Springs

Cause you really is blowing my mind

But I ain't never seen your kind
Cause every single time I look at you
Sends a tingling down my spine
Well girl, you must be mighty exhausted
Running these laps through my mind so often
'Cause I been fallin', and I been callin'
I think I need a map cause' I'm so lost in
The things you do when you brush your hair
When you take it to the side and toss it over there
And it ain't that fair, cause the way she move
I stare
And she was so cool

So baby, let's groove

And she be killin' it too, yeah
When she go in for the gold

Well I'm trapped on a roller coaster
And they won't let me go so it's totally bogus
And every single day it gets colder, colder
Till my mood get low like below the sofa
Can somebody tell me where to go?
Somewhere far away where it can't go wrong
There's way too many snakes on this globe
Now everybody sing it, everybody sing it
We created a monster, created a monster
But nobody wants some, but nobody wants some
Created a monster, created a monster
But nobody wants to kill it

I'm in the future I can get with the Jetsons
I need to leave someone give me suggestions
Fuck elections, the whole planets infected
Uh, call the doctor I could use some direction
Uh, call the reverend I could make a confession
Built just like a subatomic nuclear weapon
Everybody say it, everybody say it
We created a monster, created a monster
But nobody wants some, but nobody wants some
Created a monster, created a monster

44,Do You Have The Stamina,2009,B.o.B vs. Bobby Ray (2009),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"(Intro: sample from Kanye West's ""Pinocchio Story"")
""Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?'
For everybody that sees you, and say, 'Sign an autograph'
For everybody that sees you cry, and say, 'You oughta laugh'
You oughta laugh!""
[Chorus: Kanye West sample] + (B.o.B)
""Do you really have the stamina?""
(Do you have the stamina)
""For everybody that sees you that say, ""Where's my camera?'""
(Where's my camera)
""For everybody that sees you, to say, ""Sign an autograph""
(Sign an autograph)
""For everybody that sees you cry, and say, ""You oughta laugh""
(Say you oughta laugh) ""You oughta laugh!""
[Verse One]:
Well, posing for pictures and living on a poster
The hardest thing for me is to keep my composure
I ain't always happy, and I ain't always sad
But when the spotlight is on, you have to handle the task
And even the people that swear they love so bad
Will go and put your dirty laundry on the cover of mags
And then everyone sees it and gets a good laugh
And now, your whole persona is just a thing of the past
Now, when people see they ignore all the pain
They only think about the rumors and the mistakes you made
So that's why I don't read all the comments on the blogs
Everybody's a fan if you boo me or applaud
Now give me your energy, even if you're my enemy
Or trying to be friends with me, aggressively or timidly
Put my next to anyone in this industry
You still will never find someone that's in my league
[Chorus: Kanye West sample] + (B.o.B)
""Do you really have the stamina?""
(Do you have the stamina)
""For everybody that sees you that say, ""Where's my camera?'""
(Where's my camera)
""For everybody that sees you, to say, ""Sign an autograph""
(Sign an autograph)
""For everybody that sees you cry, and say, ""You oughta laugh""
(Say you oughta laugh) ""You oughta laugh!""
[Verse Two]:
Celebrity this, celebrity that
Reality television fiends addicted like crack and smack
My business is rap, and my business is politicking with dat
And then my business is put on the map
Yeah, the bigger I get, the better the hat
The better the slacks, the better the shirts, the more I adapt
The more you start to pay attention to my sentences
The more you'll realize why I am lyricist
And why I sacrifice my time for this experience
And why my album still isn't in your speakers yet
You think you know me now, but you ain't even seen me yet
Well, except maybe on your TV set
Bring the bridge

45,Don't Feel So Good,2010,May 25th (2010),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"Oh whoa
They say life's for livin'
Well I don't feel so good today
I guess I'll drift away
I just get this feelin'
Because this system is a cage
Like the prison gates
Dnd if you don't feel it
Then how come Independence Day
Is just a holiday
I get the feeling that this boat (I feel this boat)
Is a type of sink, cause it can't float (it can not float)
And I get the feeling that we're close (I feel we're close)
To the end of the thing that we all know (that we all know)
(Verse Two)
Well excuse my expression
But I don't give a fuck today
So there's not much to say
Hey
Well I went to my bed
But crazy thoughts kept running through my head
I need some Sudafed
Well if you were my mirror
Then you would see a very sad look on my face
The life of Bobby Ray
Hey
I get the feeling that this boat (I feel this boat)
Is a type of sink, cause it can't float (it can not float)
And I get the feeling that we're close (I feel we're close)
To the end of the thing that we all know (that we all know)
(Verse Three)
Well if I gave you a few words to show my most genuine emotion
They would not describe the way I feel inside
Actually you would have to experience an explosion
So I, just learn to control 'em
Keep my spirit high to keep my gundilini flowin'
Through the the 7-point chakra system
From my toes to the top of my head
And in between my shoulders
If ya don't know than you probably can't focus
On nothin' but it's easy, so your mind ain't yours
You're getting lied to and you don't even know it! (Damn)
The youths so blind but they eyes wide open
I get the feeling that this boat (I feel this boat)
Is a type of sink, cause it can't float (it can not float)
And I get the feeling that we're close (I feel we're close)
To the end of the thing that we all know (that we all know)"
46,Don't Let Me Fall,2010,The Adventures of Bobby Ray (2010),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"Well it was just a dream
Just a moment ago
I was up so high
Looking down at the sky
Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars
On a Saturday night
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
'Cause I'm gliding up there oh so very high
That if the clouds were to drop me
Then I'd fall out the sky
I don't really know why I'm here
I guess I'm just here for the ride
I swear, it feels like I'm dreaming
It's vividly defined, yeah
So call me whatever you want
Tie me to whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight
You know my name, so I run this town
When I'm on this mic, yeah
So here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray
I don't know, need I know
But I know, that I float
Rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes
Then I go, as my story goes
I don't mind, I've been down here before
Product of my East Decatur home
'Cause I was in the cold
Trying to keep my toes unfroze
Now I'm in your house
Now I'm in your stove
Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go
Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago
Well it was just a dream
Just a moment ago
I was up so high
Looking down at the sky
Don't let me fall

But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Yeah, by far much lower than where that pavement is
'Cause there ain't no parachute
That they can make for this
'Cause I put my pain, my heart
My soul, my faith in this
Does anyone feel like how I feel?
Then you can relate to this
I just blazed with this
Maybe roll one up then take a hit
Toast to the good life then take a sip
Vacay every day, yeah take a trip
It's easy to see I was made for this
From the womb all the way to the grave, I spit
Show y'all niggas what greatness is
Yeah, I'm talking very Lucy like making movies
To picture my life boy
You need a higher resolution
I used to cut class in day
Then runaway at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class
I don't even write
Well it was just a dream
Just a moment ago
I was up so high
Looking down at the sky
Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars
On a Saturday night
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up
Must come down

Come in LZ, so put your system on 'Shut Up'
I hit the scene, real clean like scrub dum dum
They can't compete, they speakers bust the fuck
My kick got beat, they kicks be scuffed up
They beat, just fluff fluff
They weak and scrubbed up
They be like, ""Who that is? Can you turn that down?""
'Cause they say I got too many 15's in my ride
And the Alpine is vibratin' they booty, chest and thighs
So girls be gettin' juicy wet when they get inside

48,Dr. Aden,2010,No Genre (2010),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"Well this is the mysterious case
Of Dr.Aden
Looking after her patients was her only obligation but
That was back before back before the situation
Before she got a visit from an agent
He introduced himself as an employee of the nation
He asked would she'd be willing to offer cooperation
You fit the job description and all the qualifications
If interested I need your signature on this paper
She signed the dotted line without the slightest hesitation
She then received a letter stating the rules and regulations and the military bases where she must be relocated
She is not to discuss any business that's work related
It's central America
On a classified location
Before border control
Before a illegal immigration
Inside a lab where
Chemicals are manipulated
Is where we see Dr.Aden
She's very concentrated
But her concentrations broken
When she hears a conversation
Down the halls
Small talk about destabilization and
Outta curiosity she wanders from her station
Inside a unlocked office she did some investigation
She breaks into a file with
Top secret information
Probably some of the most disturbing documentation
She ever saw in her life
The article simply stated
A study being conducted on human civilization
Deep down inside she wished it was all her imagination
She couldn't doubt it
Cause there it clearly stated
She works in a facility where viruses are created
And not only that
But member when she had her patients
She wrote out prescriptions for what she thought was medication
Her office was really just a part of the operation
She wipes her eyes as they water full of frustration
How a victim of government experimentation
Where's the justification
Where's the justification
Where's the judge when you need him
Hes probably on a vacation
Probably inside of the same countries that these events takes place in
But as the puzzle pieces fall into proper arrangement
Yes we began to see the intentions of these creations
The patterns of epidemics like
H.I.V. in the 80's
Biological chemicals designed to be contagious
There""s nothing in a business of controlling the population"

I'm like a Michelangelo painting that hangs in the vault
They gated me off, by Hendrix while he plays the guitar
Never had friends but me and Franklin was dawgs
Somewhere between insane and famous, guess my brain's a little off
I'm in the b-b-basement havin' d-d-dangerous typa thoughts
I pace for hours, hit the fuckin' vaporizer and cough
Kill everything I see and leave behind a mountain of chalk
I took the hand that I was dealt and made a house outta cards
You can't compare me to anyone, swag on Area 51
Blowin' purple crop circles, pack is loud as a intercom
Anti-gravity moon suit
Went from being who are you to chillin' with the who's who

And catch you at your home with your homies, spoil a moment
Extra-extra-terrestrial, extra clips, extra bitch
Homie I don't fear shit like exorcist your neck'll twist
Gettin' high on extra shit with extra kick to kick my ass

Unexplained things goin' in my strange brain
Unidentified flyin' object Wayne's plane
'Cause I be on that Mary, I don't fuck with plain Jane
Drugs in the backpack, no room for E.T
Eyes on my kneecaps, don't look, I'm knee deep
All I do is fall back, smoke kush and keep seeds
Swallow 'em with some water, cut myself and bleed weed
Having trouble bein' human, let alone a human being
Have trouble shootin' a breeze not a M-16 (Bop)
I fear without no understandin', that will be my own fear
And they don't understand me, I know I don't belong here

Oh, he's nice for a black guy, oh, he's smart for a rapper
Oh, that's who he's with? Oh, she's cute for a black chick
Oh, he's actually cool, I went to school with him actually
Actually, he could have has a masterpiece

Imagine a world where your greatest fears become reality
AAAA! They're pausing me!
Welcome to Fear Factor
Each show's six contestants come around the country battle each other in four extreme stunts
Ah fuck!
These stunts are designed to challenge the contestants both physically...
(Clawing noises)
And mentally (growl)
If a contestant is to afraid to complete a stunt, they're eliminated
(No way I'm doing that. It's so dangerous)
If they fail at stunts, they're eliminated
But if they succeed, they are one step closer to the grand prise: fifty thousand dollars
Six contestants, four stunts, one winner
(Yeah!)

I'm Joe Rogan
Welcome to Fear Factor
The stunts you are about to see, were designed and supervised by trained professionals
They are extremely dangerous, and should not be attempted by anyone, anywhere, anytime."

Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

While these niggas run they mouth
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
(Verse 1: T.I.)
It's the rap thespian, trap champion
Dude never lose even when you think he can't even win
Again, don't nobody do it like the kid do
Talkin' 'bout the greatest better throw him on the list too (who)
Way at the top even stopped dreamin' even in the offseason I'm steamin (hot)
Hurry up somebody better check our temperature
On the fire titan like the movie they remember us
Plus how can a nigga hate for real when resilience the only thing matchin' my brilliance
Hahaha lol niggas kill me
Look mama no guns and I'm still G
Whoda thought from baker rows center hill he get so much accomplished niggas plot to try to kill me
And keep it real we try yet and still we die out in the battle field but don't nobody feel me
(Chorus: T.I.)
While these niggas run they mouth

I never will stand still

Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
(Verse 2: B.o.B)
Yeah, sign yours sincerely
I been up on my game, really they just started listening
So when you talk about the greats you got to mention me
And if you're smellin' dro you know that I'm in the vicinity
Flawless with symmetry
Yeah, since elementary niggas bite the style like they tryna swap identities
Empty refrigerators all I see up in my memory
Now I'm in the club with complimentary Hennessy
But this a jungle so you hear the snakes slitherin'
These niggas fake like a face with no blemishes
So I'm movin' with the force of an olympian
So cold with it you would think that I invented it
Yeah, I got a million ways to get it in
All day back and forth like tennis is
Another day at the office to handle business
From the beginning I sprinted knew where the finish is
(Chorus: T.I.)
While these niggas run they mouth
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
(Verse 3: Spodee)
I heard the tip I won't and shame on they ass
Since the presence is a gift I won't refrain from the past
I'm a young stunner focused and ready to smash
Niggas on that sucka shit boy they really appeared sad
If my feet don't fail me I shall be crowned
But they never failed me before why would they fail now
I'm the one to call on look how they kept it down
Hopin they got the right number I hear the skeptical sounds
I made they ass I'm made to last
Niggas thinking that they on fire I blaze they ass (I mean it)
I'm hopin you see it comparing me to rappers is silly
Them boys stale packin up illys
And all my niggas packin the illy my fraction is gritty we large
The best kush the only reason I'm beggin' your pardon
Cats don't know how to act in the presence of don's
I'm just bein a playa while they bitches enjoyin' my charm
(Chorus: T.I.)
While these niggas run they mouth
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here

The fountain of youth I think I done found it
How you say your name? I can't pronounce it
Flying a bitch, you can go out with
You probably gon' ask me to buy a mouthpiece
She know the promoters and all the bouncers
Too much on my mind, like an accountant
She said I'm 'bout to make an announcement
Bye-bye, I think I deserve an allowance
And then the next thing
I woke up in the west wing
Say, say, say she like it rough, she like it wild
Ghetto bitch, I think she wet the towels
Now she running in and out of shows
At the same time, fucking up the couch
She wanting me to hit it for a hour
If I give it to her, she gon' run her mouth
She try to finesse me, finesse me (Finesse, finesse, finesse, finesse)

We got attached to the fact we attracted

My soul is a magnet
So if you get close then you can't go backwards
I know I'm kinda like a black hole in a galaxy
You are trapped beneath my galactic habits
I couldn't even notice the patterns, damn
But I was just so blind
You haven't called up at the perfect time
But I couldn't see it. I said I couldn't see it
Eventually I had to wisen up and open up my eyes
But I couldn't believe it, the way you looked was so deceivin
'Cause I was a fool for love
Who sadly fell in love
With a girl who couldn't love
With a girl who couldn't love
And now I'm sad in love
'Cause I'm not the only one
And I'm beatin' myself for love
For the girl who couldn't love

Lemme tell ya bout my ex
But yet so fly mommy
I probly had the chance to exit stage
Left with her sister but whenever she left I would miss her
Lady dropped me like a cut in a track
Cuddlin cats who love they cat
A puzzlin accent, was she from scandenavia
Or fantasia from asia.
Click the mouse. I took a second ta figure it out
Thinkin' it out, kissin', adrenaline in her mouth
Is it about you? her? or is it somethin' super?
Silly me still in love with a cougar!

Trying to imitate the lifestyle that she saw,
And there was no cars,
Living illusions,
Dream illusive chasing cars,
A tongue so harsh,
She could persuade a million soldiers into the dark

Pop them breaks for a minute you're so mistaken,

But she got me grabbing my coat and keys and I did I did,
I get on the express way and speed to her crib, her crib,

And it feels just like an evil deed,

As these girls go awfully crazy,
They don't know me,
But they know that they play my song on the radio station,
And I climb on top of the stage,
Wait for the beat when it drop, then I sing,
Everybody get poured up, then drink,
Then by the end of the night they faint,
After the pause, I fade to the dark,
Everybody please give a round of applause,
I leave to the car, she waits for me patiently by the bar

Verse One:
Skull and crossbones and death bandannas
A liquor store on every corner in Atlanta
Cops ridin' around tossin' niggas in the slammer
Tell me what's wrong
I could really use some answers
Now-a-days everybody wants to be a rapper
About two years ago everybody was a trapper
Obviously, money is what everybody's after
Cause slavery ain't change
It's a modern day disaster
Now these are my words from me to you
Everything you do from your shades to your shoes
From your chains to your Coupe
Came from the tube
Trust me I would know
I was raised on it too
Okay, now just let me get your attention
I'ma turn the tables so you don't get defensive
I'ma put my bullshit aside for a second
'Cause I can't be fake
Cause God won't let me
I used to wear a grill
Because it was the trend
Not because I liked it
I just wanted to fit in
Then I got ""Eastside"" tatted on my skin
And I tried to get dreads but my hair was too big
But I was lost
I ain't know who I was
What else was there to do besides look like a thug
So in my senior year at Columbia High
I dropped out of high school and I got signed
B.O.B. was the name
I ain't like Bobby Ray 'cause I was ashamed
But you can call me Bobby Ray from this day forth
And I could give a damn about the fame and fortune
Honestly I don't even listen to rap
'Cause when I turn the radio on, out comes crap
And if you make good music that's okay
But on the radio, that they don't play
It's easy to see we created a beast
Cause everybody wants to hear what they don't need
And now all the rappers got to struggle to give you
That bullshit music so they can continue
To live
The position that I'm in
Is quite an interesting predicament I admit
But you can count on me 'cause I'm refusing to give in
'Cause I'ma give you music 'cause we need it to exist
Bitch
So I'ma play my guitar
Rap about aliens and sing about stars
Till you understand that's what we are
So we ain't got to struggle no more so we don't starve
I swear to God I love you with every bar
We all got problems that need to be solved
So while I got the mic I'ma speak my thoughts
And I'ma keep it real till the day I fall"

Can you wanna like it, couldn't care less if you do or not
A reminder for those of you who forget
Here's the king partna', ya ain't bout to say a big deal I'm not
Fifty mill I got, double down why not
177 Aston Martin cash and carry off the lot
They say money talk but listen Shorty 'cause I talk a lot
Incredible, my pockets and a cherry red drop
Your money funny, big diamonds in the words red boss
We're gonna be smoking the city when I come kicking come and witness
8 hundred young women all here for Young Fif
Listen, if I really dig her, let her meet my uncle Quincy
Catch up with me suckers gonna need a solid month of Wendy
Many moons will it take you buffoons and many goons
Presents fill up any room, King back gimme room
I told the World what I'm gon do, check the charts if you want proof
Number 1 and number 2, I'll take the rest, don't mind if I do
Pull my seat up to this table in the game, where's my food
But frankly, I accomplished what they said I'll never do
Or maybe you've been sleeping or snoozing on me before
Or possibly, blocking me from opening doors
And everybody surprised now
3 years down the road
But where was everybody when albums wasn't in stores
Who cares if it ain't fair
'Cause I mean?
Bob on beast, Bob on blast, Bob is everything you say
It's finesse, an expression, an emphasis on my name
Talking record labels corporations this is entertainment
Here is what I meant
They be like ""hey Bob try this
Put on this shirt, put on these jeans
Put on this hat, that'd be the shit
Rap it like that, sing it like this
Yeah yeah yeah

My music is like a drug and I'm just feelin' enough prescription
That's school and put the beat it at the school detention
Got me Captain Hook man after low murder make me a burger
I'm so further like the place that you ain't heard of pound worker
See I get out hand to my building I am so ambitious
I got big dough that's biscuit [?]
So when I walk around that's fitness I pass fur when I visit
Overseas ball no pivot you talk about it and I love it
(Verse 3: B.o.B)
Grand hustle
Since day one you heard me
From the underground to the surface
I rose out of the fire, I emerged out of the furnace
But I knew that my time would come, And I couldn't be more deserving
Man I swear I'm good for life, but still I'm far away from perfect
Shit I'm straight like 12: 30
Call me the good, I'm burping
Chillin' with brown sugar and cinnamon
One butter scotch and one Hershey (Good God)
With a booty so big you can probably Google Earth it
I'm a hit it girl with that long jump, With hat Jackie Joyner, that Kersee
Now squirt for me, twerk it for me
I'm the professor of Real Nigga University
I hold my team down, anchorman Ron Burgundy
I'm tryin' tell you man, I'm sharper than surgery

But he who loves nothing will never have nothing at all
And you could be a superstar
But still feel like an outlaw
And never need nothing at all
But still have an empty heart
When me and my sister was literally playin' in dirt
I can still see the smile on her face, in my head I can still see the mud on my shirt
Fuckin' freezing my ass off at night with this match, tryna get this lil' fire to work
And my mom just got fired from work, and meanwhile we was gettin' evicted
Our living condition was not ideal but some kinda way we learned
That growing up poor don't make you real
They don't want to see us happy, they just sell us Happy-Meals
So we throw these records on, it's the only thing that has appeal
And the sadness disappears, so what's up with us
What to do with us, they don't know what to do
All they can do is call us thugs till they need they problem solve
Need someone to run they club
He who doesn't love what he has will never have enough

I shine bright, I'll give your girl a slight tan
I make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man
I don't even understand, why she'd ever want a man
If she ever throw it, I'd catch it like a cornerback
Like a cornerback, that's an interception
You think I give a fuck, that's a misconception

The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I said, oh what a night, oh what a night

Chop that ass down, chop chop that ass down

She do it like she do it in the mirror
Be cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears
She speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears
I'm looking for the baddest one here
I tell her like, do that there, do that there
You gotta stretch it out, girl move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there
Like hut one, hut two, girl who back there?
Who back there? I'm back there
I could take a step back and sip my cognac there
Picture perfect body, that's a Kodak there

(Verse 1: B.o.B)
Number 1 on your playlist, one of Atlanta's bravest
They wondering how I deal with the fame
I villainified, this gravy
Shout out to all the ladies
I don't know why I have to say this but
I'm into deep sea diving
I go deeper than the Navy
Behavin' like I'm mavin'
I'm crazy crazy crazy
I rise to the occupation 'cause raging's my occupation
Shouts out to my Haitians my Asians and my Caucasians, Latina
Senorita es muy caliente
They say I'm amazing but
Really it's amazing
Todays world the craziest
To make the main page
Just to be a daily topic of a conversation
Kutta's on the beat so I guess it's an operation
So call me Dr. Bob yes I'm on the job
She say I'm like a teacher before she lights my yard
Stick to the script take a shit in your draws
And I don't need to take you number girl this ain't no casting call
(Verse 2: B.o.B)
Yes she give it to me 'cause she know just how I want it
And if this where we battle we would be worthy opponents
I had to get up on it
Kinda how you do a pony
It's kinda like a bank
'Cause she knows she wants to loan it
Shout out to my gangsta
Who get down in Atlanta
Wassup to Magic City
This here should be your weather
So throw it on back 'cause I want that butt
I'm a still be hear when the sun comes up
When the sun comes up who'll still be here
With ball and a bat give me one more plaque
So I guess I might as well turn things up
I'm a burn things up like the purp you puff
Tryna get loose she poppin' that coo
But when she get through she goin' serve things up
All the bad girls in the building just shake it
One time if ya feel it now,
I ain't really trippin' bout yo homegirls with ya
I'm a bring you home with em
And she goin' get it
Lay up obe I don't really want no more
But I'm a just go fast like a baseball throw
Fast like a kenco show now I'm in the zone I ain't even playin'
In the paint no mo' I'm a take it straight to the hole
Hell yeah she know she bad
She so bad"

Down side ... came off ...
Trapping in the ...
Living with my momma, till I got busted
Down on my dick, maybe start...

Six sale phone, distribute to junkies,
Mad ... got ... to the money
Turn a war on ... then I ...

For the junkie
Billie down man ... ever since I was a youngie

Calling jury like my name was Willy Wanker,
To the club show tall like the tonker
I am the man, am the man X4
I am the man; make it jumbo
Keep the game hot like a big pot of gumbo,
Do dumb shit, but don't be thinking that I'm dumb, bro
Watch what you say, I hear it all like I'm Dumbo
Dumb Ho, you say you wanna rumbo, is you dumb ho?
Toe to Toe, you bound to stutter or stumbo
Take your tough talk down to a mumbo (mumble)
It ain't going down in my house like Mutumbo,
But its definitively an honor to light yo scalp up for the money like I'm 'pirana'?
BROTHER, brother, I consider it a pleasure
To break you down to minimal measure just for the (leasure)

I know how you want this to go
I know how you want me to flow
You want to even this go
You want me to upload a post
You want me to go back and forth with the shit I did with a random lil' ho
You want me to... hm but would be doin' the most
They want to see a nigga deep in his feelings 'cause that's where they usually go
New bitches always got somewhere to go but that's what the Uber is for
Old bitches always be down for a setup but that's what my shooters is for
Bitches be so quick to side with a bitch like they never heard rumors before
I hate emotions, I ain't good with 'em
I only fuck with trouble, put that wood in 'em
I ain't good for 'em, ain't no sugarcoatin' shit, ain't no sugarcoatin' wood in 'em
From the hood but not a hoodlum
Lines got [?] suss in 'em

Yeah
It's B-O-B-O
No I don't need no lingo
'Cause I'm on this mic I chicka-pow-pow chicka-pow-pow to the beat though
Yeah shoot it up like a free throw
Where?
From the west to the east coast
Like Neo in a pea coat
Motherfuck like Danny DeVito
Lemme get a second just to reload
'Cause I'm cool in the pocket like Debo (yes!)
Cooler than the cheetahs on the Cheetos
Don't think that I lost my touch by much
I just been chillin' at the bank like aye!
Show me to the safe
Had to get my papers straight
Now I'm okay
Now it's back to the lab, yes back to the bank
Six
So don't think that I ain't sick
That I'm in places you can't get
When you're inside of the matrix

High as levitation
High like every race in

When I'm on this mic I melt that fire
That's my job
I am a bomb
Try if ya want
Tick me off and I'm like lit up
So I wouldn't do that
I'd would sit back
Unless you got tricks, inside of a hat
Then I would eat
Still wouldn't defeat
The fact that I'm insane, yes literally
I spit on the beat
I shit on the beat
Then I wipe with an MC
Throw them in the trash
B.o.B stop
Wait a minute maybe just switch up the flow
I was on a whole different level but now I'm ready to level
With a hellfire venomous flow
Here's the thing
Clearly
I'm in a place you can't really be
I'm in a space
Called a zone
And when you inside you just kinda know
And you don't stop
Cause you just float
And if you will then I know you don't
And if you not then you go for broke
But this a jungle let me go for those

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah
I'll be in the sky
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah
I'll be in the sky
Remember when I leave,
That the one in the mirror ain't me
It's just someone that I call B.O.B
Its kinda me but it's not
Its just a mask that I got
So that I can rap and get off my block
Reminiscin my past when I was a toddler
Sittin' in grass and playin' with blocks
Failing my classes now I'm on lockdown
Now writin and readin a lot
Money and weed is in my shoe box now
While I'm tryina get me a glock
'Cause I thought I was at the end of my line
Then I find out it was all in my mind
That's why I'm here to end all the fear
We all gon die and leave from here like
I was a man with no name
Now I'm attributing mo fame
But all of this ain't gonna matter when I a die
And say good bye so long

Everyone here gonna die one day
So while I'm here, I'ma find my way
That's my forte, that's why I'm here
Shit to open up your ears and speak this real
Beatin' down the block with a shoot ya
The gold teeth don't really match with the suit
Nowadays folk would rather rap than go to school
'Cause they feel that if they black then they gotta have a tool
But y'all don't really seen that there
After all everybody wanna kick back
They wanna sit back, they wanna sip Goose,
They wanna get down, they wanna get loose,
They wanna get blown, they wanna see the truth,
They wanna get old just like you,
But since they ain't nobody gon be responsible,
I'ma gonna have to be the one to show,
I was a man with no name
Now I'm attributing mo fame
But all of this ain't gonna matter when I a die
And say good bye so long

88,I'm Beaming (All City Chess Club Remix),2010,No Genre (2010),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"I'm beamin'
My aura takes the form of the aurora borealis
Or a floral pattern, more or less a forest to your salad
The neural path I've traveled has immediate reaction
Can't you see that I am beaming? I'll be leaving in a second
Sipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions
At last, I can relax, looking past all of the action
A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present
The rest of me is heavenly, the seventh house's zenith
Yes, the fence intimidates, it's meant to keep you out (But)
Let your senses resonate and leap it in a bound ('Cause)
Freedom isn't found inside a visa or a crown
And even the voice of reason couldn't speak it out loud (But)
Mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported
To a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole (Whole)
This is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic
As he slowly comes to focus, go ahead and watch me glow
Rey Mysterio flow, stayin' clear
Of makeup-smeared hatin' queers, makin' clear this is spiritual
Though a spirit you owe, church final
Your funeral in an arena, you searchin' for fire
Or titles, or tidal waves
Tie the game like a shot from outside when it's 95 to 98
To throw slid into you left-side broke (Niggas!) (Beam!)
Boa constrictor, chokin' (Niggas!), the grown man (Beam!)
Pawns mean, your controllers get broken (Nigga!) (Beam!)
Anarchy in the Ford, you need to focus (Nigga!) (Beam!)
Love, I get none, like sayin' no to niggas
Hamiltonian's loneliness, so I hold my (Beams!) (Niggas!)
I logged on to see a c-section, a gross display
Sleep never, and Rolaids, deep lessons won't go away
I keep pressin' like my phone is afraid
To be the star, so I end it and pound it, see what the code can say
Calling all the good rappers, had to get my crew together
Fire like the fire flower, flyer than the super feather
Superman with two propellers, enter that, ninja rap
You can call it Super Shredder, boss scene, Ross theme
You can call it super better, new to this, Ludacris
Foolishness, Lu been doin' this since super letters
So I can't spell and can't mail it out
If you can't feel, it's too full, you can't peel it out
Showboatin' at the show, but you can't sell it out
I'm on the sea shepherd deck, helpin' the whales out
All my egos in the mirror, checkin' themselves out
Tweeters in the trunk, helpin' the twelves out
The speakers on bump, the rappers on acne
This track is what would happen if the rastas meet the mathletes
Yes, sir, then the Chess Club got dressed up
And went and took all the bitches of the athletes
Big up to what's been up, nigga
Pin-ups from when we clicked up and posed for these pictures, good
And the kids connected up, and they clicked snap
Hollerin', ""Yeah, we weighed on the iPhone scale app! ""
Without fail, the best to ever do it just will
Haven't done it all, but we got copy wheelwell, though
But it ain't no sweat, I got a whole outfit
And a new fitted cap that I ain't wore out yet
(Check, check, check) And I'm beamin'
Yeah, and I seen it, like a twenty-seven inch Zenith
Projected widescreen, now they got it 3D
Now we NBA'd up from development leagues
Ay, yo, they pale in comparison to stories we tell
Man, he see me on the hovercraft and he got a sail
Bubble-ass Brenda, stacked up in the window
Of whatever 'Lac truck pick her up, retail
Nigga, what? It just hit me like a Mack truck semi
On my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby
Grab my coattails and get a grip (Grab 'em)
You want the truth? Well, the truth is
This is it, pointin' out the differences
This is exquisite shit, riveting, isn't it?
Lizard king loafers on swole when I'm kickin' it
Joe, the live nigga, real rig-a-marole
You a handshake away, and them fingers is cold
Touch art, lush heart, brush my niggas' shoulder off
Now that blessed soldier know that protocol, show me y'all's
Maybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all
Roger that, scholars back, solid black, go God
Gobble Gats, go hard, condom snapped, so raw
Pompous asshole, flash flow, turn your soul on
So gone, strode strong through your lawn till the dawn
Tell you mom, name another real as John, kill a song
'Cause when you feel it, and it make yo' ass chill and calm
Payin' more than just attention for that glass I'm sippin' on
Dog, I would travel half the globe to kiss a broad
Kiddin', ma? Scratch backs, bringin' out them kitten paws
And pull a bottle out that cabinet while that kitchen's warm
Back to attendin' business, do not lay them digits wrong
Dippin' all gangsta, but a renegade, no Crip or John
This is Blu, shit is true, pyramid, period
I know what you're thinkin', thinkin' I do not belong
Tell me Diggy ain't beamin', 'course I should be on this song
Yeah, I'm a child of God, my reflection is on
Yeah, I'm only 15 and, but my sixteens is strong
Didn't want me to shine, now we sharin' the stage
Twice as good as you rhyme, only half of your age
So the remains, and it ain't even how
That Verizon flow, are you hearin' me now?
Word to Wasalu, they was sayin' my future was dark
I had the fame, but my name was missin' the art
So I'm drawin' the line, and I'm crossin' the Ts
And I'm dottin' my Is, barely catchin' my Zs
But I'll be good by the mornin', on my global grind like JoJo
They be lookin' at what I'm puttin' on and, so fly, so fresh at the SoHo
Most niggas don't know though, they can catch me on the first flight
Been workin' on a new mixtape, I got a call from Lupe
But I did it for the love, no check, mate
When people said I couldn't, I wouldn't, I made 'em believers
I come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers
From the City of Brotherly Love, they sayin' we need you
To be the voice of the people and go against all this evil
Some people hate it, but I made it, so I'm never concerned
About what they be talkin' about, I've lived and I've learned
With my dream and my drive, I determined my turn
In this business, because I'm in control, meetin' adjourned
I said, ""It's Third Degree, y'all heard of we?
I'm Dosage, have you heard of me? ""
I come from the bottom, so the top where I deserve to be
Where people say it doesn't matter to be much
I was on the Steppin' Lasers tour, and man, I shooked it up
That was random, but so what? Life is a war, better load up
If you against me, come correct, I am the bomb, watch me blow up (Boom!)
Right before your eyes, forget about the dividends
I just want to say I remember when
Well, it's B to the O, O to the B
You know it's the flow, you know that it's me, I flow to this beat
As easy as goin' to the store and holdin' receipts
And foldin' 'em neat, I'm focused as focused can be
You know I got phobias, please, approach me with peace
Or things could get heated and you'll get ferociously beat
Speakin' of ferociously beat, you know that girl 'Nique?
You know she's a freak, but anyway, back to what I'm supposed to be
Sayin' all over this beat, you know that we Gs
You see all the crowns, you know that we kings, you notice the rings
Everywhere we go, we roll with the team, yeah
And you know that we lasers, so you know that we beam
It's the All City varsity, hard-headed squad
We played y'all spades, y'all handle y'all cards
But we ain't all odds, we just blaze, man
Y'all playin' checkers in this game, this is chess, y'all pawns"

Ain't I clean? That machine, super cool, super mean
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
(T.I talking over the chorus)
Yeah, so
You already know, hey.
I'm the hottest nigga you done heard in a long time.
Introducing you to the hottest nigga you heard in a long time.
Hey
(Verse One: T.I.)
Mega pimp, super clean, the coolest in the universe
Niggas hating on what he doing just mad 'cause they ain't do it first
His name pop up when you hit play or on your Google search
Bitches bow they head and bend they knees just like they do in church
Drop doe into her purse before you get into her skirt
She agree to do the work before she get into the vert
Till my pine box drop down into the dirt
I'm a be by far the hottest nigga, known to the Earth
In the air, I fly, can't compare my
Swagger to another rapper, don't you dare try
Anyone with a pair of eyes can look and see
No legacy will ever be next to me or near by
Though I invite you all to try, hey, I'm a fair guy
Just approach with caution, be aware because I don't share my
Throne, my crown I own
Hottest flow on any song, I'm on, I'm gone, nigga
(Break: sample)
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga

Hey! B.o.B, you up next, baby!
Hey! Grand Hustle, nigga!
If I ain't the hottest nigga on the universe
I guess I'll have to do until he gets here, nigga!
[B.o.B] Here I go!
[T.I.] Hey Call me a lie, nigga! Yeah
(Verse Two: B.o.B)
I'm that nigga that you heard about through word of mouth
They probably say I change the music in the dirty south
Now that the word is out, the timing is perfect now
To take all of these hypocritical rumor and burn 'em down
If you observe the doubt, you'd see what they worried about
They say I sound like Dre when I'm rapping my verses now
Honestly, I could give a fuck what you're blurting out
Point, blank, I'm in the game rocking my jersey now
So just accept me or don't pay me no mind
Either way you're gonna be hearing me all of the time
Whether on Greg Street or 107.9
Or on your favorite rap blog on your rap website
And if that ain't right, then show me straight to the judge
Just like Brian Nichols I ain't spitting nothing but slugs
Venomous blood in my veins, chemicals up in my brain
Yes I resemble a criminal, B.o.Bizzle, you ain't fucking with mayne
[Outro: T.I.] + (B.o.B)
Okay, you got that (I'm gone, mayne
I kinda, I kinda feel like I got you, man)
Hehehe (I had to kinda show you up, man
I ain't really wanna make you look bad, really, honestly)
Ay, man, aye man that laughing, that laugh is natural
Because I'm literally amused by your sentiment
I mean if you really feel that, know what I'm sayin'
That the likes of the second verse can even
Slightly compare with the immaculate (Hahaha)
Then I must take a chuckle... Hahaha
You know what I'm saying, but never no mind
(We can have 'em blog about it)
Absolutely, man, I'll let you guys be the judge
(You know you gonna do it anyway, fuck it)
B.o.B or T.I.P. Know what I'm saying, you be the judge, dog
(Which could be the better acronym for the song)

Fury.
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
(Chorus: repeat 4X)
Ain't I clean? That machine, super cool, super mean
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
(T.I talking over the chorus)
Yeah, so
You already know, hey.
I'm the hottest nigga you done heard in a long time.
Introducing you to the hottest nigga you heard in a long time.
Hey
(Verse One: T.I.)
Mega pimp, super clean, the coolest in the universe
Niggas hating on what he doing just mad 'cause they ain't do it first
His name pop up when you hit play or on your Google search
Bitches bow they head and bend they knees just like they do in church
Drop doe into her purse before you get into her skirt
She agree to do the work before she get into the vert
Till my pine box drop down into the dirt
I'm a be by far the hottest nigga, known to the Earth
In the air, I fly, can't compare my
Swagger to another rapper, don't you dare try
Anyone with a pair of eyes can look and see
No legacy will ever be next to me or near by
Though I invite you all to try, hey, I'm a fair guy
Just approach with caution, be aware because I don't share my
Throne, my crown I own
Hottest flow on any song, I'm on, I'm gone, nigga
(Break: sample)
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
(T.I talking over chorus)
Hey! B.o.B, you up next, baby!
Hey! Grand Hustle, nigga!
If I ain't the hottest nigga on the universe
I guess I'll have to do until he gets here, nigga!
[B.o.B] Here I go!
[T.I.] Hey Call me a lie, nigga! Yeah
(Verse Two: B.o.B)
I'm that nigga that you heard about through word of mouth
They probably say I change the music in the dirty south
Now that the word is out, the timing is perfect now
To take all of these hypocritical rumor and burn 'em down
If you observe the doubt, you'd see what they worried about
They say I sound like Dre when I'm rapping my verses now
Honestly, I could give a fuck what you're blurting out
Point, blank, I'm in the game rocking my jersey now
So just accept me or don't pay me no mind
Either way you're gonna be hearing me all of the time
Whether on Greg Street or 107.9
Or on your favorite rap blog on your rap website
And if that ain't right, then show me straight to the judge
Just like Brian Nichols I ain't spitting nothing but slugs
Venomous blood in my veins, chemicals up in my brain
Yes I resemble a criminal, B.o.Bizzle, you ain't fucking with mayne
[Outro: T.I.] + (B.o.B)
Okay, you got that (I'm gone, mayne
I kinda, I kinda feel like I got you, man)
Hehehe (I had to kinda show you up, man
I ain't really wanna make you look bad, really, honestly)
Ay, man, aye man that laughing, that laugh is natural
Because I'm literally amused by your sentiment
I mean if you really feel that, know what I'm sayin'
That the likes of the second verse can even
Slightly compare with the immaculate (Hahaha)
Then I must take a chuckle... Hahaha
You know what I'm saying, but never no mind
(We can have 'em blog about it)
Absolutely, man, I'll let you guys be the judge
(You know you gonna do it anyway, fuck it)
B.o.B or T.I.P. Know what I'm saying, you be the judge, dog
(Which could be the better acronym for the song)
But you know what either way it's Grand Hustle!

We've been dancing all night, dancing machine
From the club to the floor, to your limousine
Ooh-ooh-ooh [x8]
I love all your nuances, I love all your nuances
Forgive me if I'm too honest girl that booty humongous baby you must do lunges
And up top two congas, girl you rarer than a blue comet
I'ma, keep it a million like two commas
I wanna beat it up like Ali, Muhammad
Girl you're too dope, you're too chronic, you keep it two hundred
Two piece, that's two freaks, that's two gins and two tonics
Who run it, No Genre you dumby
She love the whole crew so she paid the crew homage
Smelling like new money, new money
KL to Joburg we just played a few countries
Get out your seat hit the floor put your groove on it girl
You're all dressed up, and nowhere to be
Like beating drums, your heart never sleeps
We've been dancing all night, dancing machine
From the club to the floor, to your limousine
Ooh-ooh-ooh [x8]
What you looking for?
Party girl, you want it girl
You run yo mouth, not hooking up
And put it down we go see
What you really bout?
One time, hit you with it one time
No strings attached but you tongue tied
Give me my guitar g string I'mma strum
She gon need a salon, [?]
Ay back it up, see the rum dry
She gonna get deep like the dumb kind
She brought a lil' tree like bonsai
She gon learn today, I'm the alumni
Ay she's a drug that I've taken so much of
So much of, I could barely get a buzz off a pub
A puff ain't enough, looking for a substance to touch
Or a substance [?] in this club
Heat it up till you blush
Feel the rush feel the rush
Is it love is it lust?
I'll be the judge
Give ya body a rub
You're all dressed up, and nowhere to be
Like beating drums, your heart never sleeps
We've been dancing all night, dancing machine

92,John Doe,2013,Underground Luxury (2013),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"Seems like your heart stops working
The minute they close the curtain
And take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're taking a small break
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doing
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just cause you got somewhere to go
So you take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've got a prescription
You got an addiction
Who do you think that you're fooling
John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe, ooh oh oh ooh
Ooh oh oh ohooh ooh
Ooh oh oh ohooh ooh
Errybody's addicted to something
Errybody gotta grip onto something
Even if it's just the feel too responsible to feel maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or something to find
You're struggling in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
Till you get to the point where it's no longer private
That people that you work with noticed the signs
When you walk in the room
It gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence, you say you've been at the gym
But the way look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hiding?
John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe, ooh oh oh ooh
Ooh oh oh ohooh ooh
Ooh oh oh ohooh ooh
Yeah, I've probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to drop me
Had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up wit' me 'cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her ""Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slip and fell, clumsy me!""
Well, at least I admit it, cause the worst you could do
Is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it, well I ain't no different
I love all the money, the fame
And the parties with beautiful women
I spend so much time as an underground artist
'Cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge I become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn when they pivot
And change you perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dying to wish and to live and experience
Everything possible
When I told 'em my dreams, they just said they ain't logical
Now, I can see it - it's optical (optical)
John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe, ooh oh oh ooh

Ooh oh oh ohooh ooh"

Or is it all just a sign?
Uh, I don't start from my notebook
Ever since, never woke up
Hey, I've been travelling for lifetimes
Still I got many miles 'fore it's over
Yeah, I kept on hunting like I'm spose to
But everything in the world ain't coshure
See it's crazy when your friends turn to strangers
But then strangers running up like they know you
And the further away from the other day I go
I can feel the truth getting closer
But hey, it's a path that we all on,
If you in the fast lane or the slow one
And you might break down on the shoulder
You just gotta know who the car for the toe-truck
I guess we all gotta exit to the next boulevard where the roads are

Yeah, go role up some of that killa
We call this slasher smoking,
Gone off those Michael Myers
I can barely keep my lashes open
6 shots of the rum I'm done
Thinking about my partners death
I'm angry, in a flash he was gone
Man how can that they not rearrange me
All of my days, they clouded
All of my nights, they roudy
He told me 'Tre keep suckers in the rib
If so then smash 'em proudly'
Is it all in my head?
Am I just wasting time?
All of my rearview mirror
Looking for answers 'bout to lose my mind
Looking at the world from my rearview
Searching for an answer up high

Or are we all digitized?
They say you only get one life time

I wonder is it really a sign?

Pouring from the sands of time
Congratulations, we finally made it

Ladies and gentlemen, you are at Rebel Rock Cafe.
And who we have coming to the stage is none other than B.o.B.
(Crowd jeering)
B.O who? What? The fuck is that? I don't know who that is.
Who is B.o.B?
(B.o.B talking)
I don't really have shit to say. (Booo!) How y'all doin' tonight? (Fuck you nigga get off the stage!)
I got a little song (Don't nobody give a damn.)
I wrote on the way over here. (Fuck that nigga.)
Check it out.
I know that I'm
Left field to you, field to you, field to you
But don't it sound so
Real-to-ya, real-to-ya, real-to-ya
Tell me how it
Feel-to-you, feel-to-you, feel-to-you
Now don't it feel lovely? [x2]
Now don't it sound lovely? [x2]
I agree
(Verse One)
I'm playing out the left
Was raised up in Decatur
So I'm straight up out the deck
And G.A. is all I rep
And so they say that I'm obsessed
I grew up in the struggle so
Maybe I'm depressed
But being in the struggle is what
Gave me my success
This ain't your imagination
I ain't fakin it unless
I don't mean what I say
But what I say is what I stress
And I ain't really catholic but
Daily I confess
I ain't a Christian rapper or a civil activist
But everybody feel me because I say the realist shit
I see why haters get all mad I don't brag
So here is what I got to offer
Words of wisdom so that you can get your mind altered
I know that I'm
Left field to you, field to you, field to you
But don't it sound so
Real-to-ya, real-to-ya, real-to-ya
Tell me how it
Feel-to-you, feel-to-you, feel-to-you
Now don't it feel lovely? [x2]
Now don't it sound lovely? [x2]
Uh huh
(Verse Two)
I'm lovely like the left field
I know I ain't around shorty but I rep still
Don't get to thinkin' that I'm different
Because of the record deal
Turnin' Hollywood, c'mon is that real?
And still I got alot of agony
And stress on my chest
Cause the world ain't right
So I gotta come left
I'm a keep it 100 to the day that I rest
So take a deep breath, I guess
I know that I'm
Left field to you, field to you, field to you
But don't it sound so
Real-to-ya, real-to-ya, real-to-ya
Tell me how it
Feel-to-you, feel-to-you, feel-to-you
Now don't it feel lovely? [x2]
Now don't it sound lovely? [x2]

I'll come back home for you

So please
Tell me it's not true

Oh you, you let it all slip away
But soon you'll find

What you can't replace

I gave away my love
That I promised you I would keep
A thousand deaths I died that day
When two became one
A greater force pulled you away
So I got on my knees and begged
The silence replaced my tears

Love the way you're livin' baby, never wanna waste your time
Love it when you touch my body, makes me wanna give you mine
It's so wrong, but it feels so right
'Cause I love this feeling, and I love this life
Said I love this life, life, yeah
(B.o.B.:)
This is craziness, addicted to the pain of love and hate relationship
Or can I break I heart or can we argue breakin' shit?
I guess I take the fault for what my occupation is
The more the money come the more bizarre the day can get, bizarre the day can get
It cost bread to join the game but even more to escape the shit
I see calculated cowards taking calculated risks
This the art or making music or the art of faking shit?
This the truth, I give these boys the blues this is proof
But it's nothing they can tell me
It's nothing they can do to take my touch away, take my love away
I play to win, backstage
First we say the prayer, then we say amen, bands!

Goodness gracious, I might have enemies in high places
They so famous, but can't keep up with how my mind races
How I'm steppin' on these niggas like I've got my own rep
Nigga be or make a [?] salutations to the haters [?]
You say what's up with me, what's up with you?
It's nothing they could tell me, it's nothing they can do to take my touch away, to take my love away

Nothing's lovelier than you,

We can float off to space
Hold my hand I'll lead the way

I love her more than myself and still that ain't enough
If this a dream then I don't wanna wake up,
We go together like the tub and the showerhead above,
Ha, not even thousands and thousands of miles could amount to my love
I'd have countless sky miles
I'd climb up a mountain, climb right back down I'd,
Run across the world and jump back around,
A noun and a verb is just a sound, and a word is not profound
Enough to show my urge for her smile
I'd shout on the curb with a loudspeaker
Till the whole town heard how I felt, an amount
Nothing's lovelier than you, nothing's lovelier than you,
Nothing's lovelier than you, nothing's lovelier than you.

When I'm on campus show me your diploma
Good brains, good student
Go crazy, go stupid
It's me east side bachelor
Kicked back kush'ed out to the maximum
Fly like traveler, high like a passenger
On purp, on lavender

Down like that whenever we creep up
And we slide to the back and we stay linked up
Why the hell they hating on us
I'm living my dream don't wake me up
Ballin so long It's boring
Ballin so long I'm yawning
Haulin so long that I gotta let the flow cool off 'cause my feet just scorching
Anybody trying to get up on my level better have to feel misfortune
And you ain't never seen this brooke
You like ""can anybody tell me where the door is?""
I will never ever ever have a shortage
18 damn months been touring
And I don't ever see my house, my couch, or my bedroom set seems foreign
But I always knew there'd be bitterness
These niggas speak fluent, gibberish
Life can be ridiculous
So I ball like this on these hypocrites

Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line

Come on down to the front, and stand right here and don't be shy
I'll have you time travelin', have your mind babblin'

I see Mindfreak like, ""What's up man, what's happenin'?""

Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist

You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd
See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like pidda-dow-dow
See I deceive you with my intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave you with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you saying, it don't entertain my ego
I do this every day, hocus pocus is my steelo
I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)

Wasn't much to do, I dipped outta school
Had to play it cool, I lit up that blue
And then I flew away, in the middle of the day
Man I gotta leave, I gotta escape
I can't stick around, gotta fly away
In the middle of the day, in the middle of the day
Look
Brain's at my window pane, it feels like I'm livin' in a video game
But ain't nothing changed, 'cause it's the middle of the day
Look
I said I'm puffin with my kin folk, gone off that endo
Just doin' that same old thing, with the same old gang
So can't nothin' change
Look
Every day the time goes by, passin me by
Paranoia on my mind, but I don't know why
Somethin' 'bout the times when I'm at the bank standin in line
Don't say much, keep a straight face
If I say somethin' I'm crazy
I think the government's onto me, onto me
Wasn't much to do, I dipped outta school
Had to play it cool, I lit up that blue

I can't stick around, gotta fly away

Well I done sacrificed a lot
Just to get this rappin' life to pop
Meditatin on that after life
And if a tragic happens then I pass my life to stop
Cause a brand new life's beginning
But I ain't intending for it to be tremendous like this
The old one I had is ending, so so long I'm finished
Face to the floor getting so frustrated
Tryin' to figure out the right words to say
It's me and the clock I feel like I'm racin
Nobody knows the trouble I'm facin
Man I'm sick of waitin, gettin' impatient
Watchin my life unfold the pages
Ain't nothin' much I can do to stop it
That's why I'm blazin'
Every day the time goes by, passin me by
Paranoia on my mind, but I don't know why
Somethin' 'bout the times when I'm at the bank standin in line

I think I wanna tell y'all a little story
About a young boy, a very young boy,
Always playing games but never had a toy.
Making A's in school? Pshhh He couldn't do it
A crazy motha fucka yes everybody knew it
Long story short that nigga was me, that nigga is b,
Destined to be, a failure but I still made it out hell yeah.
I was stubborn could nobody tell me nothin'.
Walk around smokin' like I live in Amsterdam,
Middle finger to the sky like I don't give a god damn.
But rebellion is just a side effect, homicidal maybe, suicidal yes!
Boy I tell ya niggas be like why in the hell you so quiet nigga you sick?
Haha Hell yeah I'm sick nigga look at me! You can't tell?
What you think is even goin' with my head? I don't even know I need got to tell me.
Anyways let's get back to the story enough of this shit talkin' damn...
My daddy from the Barn and my momma from the Gutta,
So I guess that makes me a country motha fucka.
Anyways in school, your boy was a huslta
I had everything on deck to get that butta.
But I was headed down the wrong path,
Smokin' weed sellin weed failin out of class.
But now it's like fuck what the po think I'm a let the dro stank
But I ain't for crack y'all can have dat.
But on top of that I thought I got a bitch pregnant,
For 7 damn months I thought she was expectin'
Then I found out it wasn't mine, but that was only half the issues off my mind.
And today my parents were tellin' me
You need to go to college and you need to do this
And I was like no sir I'm straight on it I ain't trying to spend
40 thousand to be 50 thousand in debt when I graduate.
And a scholarship? what the fuck is a scholarship?
My G.P.A started with a damn decimal you know what I'm sayin' but anyways... let's go.
Back to the side of dealing with these problems,
I am back to graduate but I ain't fittin' to go to college.
So I gotta figure out how I'm a make some dollas
But I ain't in the streets so I gotta slang beats
Then I sold my first beat got a couple stacks
And just like a nigga man I spent it like that
Got a couple diamonds got a couple hats and
Filled up my closet with some shoes and some slacks
Now I am back to square one where I'm at now
Rappin' in this booth in a basement of a house.
Being a honest man I'm just trying to make it out.
But fuck it man... I'm out..."

And a scholarship? what the fuck is a scholarship?
My G.P.A started with a damn decimal you know what I'm sayin' but anyways... let's go.
Back to the side of dealing with these problems,
I am back to graduate but I ain't fittin' to go to college.
So I gotta figure out how I'm a make some dollas
But I ain't in the streets so I gotta slang beats
Then I sold my first beat got a couple stacks
And just like a nigga man I spent it like that
Got a couple diamonds got a couple hats and
Filled up my closet with some shoes and some slacks
Now I am back to square one where I'm at now
Rappin' in this booth in a basement of a house.
Being a honest man I'm just trying to make it out.
But fuck it man... I'm out..."

You're the one (Fury)
Lady (Oh yeah)
Oh, baby (oh yeah)
My sweet baby (oh yeah)
You're the one
Uh huh... I know
(Verse One)
Well it's Mr. Obituary, put beats in a cemetery
I rip a beat into pieces, like sheets in a dictionary
The teachers try tried to teach me but I was sleepin' in every class
I never passed, it didn't seem necessary
I'm super psychedelic
I'm smokin' weed whit the fairies
And if drugs are bad, throw away every CD you carry
Cause drugs have inspired every musical visionary
And this ain't even the album
So the thought alone should be scary
I do this for the geeks who feel they need to compare me
I swear I'll push this button, give me a reason or dare me
And everything gets blown and everybody gets buried
And there you have it, I shot the track like Berry
Lady (oh yeah)
Oh, baby (oh yeah)
Oh, baby (oh yeah)
Oh, baby (oh yeah)
My, my baby (oh yeah)
Oh, baby (oh yeah)
My sweet baby (oh yeah)
You're the one
I know, I know, I know, haha
(Verse Two)
They tryin' figure out, what's my business incentive
I'm simply tryin' speak to who or whatever will listen
And reach out to the kids who the doctor prescribed with Ritalin
So this for all of my aliens and all the Indigo Children
And anyone who said I would never see this position
Allow me to drop my pants and turn around for you to kiss it
Huh
But that was the motivation I needed for me to get it
And this has been a Bobby Ray Power Point presentition
I mean... presentation...

As she takes the stand
By the look in her eyes I can tell that's she knows
That she's holding the faith of my world in her hands
Yeah, fo' real
This was never the plan
It was never intended for her to end up to defend
And I guess it just happened by chance
Yeah, and you hope
You hopin' that a miracle happens
You played at the George just to bring that down
Just so you can go back and avoid a disaster
And you could still be holding her hand

We're like the last word at the end of the poem

And that was her that I cried for
Now I'd give it all away to get her back
'Cause she ain't free, no, just waiting July 4th
Yeah, no, it don't sound logical
But there's some things in this life that you gotta do

It's a revolution, it's a civilian revenge.
There's no need to move or adjust your television
Whenever an era dies, another era begins!
These American fights, these American wars,
These American stripes, these American stars,
But these American cages have American bars
We hunted for truth so we headed for y'all.
Towers are crumbling, bridges are falling,
Limits are fading, the normal is boring,
Looking at time move progressively forward
Looking the days just vanish before me.
You wanted a Benz but you couldn't afford it,
Now you were killed to put your foot in the tourist
It's a different madness and never look backwards
But this is the crisis, prepare for disaster!
Start spreading the news,
I'm leaving today!
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York,
New York!
Breaker breaker 9 breaker breaker 1 9
Could you please get an operator on the phone line?
This is not a riot it's way much more than that,
These people are dying we are under attack!
Wait let me call you back, let me get my stack
'Cause we ain't taking shit so therefore we'll fight them back
We ain't waiting on the line for a 9 1 1 9 9
Whatever man I ain't got time for all this nonsense.
Enemy responses ain't a dial tone in our home on the continent
Got me in these bandages, they jungle is our fundament
Man I swear they sleeping, they unconscious or they slumbering
So we break the peace to get a piece of what we want to get
Act like were new to this, like we can run with it.
Let them know we run this shit
And let them know just how you feel the way your country is
Now look how beautiful destruction is
Bang!
Start spreading the news
I'm leaving today!
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
New York!

And every deed
It all comes back around
And every creek
And every single cloud
Becomes the sea
And it all comes crashing down
And in the midst of everything I drown
As the sky above comes crashing down
(Down down down)
And in the midst of everything I drown (drown drown)
As the sky above comes crashing down
Sweet dreams, I hold on to
Memories, I hold on to
I don't think they really, really understand
All the pain I feel, just to make them dance
And here I go, in the studio
Can you feel my heart, now can you feel my soul
That's the way that i, think with every line
And imma be that deep till the day I die
So if you feel me now, sing it one time
The doc said I need to take these every day
But I rather ride around in a chevrolet
I don't wanna pray I don't wanna meditate
I broke up with my girlfriend yesterday
If I wanted to I could do anything
I could rap a verse but I'd rather sing
Everything goes around like a boomerang

113,Nobody Told Me,2013,Underground Luxury (2013),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"I guess I bit off more than I could chew
And nobody told me, nobody told me
Had it all and never knew
'Cause nobody told me
Nobody told me money don't make you rich
And if it did, I'm missing something
Nobody told me you can lose when you win
And if they did, I'd still be missing
Who knew that this much success will make it so hard
But that's to accept the fact that I can't go back where I left
And back track my steps, back track my steps
The records I dropped, so massive, so large
It makes it hard for hip-hop to digest
The things that I do, I guess if it's true
Well fuck it, a nigga too good to be the best
Too good to be the best, too good to be stressed
'Cause this the type of life, too good to regret
You know money don't buy you no respect
Nigga no respect, nigga no respect yeah
So what the hell is that?
I'm tryna recreate the past that I never had
And smash grills I could never smash
And live fantasies that'll never last
I guess I bit off more than I could chew
And nobody told me, nobody told me
Had it all and never knew
'Cause nobody told me
Nobody told me money don't make you rich
And if it did, I'm missing something
Nobody told me you can lose when you win
And if they did, I'd still be missing
I ran away from home just to try to make a million
Yeah, just to try to make a million
And when you get a million it's a different type of feeling
When you look around and what you really need is missing
It's like, it's like I'm suffering from a sickness
And can't find a doctor to fill out the prescription
Or diagnose the illness
Can't leave it in the book, can't buy from the dealer
And I find that ironic
Yeah, I find that ironic
How I can buy anything that I ever wanted
But I really had it all when I ain't have nothing
They always say that mo money, mo problems
I guess I, I guess I should've listened to the warning
I guess I, I guess I should anticipate the stormy weather
I guess I'd illustrate it if it's good but however
Well if it's clever
I couldn't find the words to say it better
I'm knee-deep within these endeavors
But all that glitters with gold is not treasure
I'm ready for whatever, I never let er
I work even better when I'm under pressure
They say money don't make you rich
'Cause you can't buy shit that can make you better, word
Nobody told me money don't make you rich
And if it did, I'm missing something
Nobody told me you can lose when you win

They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
But first I showed 'em then I sold em
Right in front of their face
Well this is the world that we living
One minute you the hero the next you the villain
We got up in this game just to try to make a living
We hit you with the truth while you watching television
But still these are the cards that we dealt
They kick you on the ground when you most need help
Until you dried up and they sit you on the shelf
Then you start to cry because you all by yourself
So just know if you are aware of the belt
The only way to excel is the soul that you sell
So I could care less about the clothes on myself
I'm trying to drive straight on a road made of nails
Yeah, I got to pay the toll if I fell
Or else it would be another story to tell
I'm getting to the door I can tell
I'm just waiting on the day till the glory prevails
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
But first I showed 'em then I sold em
Right in front of their face
All I know is keep going, shit don't stop
Until the huss double up put the click on top
Used to wanna have the bricks on lock
Till we went to prison saw we couldn't pick them locks
Easy decision now a n-gga think I lost my touch
Listen if I ain't the realest ever done it I ain't off by much
So please don't wake me up if I'm dreaming in the fast lane speedin' no safety belt
And it's a marathon pace yourself
In this race for wealth talkin' shit just a waste of breath
Chasing me like chasing your tail your never gon catch it
Tespect is something you never get if you never had it
I'm looking back and laughing this life of mine
Bought me all the way here form my life of crime
Just a constant reminder that the end I'll be always the one who knows all see's all
Because...
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
But first I showed 'em then I sold em
Right in front of their face
Yeah, well these are my predictions
I'll be on the top 40 with a big hit
Travelling the world trying not to get sick
And I'ma get more friends on my friends list
And then after that I'll be famous
And everyone I know will tell me that I'm changing
And then my cell phone will never stop ringing
And I'll be all over magazine pages
Yeah and they'll play my songs till they boring
And if I ever do stop touring they treat me like a foreigner
Don't believe me, ask Lauren...
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost

But now I sing (now I sing) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing sing sing sing 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world
(Verse 1: T.I.)
Man I remember before I say that wait let me issue this statement
No way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
Now I remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
Sub-standard condition still handling business
Still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
I'm rapping now reminiscing and god damn it we did it
From trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
Splitting it eight ways flip it in 8 days
Thought that wildin unruly it was just the way to behave
Kept the weight and the yay for most the paper we made in all dimes
I ain't lying the pleasure was all mine
Have big work to move but we served the small time
I always outshined the niggas with small minds
Who would have thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
Around here we developed such a sound down here
But duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
Only listen to G's that other shit I don't hear
Shit they so far in the rear how would I even care
I'm too busy being a player staring at niggas careers
But talk about it for years and now we finally here
I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing sing sing sing 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world

They say what goes up must come down but I ain't reached my cruising altitude
Take a look at what I did but can you imagine what I'm about to do
The places I'm bout to go and the money I'm bout to see
Gave bill gates some binoculars and said look out for me
Exceeded expectations even at def jam
'Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
'Cause I'm a self-made nappy-headed rich nigga
Private planes help me travel in peace
To four cities in one day and four countries in one week
'Cause I work for myself and no one else 'cause I'm too smart too
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor
Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners
Order in Singapore and lobster
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning grammys and rappers winning oscars
And they say rappers shouldn't act nah suckers
We see Samuel L.Jackson like what's up mother fucker
I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing sing sing sing 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world
(Verse 3: T.I.)
I know them haters don't stop plotting and wish you would fall
'Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all
I see you down there to y'all this ain't like I got it all
Homie I ain't get enough I'm still trying to triple up
That's why we got is street cred and akoo building up
Say I'm doing too much shit I say I ain't did enough
Remember saying damn if I could just get to a million plus
And now I'm like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
Triple that on my bond thanks to bigs and run
But never mind what I've been through just look at what I become
All the shit I've avoided what I done for my sons
And daughters and momma just call her
I sold dope and dropped out of school seems it's all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle now my family live a life of
Mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
Cousins in college where you think they get tuition from
Just for standing around wishing huh
And while you standing around looking dumb
I make it happen taking action over time got damn good at it
I used to dream (I used to dream) oh whoa
About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)
But now I sing (now I sing) oh whoa
Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world)
And now I sing sing sing sing 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
And now I sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world"

Yeah... two! Two! Two! Two
""One, is the loneliest number that you'll ever do""
(B.o.B)
Tell me, who don't wanna be at the top of this?
The top of the game, that's obvious
I'm like Superman in Metropolis
But you cain't see me through binoculars
As I fly high over the populace
Tryin' to find where the hell my childhood is
I cain't even see it with my irises
The only thing that I see is the irony
Think about the past and the life I lived
All of the days and the nights I spent
In the bottomless pit called poverty
Locked in a room, don't bother me!
So if you plan on stoppin' me
You need more than your vitamins
The rap game ain't a lottery
Go to school, get a scholarship
Cause you still gotta deal with the politics
How you gon' not deal with it?
That's like goin' up inside of a brothel
And comin' out remainin monogamous
It just don't make a lot of sense
So I just stay positive
And if you ain't where you tryin' to get
Then it's a prison of the mind you in
""One, is the loneliest number that you'll ever do"" [4X]
(Big Kuntry)
You know who this is, mayyyyne
Big Kuntry Kainnng
Only one it's only me, who gives a fuck 'bout 2 and 3?
You suckers been played out, like them damn Ferrari jeeps
I see you niggaz on the creep but y'all never next to me
Cain't see you rock climbers when I'm on my mountain peak
Why peep? Open yo' eyes - you see the cherry Mase' right?
You see the streets, rollin' with me, cause my notary certified
You a hundred deep, but they be respectin me when it's only I
Green pie, back it up, tell Matty pass the mic
Know what I'm sayin' I'm nasty right, my lyrics got me creamin dykes
I'm by myself when takin' flight, and fuckin' them girls that keep it tight
Redbox, is the movement, Tim, where's they (Home Improvement)?
While you rappers keep on tryin', I'm #1 already proven
""One, is the loneliest number that you'll ever do"" [4X]
(Mac Boney)
What is the numero uno?
I dip and I slide in my two-do'
Deez niggaz be watchin while bitches be jockin
But Boney jack keep it so cool doe
I'm seein 'em checkin' my moves out
Be careful while keepin' my tool down
They know that I'm reppin that A-Town
So why do these fuck niggaz play 'round?
I guess you can hate now - we straight
We got cake, we got bread, we got made clown
While you broke niggaz stayed down
I stayed up on my game and my business I'm paid now
I'm never gon' lay down
We (Grand) and we (Royal) y'all niggaz just stand down
For yo' homey be man down, we done ran down
Tyler bent on his ass now
I'm the head of my class now
So I'm never gon' bet for these boys that stick hands out
I prefer to keep hands down
So I know who you are when I'm throwin' my fans out
Why swing on my Denzel?
I've been ridin' and swervin these niggaz since oh-fo'
But in one-oh, I drop one mo'
So these niggaz'll know I'm the one hoe!

Hello there bad news anchor

We ain't goin' die We ain't goin' lay low
To the sky is what we aim for
From Venus to Mars
From Venus to Mars

Is counting down counting down

There's nothing to wait for
Don't let it weigh you down... down... down... down...
I need to release
Release all these demons
Screaming at me
They must be defeated
Eventually some time this century
Please pardon me cause me I'm just ventin'
But people will bleed if we don't come to grips with
These evil seas that we playin' with big business
They never solve it defenseless
And still we so senseless

I was doing fine, once upon a time
Then my brain left and it didn't say bye
Don't look at me wrong, I'm out of my mind
Like Nostradamus and da Vinci combined
So paranoid of espionage
I'm watching my doors and checking my blinds
My brain is on vacation, they telling me
And I'm bi-polar to the severity
And I need medication, apparently
And some electrocompulsive therapy
I am a rebel but yes I'm so militant
Still I'm eligible for disabilities
I am psychotic but there is no remedy
This is not figurative, this is literally
If these niggas go dumb, I go to the mental facility
See, man I'm so out there, I slap fives with E.T.

And I ain't even started, the water ain't even bubbling
The type of talk that'll probably get me in trouble with the law
Or make the government come after me in public
Won't hear this on the radio, this here ain't for publishing
This ain't that bubble gum shit, no, this ain't that double mint
Consider this a risk, I swear I see 'em building pyramids brick by brick
They'll aim at everyone going against this shit
You don't believe me? Look what happened to the Dixie Chicks
It's like nobody else complains
Till you tryna be more than a nigga with a chain
Cube already told you, they corrupted everything
And we these out here just tryna function, tryna maintain
A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
I pray in heaven ain't fuck niggas ain't allowed

And of course it's unfortunate that niggas out here robbing for Jordans
Can we not afford them but got enough to get a Glock 40
Is our views on reality kinda distorted
But still, even though I understand the story
I still fall weak for a booty that's proportionate
On the sexy short bitch, so what's the score?
Chilling with some red dogs, drinking white man's poison
Ah, now that's a forfeit
Selling what's for free for free, that's extortion
But still I'm wondering what family was present when history was recorded
A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground

I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
I pray in heaven ain't fuck niggas ain't allowed

They passing laws where they can run up in your own home
Cameras on your laptop, TV and your iPhone
The battery don't come out, that means it's always on
Smile and say cheese, yeah niggas got you
I told you fuckers three years ago 'bout the watchers
If you won't take the microchip then you can't make no dollars
This ain't no lovely day for a neighbour, ain't no Mr Rodgers
Don't let these fuckers rob us for our freedom and your rights
And you be like: ""it's on the news so it must be right""
Who's pulling the strings? Who's rolling the dice?
Who's calling the shots and who's starting the fight?
Think twice...
A 100 thousand miles an hour when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
I pray in heaven ain't fuck niggas ain't allowed

And I'm ahead of my time but I cannot rewind
The only thing I fear is the mirror in my bathroom
People look and try to see a disguise
But there is nothing that nobody can't see in light
If it's a song with a rhyme or a verse with a line
Then you understand in my mind
But you can't see past my shades

I can hear him through the wall like walk
This way they tryin' to dissuade my thoughts
I'm a slave to myself and disobey my boss
It's all in disarray this parade I walk
They get amazed when they catch a chain I toss
Amidst disarray are different ways I talk
And it hangs from your brain if my chain you caught
Like I cough without covering my mouth
I tip the scales like the King of the south
Forgot that I was fat I lost my way
But now I'm back looking for the shade I sought
And not wonders, the sky summers
So don't make me take off my stunners
Bobby Ray you know you got my numbers
And them there can't see us like hunters
But you can't see past my shades
Past my shades
Past my shades
And you can't see past my shades

They say, ""B.O.B why not put the guitar down and rap?""
It's easier to sing than put my soul on a track
Cause the media has made a competition out of rap
So constantly they comparin' me to 3 Stacks (Andre 3000)
I try to grow freely but they hold me to my past
Sayin' the music that I'm makin' doesn't appeal to the mass
Hmm
What am I to do about that?
When the syndicated radio is always playin' trash
Every single song is the same old track
About Patron, Patron, Patron and swag, swag, swag
Patron and swag and the whole hood is singin'
""Patron and swag""
And everybody wonder why the kids so bad
'Cause they only thing they know is Patron and SWAG!"

Let by gones be by gones
I tried to take the high road
But now another life's gone
What you expect from me?
To turn the other cheek
All you bring is war, asking me for peace
What you expect from me, when all you bring is greed
All you bring is war, asking me for peace
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, they say let's make America great again
Except for the slavery and the genocide
When we kill all the native and steal their tribes
And it's time we denied women's rights
Talkin' 'bout great, like the AIDS outbreak
Like when they brought crack cocaine to the hood
Like when they brought heroin to the states
Justice is not on the internet
Equality don't have a twitter account
The last words that a man should ever hear
Should never be ""Get on the ground""
Our culture so misunderstood, it's cloudy up over the hood
I think about packing my bags and leaving this country for good
Glock, Glock in my car for your probable 'cause
'Cause even the law don't follow the law
Guess it's my fault for being black
A country built on my people's backs
Up in first class, yeah my seat is black
Even when I'm bored and I'm tryna see my past
Tell me, if you had a chance, would you go back in time to see the past?
Waitin', waitin', waitin' for reparation
For the end of segregation
All we got is a month and a television station
All they teach is slavery and we celebrate it
They turn the cheek if we should perish
But just remember you can't spell America without Eric
I tried to take the high road
Let by gones be by gones
I tried to take the high road
But now another life's gone
What you expect from me?
To turn the other cheek
All you bring is war, asking me for peace
What you expect from me, when all you bring is greed
All you bring is war, asking me for peace

But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece

Got these motherfuckers blazin' and I ain't tryna say bye to my kinfolk
They choke us out like what they need a noose for?
Gentrify like fuck wherever you go
Prison walls nowadays big biz
Give us dope then lock us up to get riches

They talkin' make America great again

Just a whole lot of propaganda and lying to me and you

She was smiling to hide Jane's pain

Yes there was something about her.
She couldn't find her purpose
So she couldn't see her worth
Plain Jane [x10]
Yes there was something about her
Tell me Jane, why you can't look at the brighter things?
You think that you so plain, you hate your body and you want to exchange
So you go and do the doctor thing and the doctor asks what you want to change
You don't know, you can't explain, something about Plain Jane
She couldn't find her purpose
So she couldn't see her worth
Plain Jane [x10]
Yes there was something about her
But Jane's her name
As she lives in the souls of those
Who can't escape being vain
And she looks in the mirror in pain
And she feels ashamed
So strange
So wrapped up in the pain
She even hates her name
And she won't entertain the sunshine
Because her life, is rain
And she sick of playing all the games
But still she drowns, again
There's something about Plain Jane

We only play for keeps
No time-outs, no free throws
No refs, no penalties
No handouts, no pit stops
No cheat codes, no sleep
But the drinks are on us
If you with it then pull up a seat
When you're roaming through the jungle
Talk is nothing, talk is cheap
Time is money, money is power
Power corrupts eventually, damn
So what are the options?
What are the choices left for me?
What other rule there's left to break
I guess my faith is a quest for me
Man got a dog and ain't got no leash
Man got a crib, it ain't got no lease
Man got a floater that got no brain
But I still get brain, oh it has no teeth
Nowadays, niggas the killas on the beat
But where I was raised all of the killas was down the street
Better do your research
Feeling like I fell out of the sky and landed feet first
My swag go hard, my swag go country, watch my theme work
Hell yeah, you can sail that, the boy fend to it 'cause I took my seat first
3 course meal, full entrée, refills and I want my desert
So why not make a toast? Tomorrow could always be worst
Now keep them bottles coming by the killer liter
And get that Ana off your chest, try to keep a clean shirt
I'm so grand hustle, you ain't even in my league sir
What's up with these nerds?
They be out here, gettin' their silenced off, gettin' their leads heard
The game just ain't what it used to be, the quality is blurred
But a dying breed survives and a dynasty immerse
So put it in for out if you entirely concur
She call me hippie 'cause I live without any concern
Up on this green earth, I'm on them green herbs
Yeah yeah yeah, I stay in them trees like the keblers
And they say that I look higher in person
As a kid I played in the yard, but now I'm astro turfing
I lived the actual version of the fantasies they utter
Map stories of threesomes, they must just be seeing double
Run for cover, here comes trouble
My heart is going cold so I gotta sleep with warmer covers
Polar bear pimpin', solar flare spittin'
Somebody tell 'em that this is professional stuntin' and don't attempt it
Society is twisted, they tryna take us under
So when you see them folks, don't forget to warn a brother
I made it out alive but still the battle is a struggle
Veni, vidi, vici, I came, I saw, I conquered
The masters have murdered the game
And their name wasn't in the will
You see, my citizens are some mad rappers who's still waiting on a deal
And they jealous of my success cause my shoes cost more than their bill
But I'll never sit down at another table unless I'm invited to the meal
To some it's like conquering mountains, to me it's like stepping on heels
Remember the images in your mirror can be bigger than they appear
And the truth can be hard to swallow, the pivenous eyes of the peal
And by the looks it's about the time that you had your prescription sealed
My life, fooling speech or presentation
There are no intermissions, no time for commercial breaking
A fighter in his prime, a legend in the making
There's no debating when you let your numbers make the statement
How much must I repeat?
We only play for keeps
No time-outs, no free throws
No refs, no penalties
No handouts, no pit stops
No cheat codes, no sleep

To a far away place in a third-world city where the whole damn country was oppressed
Couldn't help but stomach what I saw but still my conscious was upset
With all the money in the world but [?] I can't express
Some thoughts is trapped inside my head so I roll a blunt to ease my stress
[?] through the USA where people constantly obsess

It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
If you ain't noticed I don't really give a damn
This life's too hard to follow rules and be takin' exams
So I decided to do music just to make some fans
So while I got the mic I want to say fuck Uncle Sam
I just think of crazy shit and try to make it jam
So when I'm tired of rappin' I sing the best I can
Simpy 'cause I ain't got nothin' better to do with time
I'd rather producin rhymes than slangin and shootin dimes
I ain't really got nothin' else to say but I'll finish it
Just to show y'all how y'all can benefit if I'm generous
I'll just write a verse, sit back and collect percentages
It's 4 o'clock and I don't even think I'm finished yet
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
I don't know why I say these things
But it's the reason why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
It's why I sing my song
My song
My song

In the middle of Paris with a Dominican bar
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect
So smile, and pack your bags real good baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while while
Girl tell me how you feel
What your fantasy?
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up
Be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush
Just take it slow
You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight

Still lean to the left like the tower out in Pisa

I could use a feature
Swagger like Ceaser, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy, and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa

How about let's make it plural?
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the wall's with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of merlot
A rose, a burgundy, travel like turbo
Brush up on your Español
We'll Barcelona bounce

142,So Hard to Breathe,2012,Strange Clouds (2012),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"Since day 1 I said fuck the fame and everything it dealt
But the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth
But the wealth attracts you haters like you mosquitoes to a well
And the waters getting deeper so I'm well set out to sail
Someone called my cell and left a voicemail
That said congratulations on the million record sales
As I'm flipping over furniture knocking shit off the shelf
I told myself I'll never get too deep not to take a breathe
But I'm sinking
And it's so hard to breathe, yeah
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
It was all I can eat
But now I'm sinking
So deep, I can't come up for air
Yeah I've seen the valley of the shadow of death
I've seen the mountains, the wild childhood
That's why I sing about it
I just try to move on and keep my peace about it
But come to think about it I can't even count the days that I've spent, starving tryna find some decent housing
That's why I'm always smiling but on this beat I seem so violent
So ask me 'bout the music scene and what the fuck I think about it
Time flies, I guess that's why I'm bugging
Just yesterday I was rapping with my brother and my cousin
If you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven
We knew that we were struggling, we just acted like we wasn't
It's either make it rapping, if not that than hustlin'
So all I see is magazine covers in this game
You either surface or you plummet
It's a thin line and I'm just tryna keep my head above it
Damn...
And it's so hard to breathe
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
It was all I can eat
But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air
Air, I-I-I
I sink away, 'cause I sink away
I sink away
I sink away, I sink away
Get carried away, get carried away
And it's so hard to breathe
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
It was all I can eat
But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air
Damn, it's never in the plans, but hey it's a long way than beating pots and pans [x3]

I can't be eco conscious, I'm always burning trees
And is there fire, fire, call it that third degree,
And call me supersonic I shake the earth beneath ya
Hell yeah you heard of me it's quite a emergency
The way I take the game and I beat it so un-unmercifully, yeah
Ladies with curly features, wait at concerts to see you
They can roll home with B.O., and maybe service me up
But if you wanna work for me then girl you need your working visas
And if you ain't working then you just should not converse with me
That's not that serious, don't take it so personally
Plus currently I prefer the girls who prefer the three C.P.O.
C.P.O. I think I think I'm Neo
I'm caught up in her Matrix and I think it's time to reload
And if this is what I caught girl I would have to appeal
I think that the defendant have some things that must reveal
Heels ha, heels ha, tell me what's the deal, man
Got me chasing you to see if I could cop a feel, huh
I gotta keep it real, kosher, kosher, kosher
'Cause she don't want that bullshit, no sir, no sir, no sir

And like a minute bundle, I had to roll them over
Had the kind of... into her motor roller

I mean below freezing and there's no reason to be so cheesy, got my own team and my own league
My own lane and my own speed, it's a long road so I don't sleep
If I don't know you I don't speak, it's a small world and it's gonna shrink
If you're full of shit, then you're gonna stink
I'm a realist I'm gonna think, with a pair of eyes so I'm gonna see
I'll be whatever the fuck I wanna be, I'll be everything except a wanna be
I'll be everything you ever wanna be, if you're clever enough you can corner me
But what's a corner to me, I'm geometry
So tell me who gave you the authority? Who the fuck are you? The authority?
What am I supposed to be orderly? pardon my honor you're charging me?
Saying something I oughta be but I got some much heart that my arteries will always be partying like a camaraderie
Man I'm already famous historically so my story is already glorious
Just like P Diddy victorious to the B.I.G. Notorius,
I'm a champion, I'm a warrior, I bring war to ya,
So if you got beef that's unfortunate, we'll hang y'all out like portraits

You have any idea what this means?
It means I'm high as fuck
They describe teens all type of stuff
Should have calmed me down, should have hyped you up
Even the side effects got side effects
As if you ain't already depressed enough
So what is abuse to smoke out, I need its use
Not even for pharmacy use
You just say no, I say let's roll up a doob
And turn up a pot of soup
Off of who? Off of like formula food
Or hormones that farmers produce?
I come with the truth, I like in the now with no roof
Don't know what a doctor would do

Was on 'til several law suits
How they'd get approved and then from the shelves it's removed?
A new one gets reintroduced
Who's makin' the rules?
The war that's on drugs did to weed what proambition did to booze
But weed doesn't kill
Can't say the same if you drunk and decide you gon' go for a cruise
The war that's on drugs actually creates all the violence

No no no no I'm talkin' bout
Real tokers who ain't never ever sober
Hahaha
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Check me out now. Check me out now
Go head then
Allow me to introduce myself again
Bob's out the office but Bobby Ray is in
Please leave a message wait, let me get a pen
I don't really need it 'cause I spit it off the lid
And every time I come around I look like I'm a pimp
Really that's the dip because the ? is on my hip
They love me 'cause I tell 'em what they really wanna hear
Slap her on that booty with a hundred dollar bill
WHAT!?
Nah I'm just playin' man sometimes I kid
Just so that my job doesn't get monotonous
Crumble up the bud, put it in a spliff
Put it in the air like I'm levitating shit
They say, ""Bob how you feel about the fame?""
Really ain't famous till Obama know my name
The game's in a drought
It was going down the drain
When I come around man its prolly gon' rain (so what's you sayin'?)
Maybe I'm just sayin' I can switch up the flow
How you can't feel me when I'm rocking this show?
Going over seas to a whole 'nother coast
Come back get a sack full of that like whoa
Yeah I can take you way back like +Whoa+
So listen two me rap sit back like whoa
And every time I rip they be like, ""That's dope""
Yeah that's dope
Nitro like colt, my flow lets go
Haha Haha
(What you be done?)
Yeah
(Is that it?)
Hell naw, we ain't done
(Let's do it)
Need to get round two in
(Verse Two)
Oh oh oh
Well the biz, the biz I'm in the music biz
I really couldn't tell you what the main objective is
Cause really that depends
On if you got a hit or just a good song that they never ever spin
And then that depends on the genre that you in
If you're a rock artist or a hip hop blend
That's where I come in
They try to box me in
But I am not a square nor a parallelogram
Yes I got several fans through Japan to Maryland
They try to shoot me down but I never ever land
And no man could never ever walk in my pants
Or live what I've lived
Or be what I am
Damn
I don't give a damn
All up in this booth try to lay this shit down
Yeah, so let me turn it down
We all around it;s a mixtape now
Stay tuned for more

We're trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hand
We're filled with so much hatred
The kids don't stand a chance,
I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance
I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance
Well,
Since I was planted at birth,
I abandoned my own planet
And I landed on Earth,
As a kid I never understood what I observed, and
Some of it was strange but most of it disturbed me
Always in detention for the lack of my attention
You can call it deficit
Really I just didn't listen
And I was always missing
The teachers like, ""Where is Bobby Simmons?""
But tryna get a record deal is all I can remember
It's funny 'cause looking back on the path that I had
On my days in the streets tryna prove that I was bad
I still elevated to the level that I'm at
(Still elevated to the level that I'm at)
Drive by steady shootin'

I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance
Sometimes it's hard to grow
While living in fear of the unknown
How can he ever give love
When no love is in his heart?
A child can barely sleep at night, too worried about tomorrow
And what if he holds-- he drowns himself
Deep down in his sorrows
Will you run and will you share your light
Tell a story, live and try
See its when we're giving hope
That we know that we can grow.

And it keeps pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue
And it's pouring down on you, but you keep on movin' through
And it's pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue
And there you are standing all alone in the rain
And the rain comes pouring down
Yeah yeah
(Verse One)
By no means am I livin' in vain, but I
Sit in the rain, I'm addicted to pain yeah
It feels good when it enters my veins
And every time I wake up it's a similar day
'Cause I'm stuck in my ways
And everywhere I go the suns runnin' away
But this is what I get for my troublesome ways
So here comes the rain to fuck up my parade
I ain't got nothing to say
And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no
And you don't know where to go, 'cause you're in the rain
And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no

And the rain comes pouring down
Yeah yeah
(Verse Two)
And as I fall into the rain
Swimmin' through the flood, tryin' to unclog the drain
If you tryin' to find me my address is Memory Lane
Livin' amongst the darkness, so the dungeon is my domain
Higher than the mountains feeling lower than the plains
But this is what I chose so how can I complain?
And tryin' to find some brain is, really not my aim
Stuck inside my head, so it replays again
And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no
And you don't know where to go, 'cause you're in the rain
And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no
And you don't know where to go, but you're in the rain

The same thing happened eon's ago
To know exactly you have to read up some more
Everyday technology speeds up some more
As is above, so is below
Some feel the heat, yet some feel the cold
We are the souls, yes we have been chose
Some roll with angels and demons and ghosts
But shh, hold up Bob, don't go there
You know that they watching, they all see and stare but
They can't stop me, I'm already there
And y'all ain't seen shit but y'all already scared
I'm gone, high like fructose, fructose
You wanna know the truth, really, you gone, you gone
It'll blow ya out ya mind like a UFO, UFO
I'm basically a resident of Pluto, Pluto
You know
But you'll probably be the same one hating
Saying every rapper is in the Free Masons
While the cops giving out free mase to your face
Now how do that taste?
I'm outta my mind
These video's tellin' y'all lies, bruh
Tellin' y'all, we holdin' evil hand signs bruh
Last time I checked I'm from the east side bruh
So do your research and make ya own mind up
'Cause us musicians have influence on the mic
But they don't like that, so they conquer and divide
Double-H N-D, hip hop never dies
So shoot all you want, but we fly
Because you know, no one man should have all that power
Obviously 'cause it's only one power
But never mind, y'all keep worshiping towers
While the clock keeps handing y'all hours
But pucker up because the truth gets sour
More sour than the sour diesel I devour
Hear me 'bout the hour, I give ya fifty vowels
When I brain storm it's like a shower
So pull out your towels
And don't let 'em play you
Do your own thing
Fuck what they do
And if you good at something make sure they pay you
And if not take a thank you
Whether they praise you, or whether they hate you
It's all about the attention that they pay you
Y'all on that grape drink
Try this grape juice
Shouts to Grand Hustle
We got that break through
And yes, it's evident we better than the rest of these competitors
Really there ain't no one else ahead of us
Y'all bust these verses off etc, etc

Kadoosh, kadoosh, kadoosh

See now when I look at faces
I give a damn and a good vibration
Cause there is no reason you should be faithless
Cause look how far a hook can take you
From up here earth looks amazing
That's ram invaded and human races
And there is no reason to debate it

Dressed up for stages and faces in similar clothes
And always I'm venting and always inventing a song, ooh
And always ascending drifting into the unknown
I wonder if we are living a show so tell me I gotta know
If I were to be honest and bold would I be a hero
'Cause if you can see the colours that glow inside my soul
If were to bleed my blood would flow a violet Vibrato
La-la-la-la, la-la [x4]
Communication is so amazing when shown
As we awaken and all the pages unfold
From such a beautiful life [x2]
Ooh ooh

Well she strike like a lightning bolt
She highly electric, a thousand volts yeah
She'll shock you up out your clothes
One strike then there she go
I'm talkin' 'bout her
Oh yeah!
I'm talkin' 'bout her
Oh yeah! I'm talkin' 'bout...
(Repeat 2X over end of Chorus)
(Talkin' 'bout her man) (Oh yeah)
(Playboy Tre)
Now baby girl's highly electric, cute but deceptive
Straight high voltage, fool with the poses
Will I smoke it? Ye ain't gotta ask me
I make her strip like Puff did Cassie
Frank White, Lil' Kim, lick her on her chest
Ain't nothin' like a tit with a lil' Henn'
Got her new, tryin' to get it in
Sayin' shit like ""Girl just once let me put it in""
I'm talkin' 'bout her
Talkin' 'bout girl, you fine as fuck
So talk about me, up in that P
Leg to the West, one leg to the East (spread 'em)
And let me go deep, like Roddy White
Stood up in it and the girl got hype
But man I don't know, somethin' ain't right
Shawty got different niggaz callin all night
I'm talkin' 'bout her
(Mickey Factz)
Jack in, jack in
Givin' me a feeling like a Blackwood, Blackwood
Momma's so appealing and I got this, option
That we can get it poppin'
And right after I plug her
I can take her to an outlet for shopping, shopping
But I don't know if I trust her
So I gotta go, peace out, he's out
Like all up in my head tweaked out
Keep out, I don't know what to think, she's out
On the town gettin' frisky
Raising the hairs on my arm when she with me
Shorty got charm
Lucky just to be with her, breathe with her
But T-R-E's with her, and he did her
Deliver her to me, currently, it worries me
What her and he did vertically
If I see her with him I pass out
No bolts, no volts or pulse I black out
Ow!
(Over end of Chorus)
(I'm talkin' 'bout her bro) (You mean her?)
(Yeah her bro) (Hehehehe)
(B.o.B)
I'm talkin' 'bout she's so psychadelic
She's so cool you can tell she gellin (hehe!)
And Led Zeppelin sell it
If she were a statue, she'd be a relic
Strikin like venom, in all white denim
Sugar in the brain cells on my neurons
I'm on her like the Hamburgler on buns
Runnin' like the marathon you run
Someone gave her a medallion
Kickin like kung-fu from Shaolin
Which means how she looks is arousing
And so I'm thinkin' how lucky her blouse is, yeah
Built like brick houses
Appraised at about eight hundred thousand, heh
And so the whole place shoutin
So for her I gotta scream this ballad, like"

The war between the words, time to ... the cannons in
I am at his...
Try to smear niggers image down,
Whos the camera man?
Where's the mainly man...
What a fuck?
Get up off the nipple, man
Let your momma have a mammogram,
Busting like Sammy Sam
Niggers can't even see me on the beta
Like a black... standing a bad exam
But fuck a punch line, fuck a metaphor
Fuck the nigger who sat at the... feeling me before!
Life is like a movie, I just write the score,
Let me ... down, maybe you can understand me more!
I got no time for this..., get up above my cock,
Put the mic down, you're looking sixty four!
I'm guessing I'm the niggers that they leant to hate
But they still watch a nigger, and they pay attention more!
Closer to my words, and closer you observe
Trying to decipher... you niggers know this shit is absurd!
You notice every verb and every adjective and every syllable,
And why compared to me there is nobody whos identical.
...General, gran hustle admirable
I'm bowling over here, give a fuck about your interviews.
Niggas talk... but they know I'm one of the coldest ... and general.
The more I ball the more the haters run
When you fuck the cane, the problems gonna come
Back down never, Ill never gonna run
Fuck life and get hot, that's what I call overcoming obstacles
Get upon my testicles, I got the sun to control
I call 'em ... I know what I gotta do
When you travel on this road, man after a while
Nobodys gonna eat besides of you!
Reaching out the other artist for a wider view
In reality artists just don't have the time for you
It is what it is, I don't take it personal
But it's a jungle out, lions don't eat vegetables.
I mean... I'm all about my...
I don't smoke ... and I'm never on a...
I'm going full speed, but I don't know where I'm heading
So keep up my yard and never touch my...
I'm on the edge, you should never cross the line
Niggers feel safe when they're online...
I'm about to show what a hell is...
So let me do this for East Side bitch ... on six!
Call it what you want, but real recognize real
So the ... true niggers don't even exist!
Ah, grand hustle, its B.o.B
Its free... not a lot of niggers bet,
So now we gonna see what's up and what's good
Bobby Ray coming to your neighborhood!
Yeah that's what's up, good news.

And I didn't know what you were thinking

No need to be in a rush
But later you can hit me up so you hit me up

168,Where Are You (B.o.B vs. Bobby Ray),2012,Strange Clouds (2012),Hip Hop,B.o.B,"Whatever happened to Bobby Ray
He used to be here for us
Then he got famous and left all of his fans in the dust
We never hear from you
You're constantly changing
And your relatives always miss you
At family occasions
And your mother misses you too
Since all of the fortune
You've been too busy recording
Now she feels unimportant
And your daddy's been going through it
Since he lost his mother
The least you could do is call him and show him, you support him
I never thought you would sell out
You're becoming so cocky
I asked you for a picture after your show
You walked right by me, I'm like
Ain't this the dude that said it ain't about the price tag
Now on your records all that you do is brag
Come on Bob
I thought you were better than that dog
What happened to Cloud 9 and Generation lost
You were my Idol, just when I thought I give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody
(Melody, melody, melody)
I heard you play this familiar melody
(Melody, melody, melody)
(Melody, melody, melody)
Whatever happened to B.o.B
He once was my favourite
I swear to God that I had all of his mixtapes on my player
He was the hood, but so different at the same time
It was like a breath of fresh air, every time he rhymed
And everybody was on him
And the world fell in love
The girls, The money, the lifestyle
All the above
I guess he stopped giving a fuck
For all of us little people
With your shades on, we can't even see you
Is that what happens, when somebody makes it off of rapping
They taste the fame and change like it's just automatic
Where's the integrity? You on that other shit
You don't even sound the same, I liked your other shit
But we'll stand beside you, cause somewhere deep inside you
There's more than what meets the eye
I swear on the Bible you were my idol
Just when I thought I give up on everything
I heard you play this familiar melody
(Melody, melody, melody)
I heard you play this familiar melody
(Melody, melody, melody)
(Melody, melody, melody)
I watched my whole life change in a couple of years
Who woulda ever thought I woulda caught the world by the ears
I swear, this shit is so much bigger than I had figured
But if it wasn't meant to be this wouldn't be my career
It's like, people only see it, the way it appears
But they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears
Blood sweat and tears, we cry but always swear there's tears
In the middle of this rap game on the battlefield
All of these shock jock interviews, tryna phone me
You never know who's gonna play you
And make you look phoney
I live and die for my team, these niggas are more than my homies
We put it all on the line,
We gave up all our belongings for this rap shit
Cause at the end of the day, it ain't just rap shit
I call it making a way for survival
Just when I thought I give up on everything
I dreamed about this familiar melody

You feel all right as long as the famine and war stays overseas
And anyone over the border
You look at like the opposing team
Is this what it's sposed to be
Or am I just talkin' emotionally
What if I expose my beliefs
That I hold real close to me
Would you call me crazy and put my face all over ya magamazines

But can you afford the cost to pay

When I say the masses
Millions of kids in classes
One of them got kept backwards
For failure to do what they asked em
They will say he was stubborn and acted
Like he wasn't the son of a pastor
So he got him a pen and pad then
Started rappin' and singin' and clappin
Just to make the days go by faster
And one day he decided he had it
And he left and he never look back at
All the relative mathematics
So he took the lies and detracted them
And divided them like a fraction
And he opened his eyes and realized
That he tapped into the galactic
Off he blasted
You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way
But can you afford the cost to pay
