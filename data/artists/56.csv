Sometimes I think
They don't deserve me
Big cold as the ice
In yah nightcap
Hit yah with yah bonnet on
By the night lamp
We don't discriminate
We just want you to participate
It takes two to tango
Now where the day go

1,Apple of My Eye,2012,Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors (2012),Hip Hop,Big Boi,"Gimme one reason why
Gimme one reason why
Why, you're the apple of my eye
In the beginning they say Eve bit it
They're still sinning
'Cause they letting every Tom Dick and Steve hit it
Therefore I'm quick to not believe in it
Like the weed with the seeds in it
Now proceed like a G pimping
And some of the things you've probably seen in your life
Made you think a certain kinda way about finding your wife
Or your better half, it's better to love and to hold
Than to never have it at all and ball on these hoes
Make your stock go up, my Apple stock split
Took a gamble caught it at forty and now it's over six
I'm rich trick and that's in hundos
So overseas you might catch us eating Nando's
Gimme one reason why
Gimme one reason why
Why, you're the apple of my eye
Some say the preacher's daughters are some of the freakiest ones
They been deprived of fun and now they just wanna cut loose
Like everybody else they wilding try to find theyself
And by the time they do they barely have nobody left over
Feeling empty and alone, cause the youth is gone
The thrill has been killed so let the truth be told
Look in the mirror my dear, and it appears
That the eyes are the window to the soul, oh
Gimme one reason why
Gimme one reason why
Why, you're the apple of my eye
I, I need a big bite baby, a big bite baby
Of your sweet red delicious love
Gimme one reason why
Gimme one reason why
Why, you're the apple of my eye
You're the apple of my eye"

3,Back Up Plan,2010,Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty (2010),Hip Hop,Big Boi,"(Intro: Big Boi)
Put that bitch in smash mode!
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan
(And one and two, now you know what to do)
Motherfucker let's go
Yeah-yeah, Let's go
Put your back into it like you Grandma do it, let's go
A-Town!
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan
[Chorus] + (Big Boi)
I knew I was wrooong for thinking that she caaaared
I knew all alooong, that's whay I stay prepaaared
{And one and two, now you know what to do}
My nigga what was I to do, but find someone elseeeeeeeeee
(Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan)
(Verse One: Big Boi)
This is how it starts
Momma fell heel over head and says you was the one
Big Boi, but she calls me Antwan
So just for fun, I went along with hon
I was young, full of cum, done for the skeet skeet, not dumb
We would meet undiscretely discrete
She in heat like beitch on a leash (BIIITCH!)
No disrespect, but metaphorically she's a beeeeast
No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding till we got slimey
Yeah, from that sweet stick thang, can't complain
I was hooked on the box like the hot Krispy Cremes
(Verse Two: Big Boi)
Well it didn't take long for me to game peeep
It was week after week, I was seeing the same freak
I be damned if we posing for pictures and throwing rice
Maybe throwing up in Vegas while Daddy's on the dice
I might (might) just put you on the chopping block tonight
Act right and you can get my second string spotlight
But if you freaking, I'm speaking clean as a whistle
This'll be the last official offer before dismissal
No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding till we got slimey
Yeah, got the latex for the fit
Because she trying to +trick Daddy+, Slip-N-Slide on this dick!
(Bridge: Big Boi w/ back up singers)
You are not the one, you are not the one
You can be my two, you can be my two
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
(And one and two, now you know what to do)
(Outro: Big Boi)
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
Now two, now two, I'mm give her back to you
I'm through, nigga
I don had enough of the nast stuff
One, two, yeah!"
4,Be Still,2010,Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty (2010),Hip Hop,Big Boi,"(Chorus: Janelle Mone)
Be still young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be still young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be wise my dear you must, learn to just be still
Until you really really know
Show me you're right, shine your light
I wonder when will I know
(Big Boi)
To hell if I don't pray
Like a mannequin in the window I don't say
A, word - I like to sit back, observe
My heart says do not disturb, and yours
Is like a doorknob, everybody get a turn (yeah)
Now that's a turnoff, girl, I'm not concerned
More like the early bird tryin' to get the worm worm
But not on those terms, you got on my nerves
Say I don't deserve you, you're gonna learn
Treat it like a perm, leave it be or let it burn (burn)
Eat 'em like an urr-ange, orange
So when they on the verge of leavin' it don't get borin
Foreign trips are taken
Just to see your smiley faces, time's a-wastin
And I don't like to waste no time
You can be down or... yeah
(Janelle Mone)
I love bein in love (bein in love)
Then you let me down, turned my heart around
Givin' up on love, makes my ocean drown
You lived in my heart
Secret melodies haunt me at night
Maybe lies and lullabies
This is my last farewell
You let me down
(Big Boi)
Yeah...
From behind the Cadillac do'...
Grip this wood, slide around real slow...
Just thinkin', mind blown
As I glare through the smoke tinted windows...
And be still"
5,CPU,2012,Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors (2012),Hip Hop,Big Boi,"And it's you that's on my computer screen
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
And it's you that's on my computer screen
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
The world is yours as soon as you log on
I'm long gone like the dro that's blown in the wind, friend
Pretend that this life is but a dream then reality syncs in
The fantasy begins and it never ends
We like to role play, throw on some Coldplay
Go get some drugs and alcohol, fuck our whole day
Now we're trapped in the matrix
While Big Brother out here making movies, nigga, don't say shit
And it's you that's on my computer screen
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
And it's you that's on my computer screen
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
The information age (age)
The age of information, but we're still enslave
So let me behave like a coon, bring the goons, go out and sell dope
That's what they shoving down our throat so I choke
And regurgitate truest lyrics I ever wrote, folk
My crew is loc'd out without the bandanas
Yet we keep it cracking like a egg yolk, nigga, that's Atlanta
By way of West Savannah
And it's you that's on my computer screen
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
And it's you that's on my computer screen
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
As I scroll through the centrefolds
Wishing that the screen was three-dimensional
I know it doesn't seem too conventional
But it'll do until I get you in the physical
And it's you that's on my computer screen
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
And it's you that's on my computer screen
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
The flash memory that I'll hold is all I know of time
What was waiting all along is all I have to realize
I've got the dial tone
The glowing screen, it means we're not alone
And it's you that's on my computer screen
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
And it's you that's on my computer screen
'Cause it's you that's on my mind
'Cause it's you that's on my mind"

7,Da Next Day,2017,Boomiverse (2017),Hip Hop,Big Boi,"I think it's time for us to stir the pot
Like the feelings in the bitter broad
Because she hurt a lot and yes I
Been aboard because I work a lot
See we done did it all still bussing
Like you jerk it out, it's nothing like
Riding a huffy or my little brother
James out chea slanging them
Puppies, slanging superstar dick
Till she say that she love me
Raps Underground Railroad but
Nothings above me, shits lovely
We stay blooming like its spring break
Flower child Cadillac look like cheese plate
Crack a smile like a gator with his mouth close
Or crocodiles from the Nile yeah we cop those
Calendar booked like library got shows
You can ask my nigga Welch these are not jokes
Or you can ask me for my help I'll send a life boat
Or life raft for yo riff raff ass I keep it classy
Like you just got a scholarship, or like a waffle house
Waitress with a dollar tip, don't like them see you sweat
Fuck all them poli'tricks, better gohe get some gold
Fuck that dollar bih, I'll daddy fat on the kill boy
Keep the party going never was a killjoy
I know you feel boy
That's me in third person sometimes I get beside myself
I call it soul searching, words and sentences in parenthesis
Everything quotable bitch remember this
And take these with yah
Sack one sack two in yah jaw on your knees with yah
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
We spit universes, birthing worlds with words
From darkness came the big boomiverse facts
I never met my match but niggas now rather listen
To the rumors first, this shits empirical, and still fearing
Till the last bitch emcee eliminated uses his dying breath
To proclaim he the most lyrical
God they done damned up
The flow, sammed up the boe came through
The door saying
This same shit before, fuck nigga bring back hop hip
These suckas sound slow but it don't stop shit
Damn sure not this
What I know so far true fusion only occurs
At the heart of a star"

It is I, the B-I-G, the B-O-I
Me oh my, ears to the street and eyes to the sky
Kept my sights on the prize, wide open, door wide
Like the thighs of a hooker spread, told the girl bye
I got bigger fish to fry, niggaz wish I would retire
Cause of the pressure I apply every time I bust a rhyme
None of the rest of ya are tryin', watch me stimulate the minds of the masses
While you niggaz kickin it like jackasses
And who you votin for, Republican or Democratic?
Don't say it doesn't matter cause that's how they stole the last one
Assassin's bullet might be waitin for Obama
Do you think they'll have a brother before Billy's baby mama?
C'mon!

A true gift from God, the stars aligned when they made me
Him and Rena's baby, their first born son
I'm Antwan Andr Patton, the only one
Bloodline of a champion with heart of the lion
I'm defyin all the laws like a caterpillar flyin
Way before my time and reside in the Dirty Dirty
Where they still hangin' nooses like we in the early '30s
Goddamn, you know who I am? {""Da-Daddy Fat Sax""}
Royal fam of Atlanta, Dungeon bitch you understand? (boy!)
This ain't what you want, let's be clear from the bungie
I write knockout songs, you spit punchlines for money

With my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky
I'm on another planet my nigga and you just fly

This is that dope-on-dope, smoke but don't choke on
It's the shit, clearly blunt junkies have been known to croak
Unless them toke of it's, THE BOOOOOOMB!
For those who think life is unfair
'Cause I blow my smoke in the air
As if no one is standin there
Then I'll roll one tonight, fo' yo' sorrows
In my chair, as I sit back smiling from ear to ear
With a fistful of your girlfriend's hair
Yes, she'll blow one tonight, fo' yo' sorrows
[Big Boi] (Too $hort)
Daddy Fat Sacks back on the scene
Money shot to a Three movies
But everything's straight like 9:15
It's back to the time machine, I believe
Back to the rhymin, back to the stick
Back to the hi-hat, tsk tsk kick
Slap, y'all nigga better think that was it
We everywhere (BEEEITCH~!)
...Like the air you breathe
Got 'em stuck like Chuck into what we weave
Like a lace front wig stuck to the forehead
Best believe I'll change the steeds
Take the lead, change the speed
Slow it down just for the sport
Nigga, ONE of my favorite rappers happens to be Too $hort
(Too $hort)
Now everybody wanna sell dope (SELL DOPE)
Got a P, got a pound, got some hoes (..NOPE!)
Jesse Jackson had a lil' bit of hope, for the folks
On a roll, back in nineteen eighty fo' (EIGHTY FO'?)
Beeeitch~!
(Big Boi)
Just to let you know that everything is straight
I say stank you very much 'cause we appreciate the hate
Now go get yourself a handgun, you fuckin' wit a great
Put it your mouth and squeeze it like your morning toothpaste {*gunshot*}
Kill yo'self like Sean Kingston, suicidal for a title
My recitals are vital and maybe needed for survival
Like the Bible or any other good book that you read
Why are 75% of our youth readin magazines?
'Cause they used to fantasy, and that's what they do to dream
Call it fiction addiction 'cause the truth is a heavy thing!
'Member when the levee scream, made the folks evacua-ezz
Yeah, I'm still speakin' about it 'cause New Orleans ain't clean
When we shout Dirty South, I don't think that is what we mean
I mean, it mean the roguh, the tough, the DANGEROUS, we reign SUPREME
Can slaughter entire teams with the ink that my pen bleeds
B-I-G, B-O-I - nigga, please!
(George Clinton - Bridge, then Outro)
Don't want no girlfriends
Just need my dope (I just need my dope)
One foot on the world when, I'm behind in my smoke
(I'm behind in my smoke)
On the back burner, you can just simmer around
But on the front burner, you betta burn, a fat one
(Roll it up... fire that shit up)
A fat one - fire it up!
A fat, fat, fat one...
This is that dope-on-dope, smoke but don't choke on
It's the shit, c-c-clearly blunt junkies have been known to croak-oak-oak
Unless them toke of it's, THE BOOOMB!
Bombardin the brain, the bong infinitely plays the place to come
Came and went, hindbells spent, b-b-b-b-bent
Take another huff and puff and choke and toke
Icky sticky sticky and stuff a bowl and
Pack a pipe, twist a blunt roll, light a JOINT~!
'Cause this is the dope-on-dope... some GOOD shit...
Yeah... Lean back and puff slow..."

15,General Patton,2010,Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty (2010),Hip Hop,Big Boi,"Get the south dick up out your mouth
What you talkin' 'bout
See we know everything you're about
So try another route
Paperboy, you can't destroy what we done built
Pick on somebody your own size and fuck around; get kilt
But not like the kilt above the knees
BB will plant you niggas like seeds
Or fertilizer for the trees
Emergency vehicle last seen speeding from the scene
Nigga take one for the team; now he's bleeding from the spleen
Stay so fresh and oh so motherfucking clean
No blood splatter or evidence, long distance with a beam
We come in peace, while some of y'all niggas come in greed gluttons
Fucking up the game like ice, heroin, or speed
Slow down nigga
""Speed it up"" like ballad of Ricky Bobby, boy go fast
Not a hobby, this my life
You disrespect it, that's your ass
As one half of the outkast return like ghost of Christmas past
It's the son of Chico Dusty
Must be West Savannah bad
Had to go to church on Sundays with Great Grandma and Granddad
Taught me always follow Jesus when the grass didn't have a path
If I ever fell astray, then God will get me back on track
Didn't say that Rico, Ray, and Pat was gettin' with me and 3Stax
Then we spittin' cause killing everything that we attack
Special forces of the rap game so you best take heed of that
All the shit you rappers lack: we got plenty; here's a snack
Don't ruin their appetite because your shit is really whack
Whack ass nigga
This shit's like breathing to me
Born and bred for it
Another battle won
Another story to tell
Listen to the angelic plucking of the puppet strings
As Sir Lucious puts his left foot forward
And rides of into the horizon of infinite regression... victorious
Undefeated on the battle field against the means of ignorance, greed, and hatred
All contenders to the throne are left naked
Because the truth is the only thing you could never be stripped from
And if you commit to that truth, then you could end the vicious cycle
That's affecting our youth today...
If we just stop lying...
If we just stop lying...
Stop lying...
Lying..."

Equipped with a piece, case you niggas wanted beef
Cause man gave us laws and God gave us time
It's the art of storytelling and I'm only telling mine

It changes all the time
'Cause I've wondered how (I've wondered how)
I'm happier when I lose what I've needed all my life

Straight out of the belly of East Point, yeah that's my origins
Was born in West Savannah, Georgia then I was born again
Like the baby in the manger
I gave my life to Jesus because he could protect me from the dangers
In the circle of angels, just to help me shine my halo
Attended Sunday school but it felt like it was every day though
I didn't have a suit or no fancy shoes, we went in our play clothes
Received the word and it moulded me like Play Doh
We don't play though, we don't play though
They say we get lower than an alligator's navel
And when I say gator I mean that gator that match that sable, fur coat
I wish that PETA would throw some blood off on my fur, folk

She never spit it out either, we call her Poke-mouth
Big mouth bass, start to smash that ass
I build a bear before I build a bitch
I take her to the mall and fill her with the sugar dick
With the same lips give a nigga sugar whits
Give me brain, so intelligent with plenty sense
I took her innocence, yeah she was turnt out
And by the time I gave her back she was burnt out

The rhymes I designed are truly unrefined
Like diamonds with a spec of blood dug up out a mine
Flows flood between the ears right behind my eyes
Giving birth to lines, soul searching for the prize
I take my time when deciding what to write
Like the SAT while these other niggaz bite
Underated and mostly hated but got a lot of fight
Like a player, play the background, fuck the spotlight
Night night, I recite when I step up to this mic
Reputation trump tight like the husband want a wife
Stay sharp as broken glass, get busted on or smashed
When your ass cross paths with this half of the Kast
(Chorus One: B.o.B + (Big Boi))
It's bed time, bed time
Tuck yourself I can tell that you're terrified
Check my record you'll see that I'm verified
(Nobody want none) I terrorize
(Don't nobody want none) Now you're terrified
(Nobody want none of this here) It's bed time

Yeah this where second vers supposed to go
I don't think I need to hit y'all with another verse
But, I think I might, because I like to destroy shit

There's no time to retreat and no surrender
Been ready for battle General Patton's no beginner
I keep it all Madden, I call the play then execute for the W
Leave the rest of you destitute, now put that money up
Oh and your content is nonsense; How you expect to
Get it a little resitution with all this ghetto flaugin
Snow, that's for tobaggans, no won't be no pardons
Or bargains, three striked then you +Yank+ed up like +A. Rod+
And, uh, with no apartments, you got no home to run to
You snitching on yourself and no it's your front they come through
Without a tap on your phone
The only thing they had to do is listen to raps on your songs...
(Chorus Two: Joi + (Big Boi))
Lights out, the time for the nighty night's overude
This is the final countdown to your swan song, you are through
All wack emcees and posers this is going out to you
Fuck boys will drop their jaws and all because here something new

Top of the line pine, because I blow big, been here for a while

It would probably be straight if she was European
She's not she's hot and mad as she can be
If you can hate on anybody girl I'm glad it was me
She hates me, I know it I know'
She hates me, I know it for sure
But I'mma make her love me
I'mma make her love me again
She hates me, la la la
She hates me
I mean it started with the rose petal, ended with the stem
By the car, while I was thinking ""Damn here we go again""
We used to hold hands and had such a deep convo
Make a few plans like you wanna go where I'mma go?
Well let's leave pronto and that's what we did
Then we yelled out Geronimo and jumped off that bridge
Had a couple kids, you can move where I live
I know old ass niggas that's scared to do what I did
The shoe still fits but I'm wearing out the sole
Sometimes I really feel as if I'm burning out my soul
I should have a live band preparing for my show
But instead everybody keeps dick riding my flow
Now I know I ain't quite rich, but bitch I ain't broke
If she acting like a bitch, I guess we're around white folk
Forgive me if I raise my voice I won't raise a hand
But one thing I will do baby is raise my little man
She hates me, I know it I know'
She hates me, I know it for sure
But I'mma make her love me
I'mma make her love me again
She hates me, la la la
She hates me"

Like this cannabis that I'm blowing bust the package boy its cherry Kush
Uh stank ya smelly much
But this is the only hairy bush I would like to put my lips on
I like that pussy Brazilian waxed with the lips showin'
Tip toe in the high heels or her bare feet and she down for some major dick blowin'
How many licks does it take to get to the bottom of tootsie roll (Yup)
Pop goes the weasel when I explode in her mouth boy that's cold
'Er than Shaquille O'Neal from the free throw line
And I'm a peaceful person so she wanted to give me piece of mind
Now it appears that I am brain dead
My legs feel like Joe from Family Guy because she got insane head
Call me crazy but nowadays it seems like nothing is sacred
Oh well, I already got me somebody to play with

All the hoes say, (Gucci: hah hah hah)
Gucci up, here we go A-town, C-post
Cut masta swift down ya throat
Boy stop, Sir Luscious Left Foot's on fire
Trying to block my shine just ain't gone happen so don't try
Every time I get on this microphone I like to spit,
Inking hit up after hit
This penmanship is so legit
I came equipped like a prophylactic
Now they riding dicks, like
Stylin' on these suckas out here tryin' to buy they bitch
Now they rich try to piss everybody to trick off
But a true boss to pay the cost, she giving away her drawers,
Word to the brown James he some chicken chow mein,
Really man you done say some silly things
And the fella Dana Dane
Boy, you cuffin' claim to game
Hate my main thang, got my last name, ya know't I mayne?
I'm on my grind shawty,
Don't block my shine shawty.
Hold up, hold up guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up
I'm on my grind shawty,
Don't block my shine shawty.
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
Chill a little, sit a minute.
I can't close my safe no more,
'Cause I got too much money in it.
Gucci in the cell; did a deal, went to jail
I make music, I make movies, I'm in Tyler Perry's cell
I don't smell coming out the lam', fuck it what the hell
Gucci Mane, so I'm Guccied down; she got on Chanel
In the tent rolling stupid kush like I'm in the restroom
In the club with a half a pound (hundred fifty blunts)
Zone 6 - East Atlanta - don't fuck with Nia Long
Boy: shine like it's showtime, all my jewelry on
On the block with my stupid watch. Boy you need to stop!
When I stop, everybody watch the car don't have a top
In the streets. Cost a stupid check roll another pack
Now I'm gone, I can't even flip: Eastside where you at?
Can't be tripping 'bout no paper cause the safe is not so safe,
The piggy bank got legs and feet, and can't get up and walk away shawty,
With my southern drawl awkwardly I spray like the backside of a skunk in the stash house with the pump,
Pistol grip in my lap at all times in the 'lac from Atlanta to savannah can't a nigga stop that
Not when god's got his hands on me only the strong survive
And the weak, minded are falling by the wayside, they try.
But we shall overcome and succeed, indeed
But with disaster comes a great responsibility
We chose to lead not follow
It's a hard pill to swallow
Better get prescriptions filled cause there might not be tomorrow."

Cutmaster Swiff, down your throat
Boy stop!
(Verse One: Bun B)
Hot damn, ho (ho), here we go again (gain)
Raise up off of mines, put your elbow in
Slow your roll like your off-sets is off set
You out of line, 'cause you out off line, so you off net
Leather seats all wet, paint up on the Fleetwood
On this point, Jordans on my toes, did my feet good
Still got my Coogi, my shorty got a Gucci on
Flossing on the same track I hear Big and Gucci on
Now we remixed it like it's two different packs
Of Kool-Aid in the same jug, and I'm feeling same, thug
This is for the boys in blue, and the G's flamed up
I'm in the big body slab, raised up, game up!

I'm on my grind shawty, don't block my shine shawty
Hold up, hold up guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up

I still get if off with the soft and the hard
Now it's stacks that I stack for the sixteen bars
Used to dodge them laws in them stolen cars
Now I'm Escalade, sitting high with the stars
Took a shine like a star, now my head is in the clouds
And I'm papered, so I'm right back on the line
Project Pat, my dog, and I'm leading half a pound
Cousin house in the bay, on the North side of town
Man, the streets in me, so I can't say I don't miss em
Dipping through the hood plucking chicks, but I don't kiss em
She wishin that I would take her home; long stick her
Then I get her back, hit it from the back and I'm gone
(Verse Three: Big Boi)
Can't be tripping 'bout no paper cause the safe is not so safe,
The piggy bank got legs and feet, and can get up and walk away, shawty
With my southern drawl, awkwardly I spray
Like the backside of a skunk and the stash house with the pump
Pistol whip in my lap at all times in the 'Llac
From Atlanta to Savannah, can a nigga stop that?
Not when God's got his hands on me only the strong survive
And the weak minded are falling by the wayside

Sun is coming, it'll chase ya
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
The end is coming, I would race ya
But there's no running, it'll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down
What about the people that's barefoot
With no shoes for running when the sun come up?
Hey one percenters, the 99 say what you gonna do for us?
We'll run up in your house like the first runner up
Be the first one to buck and the last one to get laid down, stay down
And now we're looking at the top of the pile
Or the king of the mountain gonna knock him off
Revolt, but y'all niggas here too soft
Bubblegum, just popping off
At the mouth like the nigga got all the hoes
Got all the dough and all the women
Boy, what you gon' do in the penitentiary
Got a lot of money, can't take it with me
I can't take it with me, I wish they could send me
To the moon and back with a cure for cancer
And save the lives of my great grand-mama and my great gran-daddy
Now that's the answer to the question
But they make money of the medicine
Leaving us all stuck in elections
With no progressions, just recessions
Shoes for running, and I'll race ya
Sun is coming, it'll chase ya
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
The end is coming, I would race ya
But there's no running, it'll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down
Just as I expected, life gets deadly
It's funny how the beloved become the beheaded
The truth can be independent or the direction that you stretch it
So my niggas will draw when shit gets sketchy
That's a masterpiece, a work of art
A gallery, not photo-shop
Pictures say a million words, so I just let my photos talk
Even in your local talk, niggas say you know he boss
Every time my name is brought up better know it's mogul talk
That's why she give me geek till her shins weak
I'm blazing everyday, you can call that demp week
You're running from your life that you didn't see
That's like playing hide and seek with the Grim Reaper
Shoes for running, and I'll race ya
Sun is coming, it'll chase ya
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
The end is coming, I would race ya
But there's no running, it'll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down
You can run, but you can't hide
Spent your whole life trying to escape
When everybody stayed
Getting tired of living in a lie
Different nights, same town
Say goodbyes, but we tried
'Cause we know there's no getting out
And when the pawns are playing themselves
I just lay and wait and straighten myself
? To the rhythm sells out
Bring them back to life, give them mouth to mouth
Shoes for running, and I'll race ya
Sun is coming, it'll chase ya
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
The end is coming, I would race ya
But there's no running, it'll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down
You can fight and try to get away
But there's no way to run and hide to
You better know that there will come a day
Eventually it's gonna find you"

Boy check the resume, it's risky business in the A
And I been witness to this history, ever since the 10th grade
We went from rockin' braids to temp fades
I twist my A hat to the side just for style
Or throw on the Gucci bucket with the flowers, super fly
Wow, the southern pride been known to shut it down
It ain't so country though, nigga, this ain't no Gomer Pyle
I'm Sergeant Slaughter, I keep my shit cooked to order in order
To satisfy my people in Georgia and 'cross the water
And across the border the eses are gettin' smarter
They got flour for tortillas and lettuce for enchiladas
If you follow, wink wink, no doubt, we don't speak
In a blink those folks could have you sleeping in the clink
I'm shittin' on niggas and peein' on the seat
It's that nigga the B-I-G, B-O-I, O-U-T
Now party people in the club, it's time to cut a rug
And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs
I'm double fisted and you empty, you can grab a cup
Boy, stop, I'm just playin', let me dap you up
Baby, baby, you're in my system
Baby, baby, tell me you're listenin'
Why, it's after twelve, club like a hive be
A beehive cause now everybody buzzing around me
Could it be the way that the verse is sounding
Came up on the Geto Boys and the Underground Kingz
Toys, I had a Brougham, call it “Pretty Brown Thing”
Paint look like root beer when the sun was shining
Known to keep a bad bitch, no niggas beside me
Index finger on the trigger in case niggas is clowning
Not to flex but to protect my neck like the Wu-Tang
Self preservation is the rule when you do aim
Or get at something more sinister, you gotta be the finisher
Make it so the doctors, they can't replenish him
Or bring him back to life, back to reality
Go on, get him some hoes, leave it alone
Triple OG status, A-town's very own
Now party people in the club, it's time to cut a rug
And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs
I'm double fisted and you empty, you can grab a cup
Boy stop, I'm just playin', let me dap you up
Baby, baby, you're in my system
Baby, baby, tell me you're listenin'
Now this goes out to all my playas in the back
Sippin' 'ngac, bending round corners in the 'Lac
Cut a rug, playa now, cut a rug
Throw your deuces in the sky for the shutterbugg
(This goes out to all my ladies in the front)
What you want, you make me want to breed, girl, freeze
Cut a rug, cut a rug
(And throw your deuces in the sky for the shutterbugg)

(Chorus 1: ~Khujo Goodie, Big Boi~)
[K.G.:] She said her name was Tangerine, damn the American dream
She all about her fuckin' cream, so shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine - she shake it like a tambourine?
Shake it like a tambourine - she shake it like a tambourine
[B.B.:] She said her was Billie Jean, said she wanna show me things
I pulled out a stack of green, shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine - shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine - shake it like a tambourine
Now, let's set it straight, B-I-G don't cuff or cake
I, put her on a plate until she's no longer awake
They just lay, fast asleep, when I hit 'em with the snake
Put that venom up in 'em until I leave 'em with the shakes
On display, she's a model but she only model shoes
Not fake like a prosthetic leg or prostitute
How she choose? She just whispers in my ear (""I'm with you"")
I'm the type of dude that sends your baby mama out for food
And I also like her throat action, with a passion
Love in her mou-outh, for dental satisfaction
That means I hit the head like Greg Louganis then I'm splashin
Ughhh, bust one back of the 'llac, stabbin (hootie hoo!)
She know what's happenin', there's no reason to doubt it
If you ask her how I got it she say (""How he had went about it was"")
And then you wake up from a bad dream, a nightmare
Settle down 'cause she right there
(Chorus One)
(T.I.)
Okay, midnight, fit like, four or five chicks
In the drop '66 bumpin ""Southernplayalistic""
As we ridin' through the city lights, Monday Magic City night
Pass these around, momentarily they feelin' like
Gettin' right, good girls, got 'em gettin' busy like
Big dykes, eatin so much pussy they forget pipe
All got boyfriends, tell me they don't hit it right
They come see me so they can come be freaks
In the back seat, everything's fast like a track meet
All I can see is titties, pussy lips and ass cheeks
Actually, no exaggeration, no imaginin
Real talk, my reality is yo' fantasy
Keisha, Kim, Tamika, Shay, Alicia and Gloria
Chasin this broad tryin' to find euphoria
Name notorious, dick game glorious
Find me shawty when ya boyfriend borin ya
(Chorus Two: Big Boi, Khujo Goodie)
[B.B.] Shake it like some Texas Pete droppin' on your collard greens
Make it hotter when she want a dollar, do you follow me?
Shake it like a tambourine - shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine - shake it like a tambourine
[K.G.] Smellin like some tangerines, rollin' like she on some beans
Garter belt full of greens, booty bustin' out the seams
Shake it like a tambourine - she shake it like a tambourine
Shake it like a tambourine - watch her shake it like a tambourine
(Big Boi)
Once upon a rhyme I knew this girl and she was fine
As everything outdo's, the kind of girl I describe her like-like-like
Michael Jordan when he's froze in a pose of a Jumpman
Top flight security on these hoes man
She drop it low only for me to pick her up
When she's liquored up I'm leavin' my fingerprints on her butt
A ten-hut, at attention as we stand for this woman
General Patton, boy stop, we think she cummin
Lovin' the way that I'm dickin her down, Boi you bluffin
Nothin' but a nigga like me be straight up royal flushin
But this ain't 'bout playin' no cards dummy
Her give me open mouth sugar and she go hard for me
Even take a charge for me, if the coppers caught us ridin'
To get a tray of fruit, and a pack of 1-point-5's and
I'm all the way on them papers, she all the way on my team
We burn it down like California trees in the breeze
Fire!

Shake shake it, shake shake it, shake shake it, shake shake it
Shake shake it, shake shake that ass
Shake shake it, shake shake it, shake shake it, shake shake it

I'm truly one of the baddest motherfuckers to ever do it
Done did it, gone do it again, and can't nobody stop me
'Cause I occupy these streets while these niggas they rhyme bout shopping
Been a handsome ass nigga since my mama wiped my bottom
Kept a plethora of pussy on deck before the money
Or monies, greens, bills, dividends and such
Operation grind and stack cause these rappers are out of touch
Or like a rabbit that just lost one foot to a key chain, out of luck
My tail is never tucked, so fuck niggas beware when ya buck
Let's be clear, I'mma keep it straight up player like a gentleman
But I won't go back and forth, east, west, south, north, ha!
When my feet touch the ground
When I peep all around
And I'm feeling all loved
Yeah, I'm feeling all loved
From the way that you stared
For the joy of that I'm there
And I'm feeling all loved
Yeah, I'm feeling all loved
Yeah, it seems just like yesterday, where did the time go
I'm giving you the best that I got, Anita Baker rhyme flow
It's time for that new, new shit that y'all been dying for
Divine flows, the radio got y'all like zombies
Come alive, hoes, like a litter full of puppies
Or a baby with a onesie on, your old lady clumsy, holmes
That means she's falling for Daddy Fat Sax, wanna show me some
Sweeter than some honeycombs, she wanna be the queen bee
The numero uno sitting on her throne next to me but ain't gotta be easy
Why I got a seat for her, right in my naked lap
Reverse cowgirl, she ride it then make her booty clap
I'm breached birth, feet first, nigga with each verse
Been ten toes down to those familiar with the sound
So Shazam me and then you Google Dungeon Family
And when you do you will understand I'm buku outta my noodle
With this pad and pen, and boy you penciled in
You're temporary, substitute and we can't fit you in, let's begin
When my feet touch the ground
When I peep all around
And I'm feeling all loved
Yeah, I'm feeling all loved
From the way that you stared
For the joy of that I'm there

Yeah, I'm feeling all loved"

We go through this everyday
Adding more to the story
Trying to make it interesting
Lying to yourself like it really happened
It's like we're riding on a never ending traaiiin
Pick a stop (pick a stop), pick a lie (pick a lie)
Pick a reason to convince 'em that it never happened
I think we'll have to save the day
(Verse One: Big Boi)
But not like Captain Save
More like black Captain Kirk, because Big Boi's from some other place
Oh way deep in outer space where the freaks are not afraid
To crank that bitch in the moonlight while nobody's getting paid
Galaxies of slaves, enter Dungeon Family
With Outkast, Goodie Mob, & P.A. now were +Gnarly+ like +Barkley+
Without Harley Davidson, maybe someday you will see
Boy, we been done gave you some, the pipe has already been laid,
Foundation sturdy as ankle weights or shoe of cement
Be ready to soprout them wings or choose to cruise like a fish
We wish, but we need to pray, we don't stray away from this
Kids, common sense ain't common when your minds trapped in a fence
But mines is intense, hence the way that I spit my shit
'Cause I'm fire breathing (fire breathing) dragon in this biiitch
Which is a girl dog, yet a pitfall
For me and y'all, songs found no bombs, but the ones rock
It's all wrong
(Verse Two: Big Boi)
Look up, up and I pray
Channeling that heavenly energy, There's plenty we can say
But the enemy is winning because your punk ass be afraid
But I spray what's on my mind to educate and entertain
KRS, he said it best I learned from listening to these tapes
Before I-iTunes came out and made CDs obsolete
For Reality TV would seem to be that big mistake
And now Big Brother's got these cameras deep in each and every state
While each rapper claims to be the heavyweight
'Cause he mentions cocainia in bout everything he makke
And thet why them people try to pin him with that case
Cause his blow his dixie crystal pistol play was just for play, fake
Just for play play... but got them baybays
Beliving that bullshit
Just for play play... but got them baybays
Fucked up!

Sometimes I think I love it (Sometimes I think I love it)
And I think it loves me toooooo

Sometimes Ithink I hate it (Sometimes I think I hate)

I like a J{?} when you say hit the crack hard
Her doggy-style pulled the black card?
No way we ain't tryin' to take it that far
But you a star, and I'ma let you shine
I see all the signs when you showed the full moon from behind
Closed do's, come out them under-clothes
Shawty I chose you and not them other hoes
A toast I propose to all those
Who know the G-code and got they very own
Sha'mon!

How do I even begin? Shit, I'm him
The B-I to the G, B-O-I, no hyphen
And then be puttin' that icing on your cake
Like lightning strikes in the same place - not me
I tell 'em hurry up and waaaave
Like a jailhouse getaway driver with his foot on the braaaake
Dyin' to accelerate
And tryin' to get hitched, bitch I'm tryin' to celebrate
Confiscate digits
Then vacate the premises, this is not the way we finish this
This is just the genesis
With the most winningest player on the team but no tennis's
I been a member since
I turned the age of innocence and if you behave then
Sha'mon!

No matter where you are I hear yo' song
And I'm comin' to scoop

Ain't near when you niggas can't even come close
Simple fat sacks
Been a serial killer, oh nice to meet you, best believe that
Like Ripley's boy, don't tempt me
I fuck around and leave your kool-aid glass half empty
Your time is running, I'm just like the sand in it
Been jammin' in half and half of you niggas know you can't get it
That's right, it as in IT
We like the apple on your iPhone, niggas always biting
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free falling, Thom Pettie
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free falling, we up all night
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon
(Motel, hotel)
Motel, hotel
Intercontinental, all cause a nigga push a pencil
That's an S550, not a rental
Bitch, I don't even ride Lincoln Continentals
In the rear seat is a fat black nigga with a smile like Denzel
Pretty model bitch with me moving bout as graceful as a gazelle
Skinny as a pencil, fold her like a pretzel
Hit her with the XL
Just in case this funky ass bitch was doing Intel
I'mma give her news she can go tell
Snitchin' ass bitches get evicted, no bus fare
Grown ass women ride a Bentley that's so clear
I'm so player, SpottieOttieDopaliscious
Mama phony but I swear to God the pussy dope and she delicious
One time for my wife and my mistress, gone
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free falling, Thom Pettie
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free falling, we up all night
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon"
43,Tremendous Damage,2012,Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors (2012),Hip Hop,Big Boi,"Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearing up my sober
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People telling me be strong like a soldier
But I suffer tremendous damage
Just make it fade away
Just let it fade away
Just make it fade away
I suffer tremendous damage
So many things that I didn't know
But still I've seen my dreams come true
And now the little kids are watching my videos
And telling me ""I wanna be you""
See, I'm just a man so I ain't scared to fall down
No matter what ever I go through
I told the man in the mirror keep pushing on
But I can't say the same about you
Nah nah, nah, I done made it this far
And ain't no way I'm gonna turn back
I started out with no car
And graduated to a Cadillac
But all that money don't mean a got damn thing to me
'Cause we don't worship that
But like the Wright brothers, you gotta crash and burn
Before you take flight, I know ya heard that
Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearing up my sober
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People telling me be strong like a soldier
But I suffer tremendous damage
Just make it fade away
Just let it fade away
Just make it fade away
I suffer tremendous damage
February 28th, the day my daddy died
Well, not really, his energy passed to the other side
And ever since that day I've seen him fade away with my own eyes
I never doubted God, the Marine corps they say semper fi
My daddy fought in Vietnam
This is a fun fact for the bloodline of Antwan Andre
Just like this song say
I've suffered tremendous damage, got me tougher than a motherfucker
And since the days of Player's Ball
Y'all thought it was about all these broads and slamming Cadillac doors
Now your American idol is just a fraud
You kiss a man he's still gonna be a frog (ribbit)
A bitter old negro not at all
See, I look 26 and still hit your broad
Still pitch a ball, hike, pass, shoot, kick and all
Practice make perfect and first it was Bamboo now it's Cross
Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearing up my sober
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People telling me be strong like a soldier
But I suffer tremendous damage
Just make it fade away
Just let it fade away
Just make it fade away
I suffer tremendous damage"
44,Turns Me On,2010,Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty (2010),Hip Hop,Big Boi,"Niggas don't fuck with a nigga like me
Cause a nigga like me don't fuck around
Niggas don't fuck with a nigga like me
Cause a nigga like me don't fuck around
Rump bump-it, (repeat 14)
I know you see that
No one's competing
Ooh that turns me on
Ooh that turns me on
What turns me on about ya, I doubt you have a clue,
Sassy attitude, and red bottom shoes
Got I'm mad at you
I do think you're fierce and that you
Killing them of course
With the features of an angel
And the bottom of a horse
Thoroughbred, thorough head
Makes ya moist like the dark fudge
Brownie with the nut of your choice
Soaking wet, all the feathers in the goose
Down, who's loose now
You done let the juice ooze down
Do smile, when you do it's on some ooh child
Kiss ya in the mouth, juicy fruit, make it cool down
And make it truth, ain't it true now
Divine neck, the respect it ain't shit for me to prove gal
You need some time, press the snooze down
I don't mind 'cause I'm as hard as all the iron in all the tool house
Or tool shed, go and play it like
When alarm sound off around two is up ahead
I know you see that (It ain't going down without cha)
No one's competed
Ooh that turns me on
Ooh that turns me on
Who gives a damn about the past
I live for the day, plan for the future, pack a lunch, and haul ass
Anyway, it ain't no time for no picnics,
This that business, the slickness to get your chick hit quick
I make her drip all her liquids
Then get butt booty naked when I spit on some pimp shit
Make her legs shake so she never loses interest
Calling out my name when I'm asking, ""whose is this? ""
Naw, it's not a game, ass falling out the frame
With the Polaroid camera I have to take two flicks
She can't avoid all the stamina, we do this
With no steroids or other artificial juices.
Therefore, she knows the undisputed truth
When I slip into this boo while I slide into this booth
I'm kicking it with you, lot like martial artists do
We can break boards, and you can kick rocks
I know you see that (it ain't going down without cha)
No one's competed
Ooh that turns me on
Ooh that turns me on
Sit yourself down on my big old bed
Turn your body round here let me give you some-
Don't you want to make a freaky memory with me
So later on you can think about it then you'll be like
Damn...
That turns me on
I know you see that (It ain't going down without 'cha)
No one's competed
Ooh that turns me on
Ooh that turns me on
From the back
Now from the front"
45,You Ain't No DJ,2010,Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty (2010),Hip Hop,Big Boi,"(Big Boi)
Boy stop, you ain't no DJ... [*echoes*]
(""Greetings..."")
I double dare, matter of fact nigga I double dog dare
Any rapper that take it there with this playa here
Let's be clear, I'm a leader not your peer
Valedictorian of this rap shit every year (year year year)
Like beer and pretzels with the game I go good
I'm the Hansel to your Gretel, you's a dame, understood
Overstand hoe ass nigga from my hood, I'm embarrassed
By the lack of class, sat in the back of class
But passed with flying colors with yo' backwards ass, you're like the caboose
And I'm the engine locomotive to let loose steam in the booth, scream ah WOOF!
Dream Team, nigga fuck that pillow talk, keep sleeping
While I'm beating down yo' street up in that green thing
Greetings Earthlings, I've been lurking deep in the shadows
Gathering artillery for the battle
Now, on the front line I stand, microphone in my right hand
Left foot on the gas, don't make me put my foot in yo' ass
(Chorus 2X: Big Boi)
Yo' DJ ain't no DJ, he just make them fuckin' mixtapes
Where they at? [*repeat 7X*]
Yo' DJ ain't no DJ, he just hit that instant replay
There they go [*repeat 7X*] - go
(Yelawolf)
Yeah, my momma gave birth to a 10-pound, 6-ounce dream
(Dream dream dream dream dream)
And God said, look for the burnin bush, now I turned to weed
So I jumped in my shell when I saw my momma burnin trees (hey)
Hard white, I, trickle nickel bags
Ice cold true shit; in the booth with blue lips
On your grave like a tulip, in the bar like a pool stick
8-0-8 Toomp shit, Magic Mike, poof bitch!
Ain't nowhere to rest, nowhere for you to sit
I stole your couch and I took your truck to move it with
Sofa, any one of you wanna get to' up?
I'm a tattoo, Kodak you, close up
Ain't no UFO, no, Yela's a supernova (WOOF!)
Dogs are barkin as soon as that trooper roll up (WOOF!)
30 at 6, momma don't gotta load up
'Cause I'm from the varsity of maybe hardly and RC Cola
Hold up!
(Yelawolf)
Yeah, and, I
Party in poverty with people like, ""Yeah you're famous, so what?""
I bet you can't hitch that semi up to this tow truck
Rich with a hundred dollars, soul like a batch of collards
Yeah I'm pale but I'll impale you with an Impala
Roll with pimp scholars, +ATLiens+
A-L-A-B-A-M-A against, come and check my weight again
Baby I know I ain't that crazy, the scale says heavy
Must be my dick the way bitches been hangin' on it lately
(Big Boi)
(Yeah, we stay) bangin' on the daily, soul funk crusader maybe
Tailored alligator souffl?, Escalade all in yo' ladies
Space invader, I'm the lyrical Darth Vader
Give thanks pussy nigga I don't expose you as a hater
Got Decatur, East Point, College Park and the SWAT's
Campbellton Road closed, road block, watch out for the cops
Gotta think outside the box, know how to connect the dots
'Fore somebody hit the jackpot playin' in ya slot, boy stop
(Big Boi)
Where they at? [*repeat 8X*]
There they go [*repeat 7X*] - go
Where they at? [*repeat 7X*]
There they go [*repeat as it fades out*]"
