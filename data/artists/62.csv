Even when I'm in my dreams, I'm high off self esteem
Blowin' on that Jamaica my niggas love the team, marijuana fiend
Keep your Black N Milds and cigs 'cause me no nicotine
I keep my pimpin' mean
Me and Musa as we pulled up on them sixes just to go and bust some bitches
See them motherfuckin' wheels, sex appeal
And if I'm in the backseat with them tints, that Glock concealed
They eye us as we peel like the, orange hat that I be stylin' in
Like a zanny or a klonopin
All your swishers, they be model thin
We plus size, nigga!
Like Tocarra and them, shining like a halogen
So bright, like highbeams, headlights and midnight
That one of Rhode Island's watchtower sights
Yeah, the world is all I need
But if you don't know anything just know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
You don't know anything? Just know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Ain't got no money mayne, but bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Let's go chill up on my balcony and feel the breeze
Open up a corona and see who got some weed
If we don't have no trees then let's gather up the fees
Hundred dollars, that's a seventh of the sour D
Make a order it'll be here a quarter to three
Smoke it till we on E
Then we fill up again with another 10
Then we just go run back to the cheese to fill our, family needs
No a rease, smoke one for our G's that ran with a strike of 3's
We dyin' up in every plea
So for y'all my niggas swear to god my heart will bleed
Kick the shit for my lifers and ones who kickin' seas
Even if it's just 5 dollars keep your brain on free
Elevate your mind 'cause in due time you wine and dine
Something fine in that
Kush blunts soon be your valentine and my shit be Columbine
My friends is all I need
But If you don't know anything just know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
You don't know anything? Just know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Ain't got no money mayne, but bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
Who got some weed?"

3,Birds & tHe Beez,2011,Setbacks (2011),Hip Hop,Schoolboy Q,"Straight to the block, to the hood, to a spot
Cocaine to a rock, duece duece in a sock
Every dollar closer to a drop
Every drop is closer to a cop
Every cop is closer to a cell
Hit the cell your ticket right to hell
No job, no bail
No fam, no mail
Institution another nigga fail
Go from pussy to a prison tale
Fuck that, I quit while I'm ahead
Ship my music off with them instead
Turn it up and here the ghetto pledge
Live righteous nigga like my brother said
King Tut, Martin Luther, Malcolm X, but ima shoota'
Top ramen, knowledge for the noodle
Finally gettin' praised
Yeah kudos
Doing bad, still love the need
Connect said it's something up his sleeve
Said, I rather bust off them keys
Yeah nigga birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Wanna do a song, but its hard to carry on
And my daughter hungry sitting home
And my girl said she feeling lone
I can't tell it's over in her tone
Only time I call is for a loan
She be stressing, so depressing
Always worried every time a lil nigga gone
Stay strong for the future, stick together, yeah shoot ya'
Get a couple wipps, yeah kunta
Schoolboy but gangsta was his tutors
Say money be the root of evil, look around and see what it do to people
Veins full of heroin using pcp inject the body with a needle
Lord help us, swear to god, dope dealers, get a job
Keep it real this shit ain't really cool, being in a cell, you ain't alive
Niggas turn to shark over cheese, love to help the devil do a deed
So I rather bust of them keys, yeah nigga birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change
Q I wanna see you do your thang
Entertainment business living lime light
Hop on every track and move them trains
Show these motherfuckers that you been tight, then they ever been
Its evident that you intelligent but you can't escape that life
And for you my nigga I would sacrifice my self to make it just to see you hold the mic
And hit the stage and rock the set but its hard to change when your from the set
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death, like a cracker would like to hang you by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them run way jets
Fly to Singapore one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to god, its hard out here for a young black men to live
If you don't do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
My nigga won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter
Please don't let her grow up life without a father
Look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy
All she need is love but that shit aside
At the same time know they got to eat, know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HTC, no a.c
And the block hot, you keep runnin', cop say freeze
Blue pill, red bill, choose now, birds or the beez
Birds or the beez
Birds or the beez
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane

Count my change

4,Black THougHts,2016,Blank Face LP (2016),Hip Hop,Schoolboy Q,"Our experience to where we have parents in our lives that were showing us everything, like didn't nobody walk us, our hand and show love like you do this and don't do that. It wasn't like that coming up in our mothafuckin' community. We grew up off of cigarillos... we grew up off of second row, acting like them. A worldwide blade, a real strength...
Yeah that's on the regular
Smokin' the gas on the regular, man
Word
Sippin' on Hen, that's the regular
Pissy sofas, sharin' food with roaches, uh
I'm gangsta, Crip, my poppa was a bitch
Left me where hope just don't exist
And every neighbor got a fence
With bars on windows, my mom's slavin' for the rent
Throwin' dices, GT dyno pool
Where you hang, we shootin'
You slip, we stiffin'
Creative Crippin', uh
Bitches stoppin' traffic
This the type of shit that make the MAC a classic
Reason I'm a pussy magnet
She learned to carry package
Been the best at rappin', uh
I'm hot as Vegas
Your favorite rapper broke, he don't get this paper
But claim he got a kilo, been born in '93 though
He tryna fool the people
Man
The joke's on you, mothafucka
The loc is on you, mothafucka
I warned you, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Ain't nothin' changed but the change
Let's put our brains away from gangs
Crips and Bloods the old and new slaves
Shit we even changed our names
Tiny somethin' Lil Shane while we bang
But yo, y'all ain't hearin' me
My homie facin' life, told me that my pride my biggest enemy
But... you keep your eyes in that dark
Your mind, it greys your heart
I wrote these rhymes days apart
Most of us caught before we can expand our thoughts
How your grandmother see your corpse?
How your big homie make your life a book?
Left you for dead 'cause he ain't lead you, right
But I'm gon' fredom write
Let's put the rags down and raise our kids
Let's put the guns down and blaze a spliff
Let's do it now, ain't no buts or ifs
It took a Blood to get me Pringle chips
You can learn to fly or take the ladder
Real nigga shit, all lives matter, both sides
Man
The joke's on you, mothafucka
The loc is on you, mothafucka
I warned you, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma

Blank faces
Smokers and dope fiends, hookers and playas
Dope in the vein, young and servin' the meds
Run from the police, jump from the ledge
Be what you wanna be as long as you get the money right, yeah
Niggas don't understand until you leap over 25
Dancin' with devils, never knew how to treat your woman right, yeah
Feet on the pedal runnin' over jokers and funny tops
Word to my OG, he gone, that nigga fresh out of strikes
I should know better, Heaven knows that I ain't the dummy type, nah
I should be flyin' home without a care
My baby don't want no toys, she want me there
I trade the noise for a piece of divine
I savor my coins for a piece of the land, ah
Something to pass while I'm passin' my prime
My word in the cards, full deckk in my hand
As sure as the smog is pollutin' the land
Be what you wanna be as long as you get the money right, yeah
Uh... wise as my Chevy
My life's so fucked up the drank don't get me buzzed
We ain't blood and they killed my 'cause
Chuckin' Cs since I was a cub
Young nigga grew up on hate but where's the love?
Ash and dubs on
Niggas don't understand until you leap over 25
Dancin' with devils
Guess you would say I'm one of the lucky type
No!
Fuck you thought?
Playin' tooth fairy, Santa before I'm buried
Easter egg Huntin', pickin' seeds out the pumpkin
Six years straight the valentine for my munchkin
I made a queen outta nothin'
Told me stay in school, my dream was just a small percentage
Said a million wasn't realistic
Last year I spent it, what's the laws of physics?
Move pounds or move down to Section 8 livin'
Grew up around Crippin', Woo business
And if I never make it to 25 I swear to God I'm still gon' fly, nigga
But it's still my time, nigga
Tell me who gon' fly with me?
Yeah!
Who gon' ride with ya?
Who gon' fly with ya?
It's still my time, yeah

Livin' out his backpack every night needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga!
Ones for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready 'cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that motherfucker to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate dawg
I was hangin' on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dawg
Know what I'm sayin'?
Nigga prayin' up to God just hopin' that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for
Load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time steppin' in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray
Just wanna say
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see, my nigga just lost his son while I'm here huggin' on my daughter
I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinkin' of some bullshit to tell him, like
""It'll be okay. You'll be straight, it'll be aight.""
Well, fuck that shit, whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or puttin' in work, fuck it, then I'm ridin'!
You know wassup, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved that I'd be a fuckin' fool
To be livin' by the street rules
Fuck police tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith, stay strong brah
Remain' solid brah
Keep playin' ball 'cause it's the only way up out it, brah
A nigga proud of ya'
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed, I'll have whatever he needs
We the last of a dyin' breed, live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come, but most, I'm sorry for your son
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere
And I'mma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everwhere
But I'mma always be right here
Livin' in a premature place - wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates - break
Every time a bullet detonate - dates
Of obituary carry crates of a scary picture
With a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinnin' you was hearin' angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, comin' from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't (blessed my nigga)
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed
Take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas, that neglect, your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step, step my nigga
One, two, skip, skip
Back, back, look both ways
Pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dawg
It ain't nothin' but a bunch of fuck niggas dawg
In a minute everybody gon' be winnin'
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga

Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga
We all blessed my nigga"
7,Blind Threats,2014,Oxymoron (2014),Hip Hop,Schoolboy Q,"Right, uh, same shit every day, homie
Lord please forgive me for all my sins
Yeah, nigga wake up to the same shit everyday, homie
Walking in the valley of the shadow of death
No rules, right
Washing my sins off in hell's water
Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em
Kneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me?
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way
Uh, four corners, cat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch
High on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet
Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more
Trapping trying to make it out this obstacle
Life on the edge, hell a block away
Pretty Snow White turned eight today
Selling that base, no Dr. Dre
Uh, guess who in the building?
Bucket hat with a strap like a pilgrim
Uh, kneeling down with some questions to address like
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?
The 10 commandments, I can mark five checks
But I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats
Streets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex
Faith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet
Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests from the cop raid
All can relate, from the streets to the wall from niggas to compadres
When the sun go down, I'm predictin' a heatwave, forecast your whole body
Heat on, room full of homi's, I just pray that the Lord got me
But if God don't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way
Mic check (La-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low)
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way
Aim that, shoot that, pledge allegiance
Kill mine, kill yours, make it even
Soul need saving, Mr. Preacher
I know I only come around when it's Easter
Funerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time
When I'm in jail or when my card declined
Uh, will you answer me?
Take me out of Hell and make plans for me?
Misery loves company, ain't a surprise
It was just me and my niggas, we was trying to survive
But we would never make it out alive
We living to die, oxymoron
Hope to get to heaven till that day arrive
Running through the ally, hope the bullet don't collide
Car window shattered, glass on my right side
Dogs bark in the backyard, root for me
Out of shape belly, courtesy of 40
Spoiled only child, baby boy Jody
Same jacket on from back in the day
Praying that the Lord come and take me away
But if God don't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way
Mic check (La-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low)
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way
It go tuna fish sandwiches bread, dry snaking
Black Lincoln, burgundy Mac, I clap a king-pin
Caught me in the airport gust that I was thinkin'
On how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances
Yeah, money is the issue, I diss you
It's no problem at all, yo, the bunch on the pistol
'Cause I'm a suit case king
Cooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin
No wage bet, we stay winning, play it again, yo
Put the bone in your jaw, now say it again
Round knife, fork, under the tents, coming to rents
Get out the way or let the shotty dispense
Revenge killers who make the events iller
This is more realer, snatch you right up out of the Benz
The Wu wheelers who huddle up, coupes knows the truth
You know the woopty-woop, solo or group I kill niggas"

Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
GetMine my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines, drive-by's at bedtime
Get down, I earn mine, so one loss they can't sign
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay
So now we 'bout to break the bank, money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like la-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do

My time to show out, finally the illest Crip
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rap
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel

Fuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills
Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal
Love how I'm doing, long way from grooving
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day
I let y'all fucks parlay, you wonder why I'm straight
New shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row
Bow down her tempo, I don't know her info
Threw up my peace sign, go rare with mignon
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay
So now we 'bout to break the bank, money be on my mind

12,Cycle,2011,Setbacks (2011),Hip Hop,Schoolboy Q,"Hold and shoot till he drop
We'll be waiting for you around the corner, nigga
Only twelve and a half, and already ducking them jabs
Fighting back, just hoping that he last, he on his ass
Huffing and puffing, getting tagged
See what this nigga feel would only make them niggas laugh
He felt the discomfort, didn't trust him right away
Saw the Devil in they eyes, his homie looking straight
But something was different in him, not the same from yesterday
Shit, his whole demeanor changed, even his smile was strange, his childhood never came
But dude was always gutter, he got it from his brother
From his brother, from his brother, brought pain onto his mother
Once was elementary homies, but now we attack each other
Shit, set love aside, tuck his pride, shit, he had to ride
Threw on his hood and then he fired, fired and fired
Fired and fired, the tires screech
Spirit up out of reach
A young nigga swallowing yeast, trapped in the belly of the beast, sheesh
I know niggas that kill niggas, that kill niggas
That kill niggas, that kill niggas
The cycle continues
The cycle continues (kill nigga, kill nigga)
I know niggas that kill niggas, that kill niggas
That kill niggas, that kill niggas
The cycle continues
The cycle continues (kill nigga, kill nigga)
He only seventeen, his homies was his motive
He only seventeen, his mama never noticed
Too busy paying bills, tryna provide a meal
Pay the rent and steal, her child live for a thrill
Fulfill his niggas' wishes, no more hugs or kisses
No more 'how you been?', no more tucking in
He with them other men, poppa never came
So his cousin then would pretend, imitating if they was him
Got the pistol on him loaded, loaded off of gin
Feels like niggas on him, so he look for them
First nigga wrong, hack! Blam blam to him
Paranoia kills, kill or be killed
Let alone all them thugs, let alone all them drugs
Treat is kinda like a bud, let's see how karma does
Let's see how much he loves shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, bam, bam
I know niggas that kill niggas, that kill niggas
That kill niggas, that kill niggas
The cycle continues
The cycle continues (kill nigga, kill nigga)
I know niggas that kill niggas, that kill niggas
That kill niggas, that kill niggas
The cycle continues
The cycle continues (kill nigga, kill nigga)
This nigga twenty-one, he feel like he the man
This nigga twenty-one, his mom said be a man
Love to sag his pants, pistol in his hand
Feel he too advanced, him slipping out his chance
Think he at his best, he hit the set, he making orders
Got them lil' niggas busting shots and flipping quarters
An ounce a half, double up, shit, what you order?
Even dimes think with a corrupted mind
Adapted to the crime, living with regrets
In order to survive gotta get high
Cautious with time, paranoia all through his body
Trying love for a hobby, you know gangsters come with kids
Teaching them wasn't his
EBT, the corner store, he go to fill up the fridge
Approached by a little nigga, hoodie over his lid
Looked down the barrel of a burner tucked, aimed at his wig
Let him fire, then he fired, fired
I know niggas that kill niggas, that kill niggas
That kill niggas, that kill niggas
The cycle continues
The cycle continues (kill nigga, kill nigga)
I know niggas that kill niggas, that kill niggas
That kill niggas, that kill niggas
The cycle continues
The cycle continues (kill nigga, kill nigga)"

Camping out, your daddy selling money he can understand
Drizzle riding through the hood, junkies love the Avalanche

27,Hoover Street,2014,Oxymoron (2014),Hip Hop,Schoolboy Q,"I got that work, fuck Labor Day, just bought a gun
Fuck punching in, throwing rocks, no hopscotch
Bet my 9 milli hit the right spot
Bang... Last night it was a dream
This morning a fantasy back
When the only fan I had was a fiend
Meet me by the Acura cause the cops like
To get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea
But it's cool I've been catching on to they formula
See I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'
Then rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo
The bad guy never once been a hoes hero
He get zero, I said nada
Bitch pass the cama (Uh, yeah)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?
I'm a product of a real nigga
La-la-la familia, real nigga
Get confronted by a real nigga
Fuck with one of my real niggas
It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?
It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball

It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?
I done jumped off my ass, hit the lick and barely pass
But I quickly got to to ballin
2012 ain't really happen, so I guess it's back to trapping
Eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal, my uncle stole my stereo
My grandma can't control him
But... uh, uh
Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But... uh, uh
Click-clack, pow-pow-pow, boom, nigga
But... uh, uh
Meet Glock clock familia
Find a nigga realer than me, my socks stink
Eat so much pussy that my mustache pink
Strapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt
Gangsta lean help, hoodie on backwards with the eyes cut out
My hate felt, my.45 elder, poetry's deep
I never fail ya, Schoolboy bust flame
Orange-yellow, higher than Margiela's
Since a young nigga I admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal
From his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout
Think about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday he still get a hit
Whether jacking radio's or sucking dick
Sell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips
'Cause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much
To get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work
Now let's re-rewind it, answer my church
Times getting harder than my dick on a growth spurt
Around the same time all you niggas was on purp
My sober ass was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck freeze
Give me the keys, extra Frito's, chili and cheese
Threw some Baby Lucas in his eyes before I leave
The cops'll never get the leak, grandma taught me well
And my uncle gun was the accessory, 211 sipping plus a robbery
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome
I done jumped off my ass, hit the lick and barely pass
But I quickly got to to ballin
2012 ain't really happen, so I guess it's back to trapping

Meet Glock clock familia
Grandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more
She always got me things that we couldn't afford
The new J's and Tommy Hill in my drawers
Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, Golden Eye was away at war
We wasn't thinking of getting money then
Nor did I wonder why my uncle done sold his Benz
'Cause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down
I also notice moms be locking doors when he around
But anyways, he wife done left him and now he living with us
My bike is missing, grandma light a hotter chick every month
My uncle's nuts, he used to give me Whisky to piss in cups
Knocking on the door telling me to hurry up, he in a rush
I gave it to him then got my ass whipped for doing it
Moms used to tell me like ""nigga, know who you dealing with""
Them was the good days till I was raised the older ways
Rat-Tone my niggas' brother showed me my first K
I was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back, he called us over like ""Hey""
Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk! We like ""Damn, nigga""
Then again, yawk, yawk! We like ""Damn, nigga""
Hearing him say cause turned us to a fan, nigga
Later on he got locked so know we're taking his fades
Continue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page
Gangbanging was a ritual and grandma would help
She should've never left her gun on the shelf
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome
I done jumped off my ass, hit the lick and barely pass
But I quickly got to to ballin'

29,I'm Good,2011,Setbacks (2011),Hip Hop,Schoolboy Q,"As a younger age, never really gave a shit
Just my grandma arms, kept me out of harm
Nigga went to class, my football pads
Kept the burner stashed, they ain't gon' catch my ass
In the Pontiac with the bad speakers
Back then? Shit, I was into sneakers
And fitted caps, side kicks
My same bitch, she a down bitch
Had a little daughter, glad it ain't a boy
Knew she'd bring me joy, so I named her Joy
Kiss her on her head, then I kiss her lips
Then I kiss her cheek, lay her down to sleep
Trials and tribulations helped me through my situations
Little observations stopped the cops from confrontations
And the ghetto bird, and a nigga snitched
But I'm still dipping, shit, I ain't tripping
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...

But I'll still make a decision that make my life still worth it, yeah-ea-eah
And sometimes it may hurt
But I know what you see ain't what it's gon' be, 'cause I know my worth, yeah...)
Got a lil' older, nigga seen a lot of shit
Been out in Boston, even got to see the Knicks
I've been to Dallas, slap a five with the bench
Back to the hood where niggas betting on the six
But shit is crazy
Lil' Teisha and Tamika bout to kill they babies
Pregnant at the same time, and they think that shit is cute
Always running from the truth, bigger dream they must pursue
And they babies wasn't in it
Just going bout they business in the club
She off of Guinness, adioses with the lemon
V.I.P. she dreams of, in the club looking for mean buzz
In a dress looking distinctive
Ass hanging, got that ass hanging with the biggest baller in the club
Ain't got a dub, but she want some love
Wasn't polite, but she feel it's right (feel it's right)
Lay it down, then he dimmed the lights, played it right for the night

Uh, ignorance is bliss, but to know is pain
No matter what we reap, we still sow the same
The concept of change is second-rate to change
Either way around, the cycle still remains
Out my project window, observing the wannabes blowing endo
Shooting dice on the corner, big homie roll up with his kinfolk
Unfold a stack on 'em like, what they hitting for?
Slamming the doors on his Benzo
He left the engine running, bumping something sounding like
Late eighties R&B, trunk full of China white
Type of nigga ladies like, known dope dealer
Money, cash, hoes getter, slash stone cold killer
He can't sleep at night, his victim's eyes piercing through his soul
He wake up every time his eyes close
That's who them young boys aspire to see
Underneath the palm trees, that's who they dying to be
But I'm good
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...

Trade a body for a body
Nigga kamikaze
Tired of living no healthcare, I ain't fucking with wellfare
But its rap down, Hells near, Sherm on every corner like fountains near
G rock, mountaineer, chunk coats a cop would wear, double up, roca wear
Win or lose, none to spare, black jack safety pair
20 rounds one to the head, whole clip strike the beard
Breaking news fuck the feds, buckle up, simon says
Do the job nothing says, neighbors seen this shit for years
Hopped out, out of range, close up not a stain
Gut shot got him maimed, shit bag potty trained
No time for a nigga, got a strike up on my record
And I'm playing shit for what it's gonna be
A nigga sitting on his last hundred plus I owe the homie 50
And my bitch and she ridin' on E
Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze
Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze
Nigga welcome to Hell's kitchen, prayers missing
Doing good has no intentions, with the shit that I'm kicking
Heavens too far from forgiving
Stuck on a mission, Choppers by the windows
See the silhouettes, just like I'm heading fishing
Pay your rent or meet your soul's eviction, greet the reaper
Deliver death like serving pizza, dome piece the shell cracked like Sunday Easter
Feel this Ether, the pyromaniac, you niggas keisters
Ain't shit but ass, newest task is getting cash
Smoking hash and let it ash, off a dime like Steve Nash
22 by my lower calf, see a hawk, we sqeeze and blast

Eminem's my limit slim, we ain't the same no synonym
No synonym, get it in like lucifer, down and dirty emperor
With hell's demons and angels, rat-a-tat-tat-tat sent for ya
I major in your minisher, left his ass holy by the minister
Immortal Kombat finisher

The killers name remains silent
Gangster, Gangster! Read all about it, there's guns in the streets
I know the governments supplying
Prison wars, race riot, ice pick in the neck, flatline
Another comic grave for man kind
Every step I take a land mine, blowin' up like 9-11, Hiroshima, Pearl Harbor
Afghan hobbies, got me feelin' Kamikaze (KABOOM) blow up the party
Sickest lad-i-dadi, peace on Earth you don't remind me
Dying Honor, Uni-bomber, you pre-madonna, I'm ghetto verson of Gia Connor
Mob bosses, count losses gain profits, same logic
Did it all but still stay silent, keep the gangster grooving in my blood 'cause
50's who I do it for, die for mine and ride on yours

You gotta reel 50 times just to get a rack off
Ungh, I can get a hundred of 'em, make over 3 G's
Only took two days, only read it one time, with his son, belly shine
In the rain for about nine months out the year '97 right here
For Seattle nigga, cheers
When I look up at y'all city
Like lookin' in the mirror, damn near had a career
Just might shed a tear
Ungh, yo, man this shit right here
For my niggas who ain't make it home, sitting on a tear
Got a dap to a nigga bright in here
Feeling life ain't fair
If I was in your shoes I would've copped, don't care
Had a scene, had the medics like {clear}
Ungh, big body cold like a Polar Bear
Ungh, I done sold more shit than hookers
Expensive tees, resemble a push up
Stopped selling crack, cause white don't fuck with niggas
Vanity slave, got whips and chains
Dirty money, clean money the same
Even if I got life, I ain't saying a name
I just stopped selling crack today

O-X-Y, a moron

Easy, 60-40-50, you can get one for 30 if you let me hook this titty
Let a nigga fuck then my dogs see your kitty
Just stopped selling crack today
When it get hot, smoke a pill, watch it glide like Dr.J
I prescribe you I'm your doctor kay?
You can crush this shit, you can sniff this shit
You can take this shit, you can smoke this shit
Do you like this shit, nigga?
Your brain go numb, synthetic heroine
Without the injections, do the same love and affection
How could they say feeling good is an addiction?
But the world is full of shit so I don't listen
In fact ""we livin' to die"" is a contradiction
So trapping in a Nissan, O-X-Y, I keep 'em, O-X-Y, you need one
I just stopped selling crack today

Hoodies and weaponry
Naïve to being free
Locked up, we chasing keys
How ya eyes investigate us
While we look up to entertainers, ball players, pistol bangers
Big brothers, uncles, uncles
Betrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle
Huddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land
As I clench down upon this trigger
The burn fuckin' burn
Every step to getting deeper
Survival my main concern
Marinating in Satan's sweat, take a sip of this holy water
Hoping god still keep me blessed
With a dark shield for my armor
Promises man I promised
None of them goals accomplished
Promises man I promised
To be loyal and honest
Promises man I promised
Lied on separate occasions
Promises man I promised
My promises is aging
Hennessy what my system like
Feeling like superman
I might crip tonight
I bring loss to life
A gruesome site
Look who done got involved
Its no different from wars, its kill or be called upon
Feeling teary eyed, thinking I've gone too far

Make it, tasty, nasty, crazy
Give it all you got
Diamonds last forever, baby
Look at what we got
I don't want your money, darling
I just want your love
Diamonds last forever, baby
Look at what we got
I don't want your money, darling
I just want your love"
63,What They Want,2014,Oxymoron (2014),Hip Hop,Schoolboy Q,"This the shit that they need, tell me where are you from
Drop your pants to your knees, yeah, I got the codeine
Might pull up in my bucket
This nine holds a good dozen
Might slide up in your cousin
Just made a mill and still thuggin'
Niggas banged on me, but they should of shot me
See, I hit the corner then spot him, got him
Court date, but I skipped the bail
Rather wig myself before I sit in jail
Need a gang of weed and a pint of lean
Got a hat say Figg on my gangsta tip
Don't trust no ho, I might sock the bitch
I'm apocalypse to your politics
Might cop the Phantom, get ghost
I can pay your bills with this coke
Need an extra band for this smoke
I can see for miles with this scope, nigga
Got an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer
Misses Piggy want a piggyback
Rock cremation then called it crack
I'mma keep on eating till my ankles fat
Sell that fix, throw it cross the map
Push my penis in between her lap
Put my semen all down her throat
Till Tito kilos come off that boat
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need, tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees, girl I'm capital G
This the shit they gon' buy
This the shit why I'm fly, this the shit why I'm high
This the shit they gon' want, this the shit that they want
This the shit that they want (Tell 'em, tell 'em)
If you see my watch I might hit it
If you see my check I might hit it
If you see my house I might hit it
This the shit that they want, this the shit that they need
This the shit that's from me
This the shit they gon' want, this the shit that they want
This the shit that they want
Yeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow
Speeding through the yellow lights
She want Versace belt like it's a mistletoe
I put everything over yellow rice, graduated from hella ice
If I stand on my bank roll, nigga, I'd be scared of heights
And I'd be dodging the po' lights
When I was poor with no lights, when I was poor with potential
Watch my flow in four inches, oh lord she in Christians
All gold on my Adventist, pull it down and she kiss it
All gold where my wrists is, God there's just no convincing
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted
Moving my whip down the boulevard
Word round town I was selling hard
Hard and I'm talking 'bout the yayo
Hit her on the floor and then I lay low
Amigos say ""que pasa with the pesos?""
Promethazine codeine, caseloads (TRU!)
And when I pull up to the valet
You know I got the strippers on payroll!
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need, tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees, girl I'm capital G
This the shit they gon' buy
This the shit why I'm fly, this the shit why I'm high
This the shit they gon' want, this the shit that they want
This the shit that they want (Tell 'em, tell 'em)
If you see my watch I might hit it
If you see my check I might hit it
If you see my house I might hit it
This the shit that they want, this the shit that they need
This the shit that's from me
This the shit they gon' want, this the shit that they want
This the shit that they want
100k in my trunk, keep that bitch with that dunk
She gon' pop in them heels, she must heard of my deal
She gon' roll on them pills, just don't grab on my hat
This that shit that's Iraq, this that make you climax
This that shit you just bought, this that Q go damn hard
This that car that won't park, pedal to the floor, it won't stop
And just when you thought it won't drop, Oxymoron in stores
Come in kids, lock the door, knock knock knock, hit the floor
Need my bread off the top, could buy anything off the lot
This that steel, not the grill, get them slugs off for real
This that crow with the jail, we go in, smoke the L's
She love my mic, rock the bell, leave that punani killed
All them hoes want the Q, spit that truth, make the loot
Expensive whips we hotbox, spent 2 bills on my socks
This that make you cockblock, this that make me pop shot
This that filthy convo, this that must be Figg Road
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need, tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees, girl I'm capital G
This the shit they gon' buy
This the shit why I'm fly, this the shit why I'm high
This the shit they gon' want, this the shit that they want
This the shit that they want (Tell 'em, tell 'em)
If you see my watch I might hit it
If you see my check I might hit it
If you see my house I might hit it

64,Yay Yay,2014,Oxymoron (2014),Hip Hop,Schoolboy Q,"Had pistols in my hands, had pockets full of Ox
Whole life I been a G, had bitches on the block
Had strippers on the pole, had cocaine in the pot
Got fiends at the do' so I turned that to a rock
That yay yay
That yay yay
I'm a drug dealin' nigga, cause them grades ain't get me paid
My agenda for today is to make bread or get laid
See my daughter need some shoes and my mom work overtime
So I'm standin' by that stop sign with nickels and them dimes
Keep that work, got that Oxy, need that kilo, call that papi
Know my steelo, shrimp with sake, sold that hero'n, look like toffee
Keep my nina, just might off him, no them boys on Figg don't play
Most my life on 51st, went to school on 52nd
Used to fight on 49th, Grandma said be home by night
But her old ass sixty something, so three hours late aiight
Still I love her, R.I.P., when she died, I took her place
And became a fucking G, moved my crack across the street
Figg get it, get it yeah
Drug dealin' nigga
Yawk yawk yawk
Had pistols in my hands, had pockets full of Ox
Whole life I been a G, had bitches on the block
Had strippers on the pole, had cocaine in the pot
Got fiends at the do' so I turned that to a rock
That yay yay
That yay yay
I'm a drug dealin' nigga, roll my cyc' on Hoover's street
Just a year after Pac died we all bump Suga Free
Didn't know what he was sayin' till them years done jumped to three
Learned the game, slangin' hoes and every car door need a key
Charge them smokers day through night, sellin' pies who need a slice
Life is craps so shoot the dice, get the cheese but cut the mice
Enemies be left to right, we don't call our shit the trap
Bitch we call our shit the set, unless we OD with Reynold's Wrap
After crack it's Oxy next, but thank God the yay was yay
Off the yee like it's the bay, rock a chain I'm Kunta K
Out in Texas what's the word, keep them packs and that's for sure
Slang to him and slang to her, ask a fiend they will concur
Figg get it, get it yeah
Drug dealin' nigga
Yawk yawk yawk"
