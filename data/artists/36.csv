Mork from Ork, first take support see me in The Source
Yo I take the Eighty-Five Percent brain
Cause Black makes what makes rain
Dirty brain is like payday to me
GOD, Unique baby
Who's the Five Percent of the planet Earth?
Tell 'em Poppa Wu, well it sure ain't Poppa Smurf!
Got to check your blood, take you to church
Ministers down with the NURSE
Ever since birth,
White man always tryin' to take the black man's turf
Black man built America
I named ya after Asia, you ain't my MOMMA!
Now her name is Erika, Bo Derek-ah
What, you like that slave name?
It wasn't 'posed to sound better
New Rule order, New Rule order
For ALL the maniacs in jail read this letter
Be behind me when I'm makin' this cheddar
'Cause I'ma make it more better, for our babies
SO they play in A SAFE schoolyard everyday
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
You've, got, that WHITE WHITE WHITE WHITE
White man clock on your wall
I'm tired of gettin' up goin' to work
For that WHITE WHITE WHITE WHITE man y'all
I's got a BLACK boss
These thoughts was fuckin' Diana Ross
I ain't know it was easy makin' this money
Nuh! sell yo shit!
Whitey come on, get the money (GET THE MONEY)
My Father Allah walk with Gods
Just like the dollar bill walk with God We Trust
And I walk this dog, two-thousand two-hundred miles for you
Whaaaaaaaaat? Let the ?? know it's done
Hey blackie, yo whitey

You understand me? It's the Dirt Dog speakin'
My word is BOND, and my bond is life
It's all in together now my niggaz, and my niggarettes
My peoples, don't worry about it
It's all slang from the same gang
I'm black out, and I'm black in
I'm white out, and I'm white in

(Intro: C-Murder)
Tytanic, let's wake 'em up, ya heard?
Yeah, it's real out here
Killa block notch, wit' the ODB
NYC, CP-3, nigga, what?
Let me ask you a question
What do you think about the game now? (What you think about it now?)
How you feel like my name now (How you feel 'bout me now?)
How you feel like C now?
What do you think about the ODB now? (What?)
What do you think about the game now? (What you think about it now?)
How you feel like my name now (How you feel about me now?)
How you feel like my name now (I told you I wanted somethin')
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Yeah, bite that point, the habit apprievin'
No hope to find, that you're misbehavin'
Link your crupid, fuck your brewin'
Flash the burgers on your crewin'
'Cause the monks, skippin' from the other MC's
I got the amazing ability
I get on the mic so you can have a ball
I could fly through the air and stick to the wall
I could take a punch or get hit by a car
Could go to the nearest or farthest star
As a matter of fact it's what I won't talk about
Pop a word out of trace just to be in the house
(Chorus: E-40)
So pimped out about my big spendish
I got a 20, 6 O'Clock extra chrystall
Anybody dat wanna pop off at the lip
Anybody that wanna give me banana split
It's only E-40, Murder in this bitch
All the money motivated me to biatch
Three soldiers from the East, South and West
Street soldiers holdin' it down for they vets
(C-Murder)
I'm C-Murder, murder mass ten, I'm wit' the Dirty Bastard
And my flows comin' faster than a jet to Alaska
I ask ya how you feelin' my collabo'
The CP3, the ODB from NYC the ghetto B
Light it up, let it cook, look in the mirror, let me crush
Don't worry about how it looks, put some momey on my books
Only God can judge me now
That's when I heard the click click, I was Christened
I ain't with them are you wid that
Let them whistles out them pistols
Let loose on them troops and then shake 'em like Cherok smoke
I slam dunk 'em like Shaq
I wanna be free, I'm not guilty, do you feel me?
(E-40)
Hey sluggin', wanna hit this rock dowm (rock down)
I only got one world, mane, I feel like take this to the thick of him
Under there, got the smell, you do the hoe you hear
Fuck it there, let me get a swig of that Thunder Bird
OK, it's cute, it's squashed
Now, no though mane, lets have a back wash
Yeah you trippin', ""no I ain't"", yeah you is
That boy spittin', what's his name? 40, quarter, biatch
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
I stage a place, place stage a me
I'm a vision of truth, just a true MC
Love hiphop so much, mic won't untouched
Thugs grow unbust, bitch won't get fucked
Every 40 ounce cracked, every napsack packed
Ol' Dirty kickin' your ass, the record gets scrapped
Oh, the record gets scrapped, the record gets scrapped
(Outro: E-40)
And there you have it
E-40 the bonzerelli
The ballatician from the Soyo block soil
Turf hall, been through it all
Hard till we have it all (hard till we have it all)
Ay look it's C-Murder and Ol'Dirty Bastard
If you don't stay your ass out of trouble
What's up boy? ODB
We got the same motherfuckin' birthday
November the 12th to be exact motherfuckers
What the fuck you drinkin'? Fortay
Get 'em off this motherfucker..."

Oh yeahhahhahheeyahhhyahhhhohhhyah

Ahhahhahhhah
Verse One:
I'm the dog who's ahead of the Lords
Dirty Bastard from the Wu-Tang squad
Can I get raw, yes I get Dirty to the floor
Rhymes, hittin on your mind, you could never ignore
Hip-hop to me is like a place to be
My specialTY from me to you is emCEE
Say what you wanna sayyyah, baby sayah
I flip the microphone-ah, any dayah
I'm mad swift because I got that gift of gab
Niggaz get mad, your ass stink never had
This talent that I got will resound the spot
MC's, you got paid a lot
You ever notice a black man damn mostly slams
When it come to the money yo it ain't funny
It's what you gotta do what you got to do
C'mon, can I get a Wu-Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, it's on your brain
I get riggy diggy raw when it's time to get
On the dancefloor shotgun kill the shit
BLAOW, then you won't step to me
Thinking is he really raw as he said he'd be
If I wasn't really raw, standing here on the floor
You'd be like BOOOOO HE AIN'T NO HARDCORE
Niggaz play like they live but won't survive
Jumpin' up and down ticklin that jive when you ticklin gab
I'm an average man, G-O-D fan
Let it be known who's the champ, Wu-Tang Clan!
It's coming through and WU, boy it's bad too!
Throw your hands in the air, if you don't care
WHO, the Ol Dirty Bastard be
Oh me on my, you be hoppin on my shit just like a fly
BZZZZZT, all around
The dirtiest stinkin sound down to the ground
What what, what you wanna do?
What you wanna do when I'm coming for you?
I'm gonna give it to ya, bayyybah, bayybah,
Bayybahhhahahahahahahahahahah..."
4,Back In The Air,2005,A Son Unique (2005),Hip Hop,Ol' Dirty Bastard,"We used to sleep in the staircase, smoke weed in the staircase
Friday night got drunk, used to pee in the staircase
Hopin' a cop might slip and never known to drop the clip
You copped the fifth, nigga, I'll pop the fifth
I show no mercy, dunk like a bottle of Hershey
Call my gun, Lil' Seymore, bitch or Big Percy
A Dapper Dan fan who will clap a man
For five grand of small bills, wrapped in a rubber band
Then lay up in a fat pair of titties, my bitch is so saditty
This is Dirt McGirt, hoe, not P. Diddy
All we got in common is the money
The only thing I want is the money
You see my face on the wall of every precinct
Bitches keep your pussy decent, I'm juvenile delinquent
For guns that I creep with they whisper in secret
Only bitch that peepin' is the one that I sleep with, nih huh
Alotta niggas wanna dust me off
Bad bitches wanna suck me off
(What, what?)
Dropped a million here
And Dirt McGirt back in the air
All my gangstas, where ya at?
Throw your guns up and make them clap
Tell me now, muthafuckas, you strapped?
And bitch betta have my money
Aiyo, the bitch better your money and mine
'Cause if she don't, we both gon' double team that bitch from behind
And for them niggas outside screamin' that
'Somebody gotta die' shit, same dudes on the cop's dick
This is Tone, y'all niggas be frontin'
And most of y'all niggas don't got no guns
Borrowed your man's shit, how's that for a bum?
Dum-dums emptied out of pun son, so see man, see Ach' run
See spots over my Reebok's 'cause he got done
Cheap shots fell out his weak glock and he got stung
My cheap gun is a gangsta's protein
Treat bitches with the upmost respect like get 'em wetted
Tellin' to drink the milk, boo, don't even wet it
This is Starky, I got a foot fetish, loot fetish
With the dusthead men, we got good credit
Alotta niggas wanna dust me off
Bad bitches wanna suck me off
(What, what?)
Dropped a million here
And Dirt McGirt back in the air
All my gangstas, where ya at?
Throw your guns up and make them clap
Tell me now, muthafuckas, you strapped?
And bitch betta have my money
Notorious glock buster, cap pealin', block hustler
Who slap hoes? Who lack feelings?
Black building, crack dealing, black villain
Had a taste for blood steelin', love stealin'
Anything that twinkle bright to my eye sight
Many nights I used to stay up at the twilight
And wonder to myself if's there's a heaven or hell
Been alone in these streets since eleven or twelve
On my own, I run buck wild in the west
A knucklehead nigga, used to sleep in my vest
Had no home, my mom used to show me no lovin'
Burn the crib down, tryna dry my shirt with the oven
Now I'm exiled, destined for penal
Hyperactive off the cocaine, got me senile
Back on the block, knowledge to build, knowledge to kill
Intent to put a dent in your grill with the steal
Alotta niggas wanna dust me off
Bad bitches wanna suck me off
(What, what?)
Dropped a million here
And Dirt McGirt back in the air
All my gangstas, where ya at?
Throw your guns up and make them clap
Tell me now, muthafuckas, you strapped?
And bitch betta have my money"

Talent that I got will result to swat MCs I be burnin burnin hot

Get all that good shit, get all that good shit (one two, one two)
One two, one two, one two... one two
Now niggaz know
Ssssshhhit, yo yo check this out, check this joint
This is strictly for the radio, yo

The reason why I curse is because my momma and my daddy
They grew up cursin
So please respect my style, please!
Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard
I'll grab the mic and now I damage you, cut your whole stamin-u
Oh, sssshit, nah
I'll grab the mic and now I damage ya, cut your whole staminuh
Here comes the medical examinuh
One verse then you out for the count

Ya yo, I'm sorry, un-gah-e-gas-e-ya
I'll grab and the mic and now I damage you, cut your whole stamiNUH
Here comes the medical examiNUH
One verse then you're out for the count
Bring the ammonia, make sure he sniffs the right amount
Wake you up and then I ask you
How do you intend this --
Competition to get an asssss kickin so tremendous, RARRH!
You shouldn't bother this
Leave me alone like a son he'll be fatherless!
I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco
Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Crisco
And MC's start to vanish
I rolled up on a jet black kid the nigga started speakin' Spanish
Yo! You wasn't from Panana!
I asked you how you get so fuckin' dark, you said suntama
He responded so fast, you made me laugh
Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH scared-his ass!
Kick the hundred strongest rhymes
Then I brought out the punk in him
Roll up with the strong five deadly venoms
Told HIM! Enter the Wu-Tang!
Witness the Shaolin slang, that crush any shit you bring
I watch your ass take a big fall, why?!
My Main Source, is like a friendly game of stickball
And as you step up to bat man, I play the riddler
You try to do me for my nigga I'll change to Hitler
I'll go out like Nazi, wish your fuckin' ass stayed
Home and play Yahtzee!
Or watchin Happy Days sweatin Poxie
With Ralphie and Cunningham, Joni and Chachi
(Yo Unique, yo kid
Check this shit out! Yo, yo)
Verse Two: Ghostface Killer
Ninety-five niggaz is wasted
Keystone capered, and Wu kept the rap fiends basted
Foamin out the mouthpiece, heads blown like geese
Murderous police, I do shows and perform in Grease
It's not magic, gaming is the gadget
World classic big national high attracts dear graphics
Lampin in my own zone, my physical show
Inhale bones Tony stuck, for the diamond in Rome
He's convincin, labelled one man rap convention
The nigga that'll gun down, eighty frenchmen
Lead vocalist, music specialist, rap arsonist
I deal with sharpness plus spark the hardest individual
I plant crimes inside vocals
My rap's like my passport, my life's my proof
Hit the sun roof, be out like a wanderin dream
Shuttle, and get startled off the verbal hygiene, my nigga
(Sample of Stamina)
(Sample of Baby C'mon)
(Sample of Brooklyn Zoo)
(Sample of Drunk Game (Sweet Sugar Pie)
(Sample of The Stomp)
Shame on you when you step through to
Ol Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo!
Shame on you when you step through to
Ol Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo!
What?! My nuh
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo
Shame on you when you step through to
THe Ol Dirty Bastard, Brooklyn Zoo
To the West coast!
To the East coast
To the North coast
To the South
When you take North, East, West, South
Put it all together and it spell NEWS!
Then you got the ol rhythm, bastard blues
And ya don't stop
So keep your shit, motherfucker, fucker, fucker!

Yo, this Dirt McGirt representin' Brooklyn
We gettin' ready to wreck shit up, downtown, uptown
(Boroughs, y'all niggaz better know it's something) Wu-Tang, bitch
(Get ya fuckin' head punched ya fuckin' shoulders, duke
This is how we do, everyday, blast through your motherfuckin' speaker, nigga)
Bastards!
(Chorus: Baby Sham)
Uh, we be so caked up, y'all best wake up
It's just us and we livin' this up
We sip that cognac, then lean far back
It's just us, and we flippin' the truck
Don't be so gassed up, be foul, assed up
When them coroners, pickin' you up
First you was in a black tux, now you all axed up
You smashed what, like you givin' it up
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
I'm good with them free throws, like I play ball
When the war is on, it's McGirt that you call
The last man standing, heavy with the cannon
Come through on a bike, with a bulletproof, prancin'
Leave you in your pearl, put you on the porch, dancin'
And leave your brains on the back of a white shirt
While they playin' some old school shit by Al and Bert
(To all my bitches that smell like perfume, Dirt McGirt be here for you baby)
I'm not gonna stop till I'm under the dirt
(Baby Sham)
You can never be as half as me
'Cause one thing'll lead to another, cock sucker, melt ya knees
And make sure that your casket's deep
'Cause my trigger finger's itchin' like Athlete's feet
So stand wise, when you meet the chief
And watch your movements in the circle of the ultra-beast
I'm that nigga that'll culture speak
Whose gon' ride, whose gon' die, divorce your peeps
It get's worse on the down reaking
So please, dog, do you a favor, move from around me
'Cause I set my boundaries, you wanna know where I'm from
Ask Bust' where he found me, true B
Paper chasin', Franklin' raping
And for sure, I'm gonna make my statement
And believe that the shit is taken
'Cause the gun, playin' long, like vacations
(Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard)
We lay the law down, motherfucker
Big Moses in the motherfucker house
Any way that nigga go out, that's how the nigga go out

You can't do nothin' wit' it, I put you in the past
You broken motherfuckers, shut the fuck up
I do it till you bad luck and head gets plucked
The only thing on your brain is to give me this cash
Stay out of my business 'cause I'm takin' your tash
This struggle on the ming, non of y'all bring
I got y'all in... flavouring
(Mack 10)
I seem to fuck about a bitch or a crooked ass cop
I'm a burst that, it's dealin', the hustle don't stop
I got stones and hairone, ecstasy and weed
Meth, imphetamine, sherm, sticks and speed
Pay it high wid, dope is all I got to give
I'm a ghetto nigga dog so I get it how I live
Got money, lock 'em off, fuckers still I got drama
Got two strike dog and five baby mamas
With new strain I maintain, I'm ready and willin'
To keep change on niggas brains to keep the blood spillin'
I hate it but it ain't complicated, it's real simple
Fuck with me and know you get a hole in your temple
I ain't gonna play you niggas, I'ma slay you niggas
Don't take but a few figures and a few new triggers
Mack 10 livin' legend, every West coast rhymin'
Straight hoo bangin' gangsta and all rhymin' sodom, it's bad
(Royal Flush)
Shut up, let me talk for a minute, alot of bull shit on my mind
Dealin' with crime, alot of y'all dealin' wid rhymes
Stuck on the grind, crackheads cookin' my pies
Startin' off on the 1-2-5, the block's mine
Bucket the spine, DH tryna tap my line
Stop my producitons, wanna know my money discussions
Who I roll wid, ""buy so many cars is he legitin' of my dick""
It didn't matter when I ain't have shit
They done watch me in helicopters, parklin' in my crib
All I wanna feed is my kids, no time to do a bid
Feel me, I forced the whole guns a while for my ones
Didn't sell drugs, where the money come from?
No school, no job, no bitch, no food, fuck that
Do what I do to make my shit true
And I make it hard on them boys who blew they cats charges
If I go to jail you know I'm blowin' on the Sergeants"
10,Cold Blooded,1999,Nigga Please (1999),Hip Hop,Ol' Dirty Bastard,"Y'all no nothing about the pimp game,
I wanna thank Rick James for letting me do this song
Thank you very much
Who are you?(who are you?)
Girl who do you belong to?
My point of view is
Girl I think you're hot!
If we halt
What words will I describe
There's no dictionary book
To explain how you look
Because I think you're hot!
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Cold Blooded!
Girl I think you're hot!
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Cold Blooded!
Who are you?
Girl what's your name and number?
Is it true?
Girl you think I'm hot!
If we tried
To get to know each other
You might find
You couldn't trade me for another!
'Cause I think you're so!
Sweetheart baby,
Touch me girl where I want to me touched
Don't ever complain, gotcha in a cobra clutch
Love me tender, love me sweet
I wanna bust this nut in a superfreak
Oh you're a superfreak, fuck me anywhere
Great skin never do a do or dare
I wanna undress you, hold your loosie tight
And I won't cum all night!

It's Ol' Dirty Bastard and shit, knowI'msayin?
I wanna give a big shout out to my nigga Luke
KnowI'msayin? You know, you know, know
I wanna lock all the bitches down
I wanna lock all the bitches down from the North,
To East, to West, to South
KnowI'msayin?
I wanna... help me put these bitches in my trance
I want y'all to suck my lizard
You bitches wanna fuck me when you smell my under-arm
(ODB)
I make yo' dick disappear
I ain't hearin anymore weird sounds in the ear
PSSSSSSS... you can't purr no more
You wanna kneal and suck dick? I'ma keep your throat sore
Bitches got herpes in ya ass
Every time you fuck a nigga, he dies fast
And you won't last
The pussy break down from a rash
It's hard for you to walk, 'cause you stuck up in your ass
Don't ask me for no cash
You better not be tellin' me to give them no cash
Ash, bash, crash, sad ass
(Chorus: ODB)
Give me a little of that Cracker Jack
You ain't caramel coated Cracker Jack
The surprise, bitch you gonna get waxed
This that shit, you can't do nothin' about
(ODB)
Girls ain't pretty to me anymore
'Cause you ain't bein a real whore
Ooh, you ain't a real whore
*Yells some crazy shit*
You can't say, wear nails anymore
You ain't givin' up, a manicure
Suckin my dick is gonna be your chore
If you don't, you're punishment
You can't get off until ya suck my dick
Physically I operate your brain to function
Give me anything, that I wantin
All girls wanna fuck me everyday
And give me that, the money
Don't even know what happens naturally
Especially when I'm playin' with the chemistry
The money comin' to me first
You gonna keep dyin' till you die from thirst
I want a different girl everyday
If you wanna die, you gotta drink my sperm
The other way to die, is eat a can of worms
(Outro: ODB)
Give me a little...
Yo, I love you girls 'cause you wanna stick your tongue up in my ass
Or you can't taste, smell, touch or hear, or see
I got you in a smash, give me it!

12,Cuttin' Headz,1995,Return To The 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version (1995),Hip Hop,Ol' Dirty Bastard,"Here it is
Where's it at?
In the back
Got a stack
The Dirty Bastard
Yo you Bastard flip the phat track
Here I go, here I go, whether friend whether foe
Let them know that I flow over the rainbow
Hit the deck
Aw, yep, (ch-ch plow) from the Tek, takin' heads, takin' necks
What the fuck they expect?
I don't know
I don't care
I won't fall
I won't stare at a ho, less I know that I'm going to the mo-
T-t-tel, 'cause I'm lousy, technique is drowsy
Stop tryin' to foul me
Sayin' that we're lousy
But I'm a tyrant, defiant, walkin' New York Giant
President of the Wu
But I'm also a client
It's the Wu, what, you knew what, you do what, what, who, what, what
I don't give a flying fuck
About a chump, cause this heart only pumps Kool-Aid
Snatch a kid by the braids, and cut his head off
Rhymes is rugged like burnt buildings in Harlem
The Ol Dirty Bastard from the Temple of Shaolin
Dirty to the brain like drops of acid rain
Clang, clang, clang, rhymes pluckin at your brain
So take a sip from the cup of death
And when you're shaking my right hand, I'll stab you with the left
(Whirr whirr whirrr!) Red alert! Red alert!
Ason comin' straight from the dirt
Once I go berzerk, mad brothers got hurt
Nothin' new in ninety-two
It's time to do the work
Trails of vatos scream once I hop on the scene
And fear the return of the fatal flying guillotine
Mr. Milli, that means I'm also militant
Don't wear no suit and tie, I'm no gentleman
Gettin' laid, takin' heads, that's my hobby
Punch a brother in the face who call me Robbie
I be the RZA, call me that 'cause-I
Never liked the name I received from my poppa
Dirty deluxe, yo, I'm huntin for ducks
Snatchin devils up by the hair, then cut his head off"

Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard (GZA in brackets)
I'll grab and the mic and now I damage you, cut your whole stamina
Here comes the medical examiner
One verse then you're out for the count
(Bring the ammonia) make sure he sniffs the right amount
Wake him up and then I ask him
Why did he intend this --
Competition to get an ass kickin so tremendous
Boy you shouldn't bother this
Leave me alone like the (son said G or he'll be fatherless!)
I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco
Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Crisco
And MC's start to vanish
(I stepped up to a jet black kid, started speakin' Spanish!
Yo he wasn't from Panama
I asked him how he get so dark, the nigga said suntama!
He responded so fast, you made me laugh)
Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH (then I scared-his ass!)
(Kick the hundred strongest rhymes
I brought out the punk in him
Caught him with a strong five deadly venom
Told him enter the Wu-Tang
Witness the Shaolin slang, that'll crush the shit you bring)
I watch your ass take a big fall, why?!
My Main Source, is like a friendly game of stickball
And as you step up to bat man (I play the riddler)
You try to do me for a rhyme (then I'll change to Hitler)
Go out like Nazi; you'll be wishin your fuckin' ass stayed
Home and played (Yahtzee!)
Or watchin Happy Days sweatin (Poxie)
With Ralphie and Richie Cunningham, Joni and (Chachi)
Wu, who? Me gettin' wreck so I'm through
Like a ten and a half foot, gettin' in a seven (shoe)
(Now picture THAT with a Minolta)
Have your ass doin' some Night Fever shit like John Travolta
I come strong I make knowledge born, I flip the script
And rock on from P.M. (past the fucking Dawn)
Pass the Hammer you're broke down, niggaz grab my what what
Can't understand it here's the panaroma
(A complete view of how I defeat you)
Should of stepped to those fuckin' kids who tried to (beat you)
Yeah I bust that ass before
(You ran to Texas and came back but forgot the chainsaw!)
And want to perform a massacre
Better be coming with some motherfucking shit that's spectacular
Crush the person who did em, well you just better
So I'm stepping to your (raggedy ass jetta)
Put the pedal to the metal
You and your DJ change your name to Ma and Pa Kettle
As I (pass the bone, kicks your every measure)
It's not a Newport but it's still live with pleasure
(C'mon don't be silly, just a bag of sensimilli
Rolled up in a) Motown Philly
(I used to write all the time when I smoked
Grab the mic, then I kinda like went for broke
With visually concepts strongest rhymes and biceps
Lyrically speakin', three to four rhymes then choke
Some think they be harmin this, claimin they be bombin this)
But they still remains a-nom-ynous
I pull strings like Jimi Hendrix
Ride more beats that go backs to the days of Eddie Kendricks
I teach the truth to the youth, I say (hey youth)
Here's the truth, better start wearing (bullet proof)
Arm yourself with a shield
(Before you get trapped up) just like the Children in the Cornfield"

(Ol Dirty Bastard is doing a Martin Lawrence comedy skit from Raw)
(This is going on in the background during the Intro and part
Of the first verse)
You know God damn well I don't smoke this shit Meth
*Coughing* Know damn well I don't smoke this sheyit
Know damn well!
I remember when we used to go down to the creek
Member when we used to go down to the creek?
And used to dip your head in the water?
Everybody thought you had it in you, you know
You used to jump out the water
The water used to glisten alllllll over your bohhhhhhdy
What? I said the water used to glisten alllllll over your bohhhhhhdy
Intro: Ol Dirty Bastard
Clean out my vocals
Yeah, I said Yeah
I said zuckazuhzuhzuh, zuckazuhzuh
*More nonsense noises*
Chkccha ckchcka Brooklyn, zucka Zoo
C'mon baby baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, c'mon!
Verse One:
Superlogical this, superlogical that
I detect a nigga dialect by the way he rap
I elect myself President MC
My career so intelligent, unique physique
Then with mathematics, not democratic
Static, topic, Asiatic
Zssshuh, them unique, never leak, brlaharl...
Bring it on back
Superlogical this, superlogical that
I detect your dialect by the way you rappp!
I elect myself President MC

Doin' mathematics and I'm not democratci
No static, topic, I'm Asiatic
See, I'm Unique, never... blarhalal...
Verse Two: Method Man, Ol Dirty Bastard
Crazy, lurkin in the shadows, I'm shady, sheisty
Get your weight up, don't take me lightly
Blasted, dirty to the grain I be stained with the madness
It's the Meth-Tical with the Bastard
MZA MZA my name is the Ol Dirty Bas
My gammmmme, to kick your ass
Dnnah duh dnnh dnnh duh duh!

Flip and relax, take an Ex-Lax, I'm shittin
On the industry that was frontin now they missin'

You are now in my trance
You are getting sleeeeeepy
You are now getting sleeeepy
And sleeeeppieeerrrrr
And sleepy, and sleepy
Verse Three: Method Man
This one here's for my people, my people
Enter the 36 chambers, the sequel
Part two, for me and the cipher troop
With the Teflon lyrics that you can't get through
With the twenty-two automatic rap you pack, what?
You ain't hittin with that wack shit you kickin
Straight from the beginning, of the game
All the way to the ninth inning, I bring the pain
Dark like the midnight train on the track by the RZA
Diesel like Arnold Schwarzanegger
Outro: Ol Dirty Bastard

Ask you a question, test the Ason
Extra extra, read the drama and thennn another one

(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Two steps from the border line
Anything closer will kiss the nine
Think I'm out the game? You out of your mind
'Cause I stay on track, like transit line
Keep it nappy or braided up
Dirty in the cockpit, blazin' up
Stop frontin' when you made it up
Tellin' all my hoes, you can't spray it up
Hah, huggin' nuts like tighty whites
Still trickin' on hoes like Heidi Fleiss
You know why niggas don't give you much respect
'Cause they seen you gettin' slapped with the empty gat
Know Dirt, like bow know death
When I'm huntin' down, birds of rap
Hate Dog, 'cause I ate your cat
And you can eat my ass and have a coke with that
Use a spoon, unless you want a fork
Pull my dick out, watch the room get dark
Stay high with the zombie walk
Gotta sit my ass down, like Rosa Parks
(Chorus 2X: high pitched female (Ol' Dirty Bastard))
Dirty Dirty, you tell me how you do it
It look so easy, like there was nothin' to it
But they don't understand, about the Dirty M.C.
It's the... (Oh), new track by ODB
(Rhymefest)
They say dirt and sunshine make the flowers grow
I say, fuck a bitch raw and drive your nut on the floor
Call it what you want, you son of a hoe
I was 5 percent till white bitches came and dropped it down to four
3, 2, 1, I can lick the sun with my tongue
Pull it out and smack a nigga, just for thinkin' I'm done
Shut your trap, razor blade cut your wrap
Fat girls seen my comin', started tuckin' their flab
Rhymefest and Dirt Dog, gon' spark this
The day he got to heaven, track mud on the carpets
Hot like the hot potato, you niggas ain't motto
You hot as the spot, yo
Go to the show, for hot dogs and nacho's
This me and Dirt Dog's style, it's not yours
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
What can make a hoe, look more cuter
But, Hennessey shots, and smoke more Buddha
(Rhymefest)
I don't know Dirt, now she look like Zab Judah
Test my manhood, go get my dick ruler
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Now you hungry, wanna eat right through her
But you better first track for a noter
Like does she have a best friend, or I taught her
Has she ever tried fuckin' under water
(Rhymefest)
Down down with the fishes, deep sea dishes
I ain't a genie, bitch, I don't respect your wishes
This trick ain't fuckin' me though, god damn
Something very wrong, I don't understand
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Misinterpetate, let me break it down
Two pulls make the your merry go round
Touch your toes, show me that rose
Butt naked, in a Wu-Tang pose
Wide open, girl, everything goes
Real freaky, when you powder that nose
(Rhymefest)
Keep it and move, I sleep in the nude
I'm keepin' it rude, pull out my dick and pee in the food
On the way to the stars, don, where's the map?
We fuckin' there, and we gonna fuck back
(Outro: Rhymefest)
Yeah, Dirt Dog, Rhymefest, you want it, man
Rest in peace, I know you heaven right now
Trackin' mud on the carpet, so, we gon' let ya
Do what you do it's the oh
Don't forget the crew, it's the Wuuuuuu
I thought you knew, it's the Ol' Dirt Dog
Rhymefest, yeah yeah, from now to 3000, man
What's rap with Dirty? What's the world without Dirt?
Just a bunch of fuckin' water, oh
We out..."

Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby, I'm about to explode...

It's Dirty Run, when you see me coming high
Nine times out of ten, don't wonder how
It's Dirty Run, it's Dirty Run, no more vacancies
I'm a minute from feeling no sympathy
When you see me coming high
It's nine times out of ten, you will wonder how
It's Dirty Run, it's Dirty Run -- ""Run"" -- Run-DMC sample
I'm a minute from feeling no sympathy

Bitches be actin' like they so damn fine
That's why I fuck 'em at the drop of a dime
Needle dick niggaz, go fuck a needle
Before I squash a John Lennon, like a Beetle
Dirt McGirt, Mr. McGirt to the hoes
Stinkin' rich, cover your mouth and your nose
Man of my codes, it's old man, dig it?
Sometimes rockin' went, and Dirty might kick it
Damn, your takers, that's the type to flight
To get any more suck, how niggaz dick through a flint
Big pimp, watch the fur bad
A hundred lick, hundred lick, hundred lick fabulous
Bring it like a bus full of travelers
Turn it up so the cops will get mad at us

When, turn it down a little
'Cause the ground is startin' to crack a little

Diamond, baby, in the time and place

Hold on tight and don't let go, baby I'm about to explode...
Take that bitch for bite, my name Dirt Dog not cake with ice, bitch
Fuck bitin', when there's so much pussy
If you ain't into ass, then pimp 'em for the cash

Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard
Approach the school nine thirty, you're late
This time happy the solution was my date.
Get in your class, walk to your chair
Pop is all you see and then occasionally stare
At the teacher, more, tune in to we're clocking ya.
Lean back at this girl kept clockin' ya hood
Simulated from a [sensimilia] blonde,
Tell the young girl ""Baby, you're the one I want.""
She doesn't respond, pretends to ignore
So you say to yourself, it be her old and sore mentally
Pitchin' lies, the aim on the board as hot and wild pussy
You cannot afford this
Ooh, what slim and trim was my inner friend
Dear, quietly I want him to know my boots,
To rap out loose in my class,
But I kept sayin' the size of my dick and that ass.
So I turned around to arrange a date.
Swinging episode, baby number one's gotta say it
She popped a gum, cold twist to come
I said ""Baby, how you feel?""
She said ""Sure""
Then I said ""sure"", I just found my thrill
Wear it in the classroom, know I'm Blueberry Hill
'Cause what I said just bottled her hate.
She put her face on the chest, this is what the bitch said:
""Because of you I ain't hurting, but then my within my heart
Cause no, I'm not right to be flirtin, but our relationship has to start.
You're the one that I'm clocking, stop or you could stop mockin'
Don't want you to see me cry, this is why, this is why, this is why!""
Verse Two: Killah Priest
I met a girl named Chandra, from way down yonder
The apple of my eye had a Snapple and some fries
Forgot the catsup, that's when I pressed up
""I've been watching you mowing your lawn""
The thoughts were flowin, while I'm holding the palm
""Hey what's that on your menu?"", from there we continued
And talk about this and that we chit and chat
Sipped on the Coke then I stroked the back
As she giggled and I wiggled to the bra
She said ""nah!"", that's when I noticed her pah
Big Tank, who did nothing but the spank
At parties, drink Bacardi and didn't think
Just act silly, with his brother Willy
Another hillbilly gettin' ill with the Philly
And moonshine, but it's a new time of day
On the stoop doing the Patty Duke
OK, it's like that old flip flaps through the shower caps
The platform shoes to Apple Jacks
Chub chub!
Interlude: Ol Dirty Bastard
Yo, you niggaz, niggaz be actin' like
They be lovin' them, them them fancy bitches
I, I likes me a nasty bitch
Bitch that's willing to do anything at any given time
Bitch gotta be nasty 'cause I'm a nasty nigga
I do anything baby, I wouldn't give a fuck what it was
I'll, ah, anything - I'm a nasty motherfucker girl
Verse Three: Ol Dirty Bastard
I'm just sittin' right, in my class at a quarter to ten right?
Waiting patiently for the class to begin right?
Teacher says ""open up your texts, you! read the first paragraph on
Oral sex!""
I said ""Oral sex!, what kind of class is this?!""
Yo, next to me said ""what's wrong with you man?, this is a lesson that
Makes you feel fine, kinda ease your nerves and relax your mind!""
I said ""Don't try to use no hypnotic spell!""
She said ""Be my assistant, I'd show rather tell!""
My knees buckled heart started to drop
My dick grew to a size that my nerve couldn't stop
I tried to run! She yelled out ""freeze!""
Pulled down my draws, dropped to her knees
Ripped of my draws as if she had claws
Broke the rules that defined sex laws
She responded quick, with a slick, welcoming kiss and a ice cream lick
Ooh I begged, I begged, ""Easy on my balls, they're fragile as eggs.""

(The first line originally ended ""Dirty Dancin"" on Jerky Boys soundtrack)
Shit that makes me high
(One two, one two)
Yo, we gonna bring it down, to Harlem World
Bust your fuckin' chops
Yo I remember when niggaz was lookin' at themselves
On Farmers, motherfuckers was wearin double goose
Motherfuckers actin' all rowdy
I'm sayin' though
(One two, one two)
The whole trip that was never shown
I'm sayin' though
See cause the knife, is the knife, of all knives
Most people gather around
To hear the show, that is comin' through your town
(I was playin')
See my name [what what?]
Is somethin', that you won't know
Unless you're dowwwwwwwwn, with the Brooklyn Zoo
Other brothers come
But never... come back
(Introducing)
So basically, what the Ol motherfuckin Dirty Bastard is sayin'
Is that if you fuck around [one two, one two]
You're gonna get yo' ass fucked up
So don't fuck around just lay down
Verse One: Ol Dirty Bastard
I remember (dnnah-dah) (dnh, duh, dnh, dnnah-dah)
Not too long ago "" ""
I went to a city "" ""
And I saw a Wu-Tang show "" ""
Now I always wanted "" ""
To get, with, the band "" ""
But niggaz was singin' they own songs
Bein in they own worlds
So I guess I, I guess I, RARAARRRRAAHHH!
The terminology, the psychology
You still expect me to accept
Do what I say off of TV, kay
With the button on record and the other on
Thus I press pause for a serious cause
To respect an intellect with this gratifying
Now that I'm ready let the music begin
As I detect what I wrote with my
Through the time that I spent, money that I lent
Rap records went up just to bounce
Then became a new way to get paid
They said ""Rhymin on the mic is the number one""
Then a brother get the feeling that he want to play cool
You discombumberated diabolical fool
Hog-flesh MC, go play in the mud
Another 20th century, modern day
Cannibal, humanoid, underground
Chud broke loose from the god damn
Dope-fiend addict why you walk with
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
When the MC's came, to live out their name
Roast rockin' rhymes that was always
When I elevated, and mastered the time
You was stimulated from the high post
You got shot cause you knew you were rot
Verse Two:
You're not the king of the diss
Youse a queen of a bitch
And like a homosexual
Your ass always switch
Niggaz wake up in the morning
You're ugly-ass Gods
Got slob around your mouth
Blue code in your eye
You can't smile your teeth too gritty
Can't even move, drawers too shitty
(You know what else) You're shaped like a thistle
The holes in your drawers when you fuck been there since
You duckin suckin motherfuckin cold-hearted faggot
Sperm germs on your worm DISINTEGRATED MAGGOTS
Repeat your rhymes all the time like a FUCKIN' parrot
Phony gold chains only rated two carats
You tell your friends that your home is like heaven
Livin' in the gutter sewer seven pipe eleven
You wear your socks twelve days in a row
Turn them on the other side so the dirt won't show
Go to school, take a shit, don't wipe your ass
Claimin on another sucka nigga in your class
You wanna battle?
Is it the pork on your fork, or the swine on your mind
Make you rap against a brother with a weak-ass rhyme
Swine on your mind, pork on your fork
Make you imitate the brother in the state of New York
Chain on your BRAIN, that drove you inSANE
When you tried to CLAIM, for the talent and the FAME
Not in the GAME, yet and still you CAME
Suffer the PAIN, as I demolish your NAME
Not like Betty Crocker, baking cake in the OV
Sayin' this is dedicated to the one I love
Not a swine or dove, from the heaven's up above
When I rap, people CLAP, so the pushers they shove
When I rhyme I get LOOSE, better than Mother Goose
Rock the mic day and NIGHT, so you see I'm the JUICE
Like the two-six-EIGHT, politicians demonstrate
Now hold up hold up hold up hold up
What y'all niggaz don't seem to hear
Is y'all can not FUCK with me
I saiiiiiiiiiid
Alllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Can't FUCK with me
I wanna give a shout out to my nigga Door, Door, Door
Buddha Monk, Buddha Monk, Buddha Monk
Yo, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack
For the niggaz who's here
And the girls who's out there
Throw your hands in the air
Cause this one is more fly
Fly, fly
Fly, fly
Flyyyyyyyyahhahayhahhhha
Bzzzzt
Woo!
Get your ass in the house boy, I told you
Get your ass in the house! Get, get, in the god damn house boy!

I wanna stay high in the clouds
I wanna keep plenty of pussy around
I'm gonna keep puttin' in bullets in pocket
Just in case, it's goin' down
I'm a Brooklyn soldier, yes, I'm is
If you lookin' for a problem, here it is
I'm worser than the cross and bones, and that's danger
I don't give a fuck, what beef it is
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Now I'mma get serious, pussy don't talk, went the heat come out
Niggaz sleep on Dirty, till the street come out
I like fame, but lockdown changed the nigga
Now it's all about the gauge, on the stage for nigga
'Cause haters wanna shoot, everything that shine
So I'm prepared, to lock and load my rhymes
Eat, two at a time, while my mind is bent
And dare motherfucker, come with Brook' with that
I be rollin' on the Boulevard, nothin' better rush
I'm like Big Ben with my middle finger up
Sidewalk hash, make thugs relax
Got a team that could vile your habitat
More gritty than Diddy, cause my hair's uncombed
Streets I roam, are too hot to throw on poems
Feel like L.A. blocks, home, when the yay is yo
Gotta rob a motherfucker when the day is slow

Uh, pussy doctor, four-four cocker
Platinum, baby, y'all niggaz is goin' copper
I'm down in Bad Boy South with the nigga Chopper
Programmed to blow shit up, like Dennis Hopper
Hella pointed, hop out the helicopter
It's L.A.X. for the weed, it's hella proper
I rap, but still stick hoes for door knockers
And if she's persistent, block her, block her, block her
Infered, I call it the show shocker
It's M.S.G., with Jay-Z, the show stopper
And this is for them gangsta dudes, know you boppin'
That take dough, and don't take shorts for no coppers
My team are life stoppers, watch me split ya life up

And just for doing the thing, they try to lock us

Of dimepiece, model type bitches, who mind they business
Blow my dick, like birthday cake wishes

I'm tired of this shit, remember the time I told y'all
When I got burnt, gonorrhea
Well this bitch, there's a new bitch goddamnit
Oh, bitch burnt me again with gonorrhea
So I didn't get burnt one time I got burnt actually two times
When you really look at it
Yeah, I love the girl but I had to cut the bitch off
Yeah the bitch died, I killed the bitch
She suffered a long pain bitchy ass go bitch had to go
I I knew the bitch for ten minutes of her life
But the pussy was good! Yes the pussy was good!
I just want you to know girl!
That I dedicated, this song, well this song really was written
By Blowfly, and I want all y'all to hear this shit
It's just a poem that I writ for you girl
*Paper crinkles*
*Singing*
The first time, ever you sucked my dick
Thank you thank you!
I felt, the earth tremble, under my balls
Somethin' shot out of me real fast
First time

How y'all feelin', listen to the album 'cause it's BANGIN'
We have only thirty-five chambers, there is no thirty-six
I know that, but, I want to create a new chamber
Oh? And what would that be?"

Turn it up!
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
One nigga, two nigga, three nigga, four
One of you niggaz is about to get fucked up
It's the Ol' Dirt McGirt, live and uncut
Live and uncut, ready to bust some nut
Like when I first came home, I boned Simone
Fucked her so hard, pussy started to groan
Seven in the morn', woked up and yawned
The bitch scrambled my eggs, she wrote me a song
(Sing it!) It's all because of Dirt Dog
That the reason I took my skirt off
You went away -- now I'm back with The Roc
And this is where the bullshit stop
Plus these voices in my head, want me to go back
Pick up your guns, don't take your Prozac
Ritalin, Codelin, Zoloft, cocaine
Wu-Tang, nigga, it's the new John Coltrane
(Chorus: girl (Ol' Dirty Bastard))
Dirt Dog, Dirt Dog, you our man
If you can't do it, then no one can
(Mr. McGirt, gonna get you dirty
Lift up yah skirt, I'm gonna get you dirty)
Dirt Dog, Dirt Dog, you our man
If you can't do it, then no one man
(It's The Roc in the house, gonna get you dirty
The Wu-Tang Clan gonna get you dirty)
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Enough to make a nigga, go crazy
Shut down the Grammy's, ask my grammy
Wu-Tang for the kids, but your host can't stand me
Wu-Tang for the kids, bust them off for family
Catch me on Disney (ma, who is he?)
Down Dirty, stinky, grime and grizzly
Old man McGirt, lookin' under your skirt
Fucked the pussy till it's orange, like Ernie and Bert
Like, ooh, nigga, I'm burnin' up
She said, ooh, nigga, I'm burnin' up
Meth got the weed, we can burn it up
I told the D.J., nigga, turn it up
I want a girl that help me take my medication
Or I don't end up at the police station
I don't wanna go back to the police station
They tried to send Dirt on a long vacation"

Do or die"" throughout intro*
(What's your move bitch nigga?)
Suttin' ain't goin' down like that
I ain't lettin' niggas know they ain't know
(How you gonna get what you ain't got?
You know what I'm sayin'?) You ain't gonna get it
(Yeah) That's the way it's goin' down
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Fuckin' around
{Yo I mastered the art of Shadowboxin'!}
(Chorus x2: Popa Chief)
Do or die, ball or fly
Lintballz always hangin' around tryin' to get high
But fuck sittin' around waitin' on a hook up
It's time to turn the heat up
And catch these papes like cooked up
What?
(12 O'Clock)
Niggas waitin' for hook up, get shook up
Never get your weight off and do a push up
You smokin' all my purple kush up
Don't make me push and rook up
Get you touched up, I lift my wrist up, yup, yup
Now niggas know Lil' Diggs, only twice wore a suit
Had sex in a group with a couple of bitches dance for loot
See I'ma tell them niggas about spendin' all they loot
Partyin' and trickin' on bitches and don't recoup
I got my own version of roots
Cracker ass nigga pickin' cotton and polishin' my Brooklyn Zoo boots
The new news is Brooklyn Zoo
Sunz and Two On Da Road, Blue, Crazy Cuffie Fam too
(Prodical)
Yo, I ain't tryin' to be on no forever broke shit
So I made myself eatin' these streets where blood leak
Me and my whole fleet smoke trees, blow heat, roll unique
Do or die tactics, and keep us sharp on our feet, meak
And all we do is make classics, CCF, the Unit
Dirt Dog, the Zoo, Ghetto Government, get your ratchet
95% of them niggas is faggots, and I've had it up to here
See our face this year, appear
On your TV screen, we stay green
Money makes the world go around, know what I mean-ean?
New team, fresh and clean clean on your scene
Now sing along, sing along, y'all know the theme-heme

Yeah, bitches wanna bone a nigga when your records is sellin'
Labels don't play a nigga when they nuttin' but felons
Young Razah got that hot shit that's under the Heavens
GG'z poppin' grey goose feathers
Prostitute cheddar, crashin' in whips with new leathers
Bad models be on the dick that shy and strip
Thinkin' we some gangsters, thugs, Bloods or Crips
Watch who you sleep, shake hands and hustle with
Why dream to be rich when I'm already rich?
Two bars I spit got the hottest nigga pissed
Chicks kiss the diamonds that twist on our wrist
Brooklyn Zoo, S.O.M., Dirty Bast' shit, nigga
(Ol' Dirty Bastard (Buddha Monk))
I whip a nigga ass on hand and hand, you get flashed
Whatever you do, I stop your ass

I kill you with my motherfuckin' piss
A matter of fact you kill yourself, nigga I crash ya stealth
(See let a nigga come through with that bullshit)
Yeah we ain't sayin' nuttin'

I loved that shit till it's bloody
(Buddha Monk)
Hey yo hold up, you told me you liked that shit muddy and swampy
And you gonna hit it from where (from the back door)
This Fam right here, is the Fam right here
And if you fuck with the Zoo you gon' get clapped right there
For this CREAM nigga, I'll walk through Muddy Waters
If he be call out, and rob your son and daughter
Lintballz in my pocket and yours is real lumby
Nah, Lay Down, gimme what you got G
Split the pie three ways, live off it for three days
And when it's done, who's the next victim today
I'm trife nigga, and I don't live by BIBLE life
I yap the nigga ripe then stash a nigga right
Yeah I did wanna do it and the Devil didn't make me
Linballz in my pocket that made me stick them G'z
Checkmate, pray to the Lord, your soul He take
Then I hip into the rob for my Fam I just got 'im, nigga

You doin' what you doin', let's get it

Hit 'em where the good Lord split him
Introduce myself, go booth yourself
In the far left lane, and I'm, hydro planned
And I'm, slingin' my 'caine, don't care how you feel
Checkin' out the truck, check the wheels
Wanna get fucked, bitch kneel, let me splash in your grill
Who but me? Muthafuckin' right, get it right
Papi of this motherfuckin' thing, truck tight
Rollin' with my niggaz, we ain't lookin' for no fights
Now pop one in your head, that's all she said
It's time to get head in my Mercedes-Benz
Chipped up and I ain't even talkin' bout my jams
Clipped up, so any nigga frontin', gettin' banned
Give 'em all ten in his chin, I'm all in
(Chorus 4X: Meeno)
Move back, move back, you can't fuck with me, huh
I'm from the click called N.I.B
(Meeno)
Next up, I believe that's me
Meeno, get it right, no descrempancy
Always keep a weapon, see, run it ground
Worth of stones, nothin' less on me, why you stress on me
Niggaz mad 'cause I stretch my D., y'all dudes want my recipe?
Here's what y'all do, hit the lab, write an album or two
Then I might let you sign my shoe, that's just how I do
Everybody sayin', boy too souped up
Nah, I'm just hot, plus Bentley Coup'd up
Who put, you too busy holdin' the stoupe up
Y'all fault your broke, and not mine, stupe'a
I'm like Juve', I need it in my life
Got fifty birds flyin' in, later on tonight
Rock and I hustle, so I get paid twice
Life is a gamble boy, roll your dice
(Tony Wink)
Who you know spit flows, get dough like I
In the L.A.B.'s, motherfucker, no lie
Hit the links I've seen, back in late '95
Had to wait for two nine, rockin' and clickin' on both sides
Of course we gon' ride, ride over the competition
The real has arrived, y'all bitch niggaz is finished
All I gotta do is Nextel tag my lieutenant
Your whole click will get toe tagged tagged in two minutes
This to them fools thinkin' they gon' catch the God slippin'
I'm always on point and I'm always packin' my weapon
You see me in the club, believe me, I got the tech in
I slipped the DJ a guard, you slipped it in with the records
Either you love it or hate it, but bet you gon' respect it
Rainbow glow, when the lights hit off the necklace
I'm what you can't be, young, black, rich, and wreckless
It's the god free, and L.A.B.'s, one two, check it

Remix! Huh, yeah, it's 101, what?
You know what it is when you hear that, Harlem
Fix ya face or smacked in it, Harlem

You gonna only look like a hater, huh-huh
Lenox Ave. Boyz, what up, it's only right
They know what it is, man, remix

Move back, its no touchin' me, I'm from that place called NYC
H Dub to the death, and I don't give a fuck what party it is
I'm still in the club wearin' sweats (hah)
Milk ears with the money colored check
Ill two step, blowin' dubs with the best
Live life, most hated, with my Lenox Ave. Boyz
Remix, Move Back, with Grease providing all the noise
Huh, your home boy game so raw
And I ain't even gotta say my name no more
Haters wanna give my name to the law
But punchin' and kickin', to kick us all, they can blame you for
Might catch me in the 'Lac with Snaps
Or lightin' sticky green 'dro, with Wink and Meeno
You from the hood and you ain't no coward, well me neither
And before you step on my sneaker, I really think you need to (move back, move
Back)
(Drag-On)
This your boy to the dash
Same nigga, no talkin', just result to the mass
I stab niggaz, throw the hawk in the trash
Peroxide my bullets, give the burners a bath
Three fifty Z, burnin' the Ave
I'm old school, I still got the fiends burnin' the glass
I pull the pump off my waist, and dumb in your face
I'm a little bit too hard for the radios to play
I still can spit eighty miles an hour in a verse
And my Coupe go eighty miles an hour in reverse
I let my tool go, y'all niggaz just studio killas
Nigga, I'mma killa in the studio
I got guns that'll hollow a wall
Point it to your jaw, make you swallow it all
Y'all niggaz want hardcore?
What the fuck you think the R, and Full Surface and D-Block is for?
(Cardan)
They ask, who's that, that's P-Cardi
And what he in, what he in, he in a Fer-rari
You know I'm strapped, you know I'm strapped, I got the heat on me
And what I'm wearin', and what I'm wearin', a long Bigari
Thinkin' I'm Joe Clark, nigga, try to 'lean on me'
But if he is, like Biggie said, 'he gon' bleed'
Niggaz ain't hard, niggaz heart full of creatine
But go against that, green, I go against your, brain
And don't fuck with me and the kid, I've been a daddy all my life
No 'dro, we gon' blow that alley all day, say what
Act stupid, we gon' it crackin' here tonight
Greasin', Meen' on the front, with Snappy on my right
If rap don't work, nigga, we go to the kitchen
Those ain't hoes, so then you know we ain't pimpin'
I'm on, my toes, so nigga, no, I ain't slippin'
Too close, hold somethin', or now I know Cardy didn't
(Terra Blacks)
And if he know, what keep me little
Think you know, I think it later
See me, and my guns come to, just like a waiter
You up north, singin' just like Anita Baker
Make up your mind, then come and ready, feen to meet your maker
The man that laugh last, will surely laugh harder
Me have a gonna shut up and eat bars, and all of the prankster
With them and I for black gangster (huh, I'm from the click called N.I.B.)
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
But drunk, when he hop inside, in the club gettin' tired
Bitches scatter all around me, ready to excite it
All these kittens got me flea bitten, eatin' out my mitten
I'm comin' off top, my moves are unwritten
Now slitter to the snake, in the spring time wither
But strong on my own, Wu-Tang, I'm forever
Women desirin', jobs is hiring
Money admiring, never keep tiring
Rhymin' ain't nothin', the easiest job ever
And I'm doing mine, holdin' it together
While money quadruple, from playin' the cripple
Drinkin' from a titty nipple, sippin' on ripple
Blunt keep on flippin', from keep gettin' dippin'
The mic I'm rippin', the record skippin'
The pussy drippin', the wet got me slippin'
The bitch I'm strippin', I'm platinum shippin'"

Yo! Met this bitch by the name of Subie
She was a bad bitch, she had a big ol' booty
She got me setting up when I went to the projects
Bad ass bitch she was the one to holla at
Had another bitch by the name of Pricilla
You know that bad bitch, she taste like vanilla
In my car looking good like that
Getting money, making records, down with rap
Saying to myself, no one can defeat me
I got my dick out, c'mon bitch beat me!
Let that shit out, go down your throat
Nigga like me, never miss a note
If rain I got coats so I can't get soaked
Make a nigga know I take's that dough
Get high like Supa Fly
I'm the best, that's the shit now I don't know why

Bitch please! Come live out your fantasies
Dollars and diamonds, like on my Ice Creams
1K jeans wit belt and white tee
I sling white balls give fiends a pipe dream
Well in this scene in my british queen
The ignition's on the left but yes it's the right theme
Engine full of horses, chariots the king
The B's in the middle like it's tittie fucking the wings
Pornographic, the voice so drastic
Without a +Reasonable Doubt+ I'm +classic+
Cake-aholic the same way - that Dame Dash is
But I bakes my cakes, bag 'em up in plastic (UHH!)
Halloween 'em up, trick yeah I treat 'em up

She so fine, all she need now is a baller
Who better fit the bill? I myself, I'm a starter
In the game, you could tell by the charter
G4, Lear, or the Yacht in the harbor
Mama come to papa, don't it feel at home here?
All the comforts of it, you ain't got a care
Don't love me wit your heart, love me from a far
Now sit, look pretty like you came wit the car
Diamonds in the ear lobe, wrapped in the mink
Condo chillin', I be tickle pink
Not worrying 'bout the next bitch or what people think
If I say they don't exist, POOF the extinct
Mama - no! we don't need the drama
All we need is south beach, puffing on Habanas
You just strike a match girl, do your man a honors

See let a nigga come through with that bullshit
Anytime you pop that shit nigga
I'ma tell you you can suck a dick, you can suck a pussy
I know, it'll come to what? Say what?
Now I'ma let all you motherfuckers know
See them knows that this is something you can't fuck
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
Always
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck, where you be motherfucker!
Where you reside... motherfucker! How you live? How you seeeeeeee...
Sort the stack outs, this one's the blackout
Three-fifty-seven to your mouth, blaaow!

Dunn can you hear me? Raw is how I'm inflicting this
It's that G type slang that makes this real sickening
Ignite my styles I got my hand pon the trigger
Starts from the smallest and hits the bigger nigga

Yo, straight actin' live about them hellfires
A known mental killer, or thriller, assassin of terror

Through the valley of sin, I step to ville and murdered many man
Serving justice in my vicinity

Yo! Niggaz grab the mic like the bites of a scorpion
Nervous, that's why the Zoo brought me in

Before the case begin, first break me in
His brain! And make sure he can't maintain the calmness
Ya harmless, watch how I bomb this
Stage like, mail, pre hands that be the move
Now your Posse is your fuckin' Platoon
Stale cells, just flows through the air
I'm like a ninja, once I send ya down stairs
Then I get furious, imperious, the lyricist
With the cleverest rhyme
Erupt to deduct your fuckin' mind
(12 O'Clock - Brooklyn Zu)
Fuck shit up on the hurry-up
Known for burying ducks through more styles than a muck
Warning you chump, brain is out for lunch
Given the power punch, soon to be paid like Donald Trump
Never fall victim to no bitch
Jerked my dick, but still got more hoes than a pimp
And score more points than Shawn Kemp
Keepin' powerfully strong like the center on the Knicks
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut!

And tell her Shorty Shit Stain sent it

You shoulda stayed HOME instead of picking up a microphone
But if you wanna run on up, like you TOUGH
I call your bluff, and blow you down with my hardcore
Stuff, I shine like twenty-four carat

Test my skill niggaz, you're trippin'
Drugged up from sniffin, you're the one who's riffin
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
Start to flip, slip, 'cause you're slippin
While you sleep I be the God on point, with Scottie Pippen
As I, jump on stage, flip rip a show
Strip and rip a hoe, way like Bo
Jackson while I'm still taxin maxin
Relaxin sittin' back sellin good tracks and
Again and again when I rock the jam
WANNA SEE EM UP IN THE AIR! Throw up your hand
Introducin, one-man band in town
It's wild, with the style couldn't stand nigga
When the jump, stepped, to the center

Your ass that's your ass, on a whore shot

'Cause the friend's coming with her, and she can participate
After Mardi Gras, I meet 'em in titty bars
Take 'em home, and bend 'em, and fill 'em with Dirty long
Cock strong dick diesel, when I stand like an easel
Come sit on Mini Me, and put a smile on Dr. Evil
Got some sunshine, leavin' my girl behind

Wicked women puttin' period blood in stew
Don't that make the stew witches' brew?
I fear for the eighty-five that don't got a clue

I'm known on the microphone as the rap professor
Casual dresser, you may dress fresher
The way that I speak this shit is energetic
Rhyme physique of me is quick atheletic
Remove all MC's who disapprove
That my funky fresh particle always have the groove
You're jealous over me because you're not a competitor
You're just a donor, I'm the rap editor
Tryin' to rock the mic when you get an appetite
All negative on the mic, I dislike
Try to rock the mic but only will reduce
Try to get loose, you juice as a youth
Not knowin' to yourself that you shall be frozen
I'm the MC warrior, who has been chosen
To rock and shock beats, polite when I recite
Softcore MC's, you are down right, out right
Try to be talkative, there's no alternative
Hide until I forgive, this motive
I am unique with the perfected physique
The objective of my rhyme is my own technique
I maintain the paradise on this Earth
With the shut the fuck up style for what this shit is worth
Watch a nigga catch a purse
Super-hero niggaz die
Do my dirt, get away and multiply
You bitches, ya nice guys
Always want bitch, because ya need mine

'Cause nobody can't fuck with me!
You bootleggin buyin motherfuckers, don't do that with me
With all these child-support cases I got, I needs my money!
Girls from the ages, a 100 and down, sacrifice ya baby to the underground
The best kept secret, how does it feel to be
Boxed in like a skeleton, growin' back ya skin?
When I was young, I was taught how to produce
The science of babies gettin' loose
I turned white boys to Springsteen spruce
Black to spooks, gave the Chinese Bruce
I can't help it if my style is foggy, monster boogie
Get ya high on my patio, all come to see me movie
Bicthes, you're walkin' on my dirt
We ain't sayin' nothin'

He was known as the snake spirit
He had the speed of a snake
Intro/Verse One: Killah Priest
Niggaz is like serpents out there
(Snake style, no one could compete)
Serpents will bite
Lay outside, and then they roll back into they holes
They slither, in the streets of Brooklyn, New York
Slither in the streets, of Manhattan
In the streets of Queens, streets of the Bronx
Streets of Staten Island
Wherever you see 'em they slither
Whoever... yo
Fearsome shit... check it out
Yo, yo
It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong 'cause his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin dice and gettin' nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve, and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He was just stagger, smellin like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin, how he was fuckin' mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standin when the nigga started bustin'
Blood started to flood the floors, by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw
Damn, we plan to make grands of our home
(Number two)
Verse Two: The RZA
Jagged edge, rockin' God, hard as Stonehenge
Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge...
...Hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manor
And on the block he was called by the momma's and the grandma's
Indecent, heathen, juvenile delinquent
His weekends was frequently, locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin papes
Was snatchin up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang 'em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin rocks and duckin from the sirens
Greetin niggaz he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggaz be lookin' out
Hopin he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House
In PC, on a liquid diet, but he was louder than a riot
(Number two, the snake)
Verse Three: Masta Killa
Do the knowledge to a nigga named Trigga
Bad rude boy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S.
To receive the gold that he couldn't achieve
In his country, even though he sold mad weed
For the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggaz actin' like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
At the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the CREAM
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggaz I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries wounds and burns
Walkin' through the streets of Medina I stand firm
'Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
Without a doubt, niggaz who front, get snuffed out
Justice must be born there's no escape
Cause a snake can't be reformed so I wait
Comin' in the name to proclaim your fame for protection
And you don't know no fuckin' lessons?
(Number two, the snake)
Verse Four: Ol Dirty Bastard
Bad, bad, Leroy Brown
Baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than the deep blue seaaaaa
Badder than you and meeeeee
Niggaz comin' through the trees, like a salamander, bitin
Like a piranha, but I'm bitin you back, like a black pantha
The style I'm ampin the... fuck my name, who I be?
Fuck the game, it's all about the money!
Owahhaerah, sometimes I get high with the Meth
Then I turn to the Killah Priest
When it comes TWELVE O'CLOCK!
I turn into the demon beast, yo
Yo fuck that shit!
(Number two, the snake)
Yo! show these motherfuckers what time it is
(Number two, the snake) Rawwrarrrah
Rahhwarwaahauh, rawwaroar!
WHOSE THE BAD-ASS? *rawharrah*
Whose the bad-ass?
(Now number two) Rawwwaahrah
(He practiced the snake style
He was known as the snake spirit) Yeah
Verse Five: Buddha Monk
Lyrics, never waitin, twelve days, penetrated
When I come with the ruffness, mad niggaz try to rush this
Slip into my killings, then I slays and you're helpless
When I try to stay sick, it's yacub grafted six
Calm for the kill, knowing the style that's ill
When I drop, lyric skills, brothers say, Buddha chill!
Outro: Ol Dirty Bastard
I don't need to rhyme no more, niggaz know, yo!
To all the Wu-Tang Clan members

Appear bizarre, Ol' Dirty boulevard

Got babies like caviar, growin' evening star
God bless the dead, Tupac Shakur
You can't divide war, this slim galore
Arabian flow, at nine a gigolo
With a bad hot hoe, only cocaine up the nose
Incognito, defeat me, how so?

Made me blow, on rap radio (Wu, Wu)

Brooooklyyyyyyyyyyn Zu, came through with the baby blue
Me and my brother Dirt Dog
Mama made breakfast today, with no hog
We hustle in the street, niggaz ain't fuckin' with Wu, so roll deep
Born God Body with the vest of heat
When the Bee Sting hit, niggaz move they feet
Yo, we banned from the club, you best to not sleep
Keep somethin' on the waves, thug passion with the Alize's
Smack 85 percenters, right in they face
On some black pimpin' shit, like my dun-dun Huey
God Squad in the building, big bags of ooey
Push the phat shit like Dutch Tsasui
RZA bring all the shit, fuck these clowns

Sing the song, sing the song with me
When I'm with you baby, tell me why, tell me so
I ask you to go high, you tell me to go low
So I go low, [slurp], taste the shit
[Slurp], taste it again, I like it
[Rrr] I'm the original G-O-D
Making young ladies scream's my specialty
When I go DUN DUN DUN DUH, girls get hype
From the funky fresh music that was stereotyped
When I kill, that ol' mad funky flow
Not sayin' Ason, duck duck disco
Or disco duck, strictly hip hop
Baby baby, I can't stop
Wu, gots ta like come on through
So, that's the call for the Wu
I came here to rectify
BROOKLYN ZOO, terrify
Why, niggas wanna get up and rap and rap and rap
Man, fuck that
Shit, that I make it's the skit
I wanna see ya hands in the air, can ya dig it
Let's sing the song
Come on party people, all in together now, sing along
Have you ever ever ever
In your long legged life
Had a bald headed bitch
For your bald headed wife
[Laughter] Gimme dat
Who's the baddest motherfucka in the Brooklyn town
And also representer of the Wu-Tang sound
If you wanna get up and get fucked up
Last nigga got up and got shot up
But you's a gangsta, on the boards I'll bang ya
Mess with the Wu-Tanger, I'll hang ya
You'll get shanked and spanked and alley-ooped
I admire true niggas like Dre and Snoop
Chamber number 9, verse 32
Only speaks about BROOKLYN ZOO
That a true nigga shall come through
No one is available to be compatible
This is chamber number 9, verse 32
Is what we call The Stomp

The stomp is down [Stomp]
Get down for your crown [Stomp]
Stomp [Stomp]

Brothas always playin' with the microphone
When it blows up in your face, [BOOM] you leave it alone
You couldn't touch, this style is too much
It's the rhymer, I don't give a crippled crab crutch
[Grruh] Any nigga or niggerette
Get burned to the brimecell like a cigarette
Straight up and down, I don't play around
Rhymin gets me paid madd bread by the pound
Shout out to my crew, tight as a belt y'all
Go by the name Big A, from the shelter"

Who can make it happen like Dirt?
Bury motherfuckers like Dirt?
A Dirty for drama, get's worse
Who can make it happen like Dirt?, tell me
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Standin' over bodies with a shovel
Standin' over bad, till my beef all settle
On another level, 'cause I dance with the Devil
Then I slap a bitch in the eye, with the bezzle
Starin' at ice, so my nine stare back
Then I shoot first, so you won't shoot back
Criminal thoughts, sippin' on Similac
If I walk with a limp, then it's pimp tag scrap
On sundown, you gonna eat these rounds
Roll on the bitch ass, with the tops dropped down
Dirty stay focused on the bend, deep nigga
Then I will offend, who offend me, nigga
(Chorus 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Who can make it happen like Dirt?
Bury motherfuckers like Dirt?
When the cavalry come, and you face these guns
Who can make it happen like Dirt?
(Ol' Dirty Bastard)
If you sittin' beside me in the church
One hand on the bible, on hand on your purse
Fuckin' the deacon's wife, like I'm Judas
Y'all thank God, while me and my stank, do this
Had her online like desktop computers
We ran the train, like rush hour commuters
Pack a pussy, like porn stars, yeah, y'all
Who can make it happen, Dirt Dog, the rock star
Bury motherfuckers who come, so stay far
I can send a bullet back to when, y'all start war
Who can make it happen like Dirt?
Who can get it clappin' like Dirt?
Who can make it happen like Dirt?
(Chorus 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Who can make it happen like Dirt?
Bury motherfuckers like Dirt?
When the cavalry come, and you face these guns
Who can make it happen like Dirt?"

I'm out of jail, nigga, I'm out of jail

Go and get the fuck out, I'mma pull
One of your muthafucka's eye, ah, something
Dirt McGirt, muthafucka
Y'all know who I am, what?
Dirt McGirt, baby, whose the man?
What part you fools don't understand
Been away now, I'm back by popular demand
Ain't a damn thing changed, nigga, back up
First nigga to act up, get smacked up
Orange suits on hand, Dirty this, Dirty that
Yo, where Dirty at? But now Dirty back
My girl is nasty, her booty is stank
I fucked her all night, until a nigga shoot blanks
Doggystyle, will never spill my drink
Then smoke a blunt, and watch the shit on tape
You can sit on my face, I like the taste
If my P.O. call, tell that bitch to wait
I break ya face, invade your space
Don't make the mistake, tell me who is in the place what?
(Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard)
Yeah, let me see you work something
Slow down, don't hurt nothing
You nasty, ain't ya? You freaky, ain't ya?
Get ya ass over here, shake it like ya just don't care
Now bounce-bounce, move it over here, now
Work, work, move it over here
History, I do her, then we split up
Lyon call, whenever, we ready to get up
I ain't never been hit up, with a line that's strong
Have a nigga fuck the shit up, with his love, that's wrong
Got a hell of a body, yeah, I love that tone
And god damn, I love that moan
There's just something about you, make a nigga stay all night long
My undercover freak the shit
It's cool, 'cause her peeps was rich
So whatever I want covered, and she got my peeps' pitch right
So when I'm on the road, or a girl play the show
She can respect homebase, she play the codes
Nasty as she wanna be, shaking that ass right in front of me
Can't seem to keep her from up under me
And how I am, try'nna see if chirp gash
Shake it for the Gunnerz and Dirt, shh...
I'm dirty, just like the dirty south
I talk dirty, wash out my dirty mouth
I'm dirty, just like the dirty south
Talk dirty, wash out my dirty mouth
What, nigga? Why you wanna get me started?
Got me in the club with Tha Alkaholiks
On the down low, like I'm ducking the warrant
Getting head in the back by the bathroom toilet
There's beauty all around, let me see the performance
She down for whatever, you know I'mm all for it
Gotta spark hard, hoppin' sports bar
After this, it's the Marriot courtyard
Gold card, I'mma max it out
Just keep your titties shaking and the apples out
You can, stick around, honey, that's no doubt
Bust a nut, then I'm passing out"

Whatever you say is a mirage
And on top of that, huh, nigga fuck y'all
I'm the law of the land, got girls Uncle Nuggah

You couldn't jump jump jump
You couldn't punk, you couldn't funk funk funk the shit up

Millimeter, shoot you up, bust you up (Fuck fuck, What?)
I drop an ambulance on a nigga
Mad trucks, runnin' over niggas
I love bitches, when they front on they pussycat
You ain't gettin' over like a fat rat
Hate is the method, killin' all you savages
You won't be sendin' me messages
I put your nigga on pause, I keep that shit on
Destroy you through your whores
'Cause you ain't never had clout
You niggas on a rat drought

Suck my dick!

I'll grab and the mic and now I damage you, cut your whole stamina
Here comes the medical examiner
One verse then you're out for the count
(Bring the ammonia) make sure he sniffs the right amount
Wake him up and then I ask him
Why did he intend this --
Competition to get an ass kickin so tremendous
Boy you shouldn't bother this
Leave me alone like the (son said G or he'll be fatherless!)
I got the asiatic flow mixed with disco
Roll up on the scene like the Count of Monte Crisco
And MC's start to vanish
(I stepped up to a jet black kid, started speakin' Spanish!
Yo he wasn't from Panama
I asked him how he get so dark, the nigga said suntama!
He responded so fast, you made me laugh)
Ha-ha-ha, HARARRRH (then I scared-his ass!)
(Kick the hundred strongest rhymes
I brought out the punk in him
Caught him with a strong five deadly venom
Told him enter the Wu-Tang
Witness the Shaolin slang, that'll crush the shit you bring)
I watch your ass take a big fall, why?!
My Main Source, is like a friendly game of stickball
And as you step up to bat man (I play the riddler)
You try to do me for a rhyme (then I'll change to Hitler)
Go out like Nazi; you'll be wishin your fuckin' ass
Stayed home and played (Yahtzee!)
Or watchin Happy Days sweatin (Poxie)
With Ralphie and Richie Cunningham, Joni and (Chachi)
Wu, who? Me gettin' wreck so I'm through
Like a ten and a half foot, gettin' in a seven (shoe)
(Now picture THAT with a Minolta)
Have your ass doin' some Night Fever shit like John Travolta
I come strong I make knowledge born, I flip the script
And rock on from P.M. (past the fucking Dawn)
Pass the Hammer you're broke down, niggaz grab my what what
Can't understand it here's the panaroma
(A complete view of how I defeat you)
Should of stepped to those fuckin' kids who tried to (beat you)
Yeah I bust that ass before

And want to perform a massacre
Better be coming with some motherfucking shit that's spectacular
Crush the person who did em, well you just better
So I'm stepping to your (raggedy ass jetta)
Put the pedal to the metal
You and your DJ change your name to Ma and Pa Kettle
As I (pass the bone, kicks your every measure)
It's not a Newport but it's still live with pleasure
(C'mon don't be silly, just a bag of sensimilli
Rolled up in a) Motown Philly

Grab the mic, then I kinda like went for broke
With visually concepts strongest rhymes and biceps
Lyrically speakin', three to four rhymes then choke
Some think they be harmin this, claimin they be bombin this)
But they still remains a-nom-ynous
I pull strings like Jimi Hendrix
Ride more beats that go backs to the days of Eddie Kendricks
I teach the truth to the youth, I say (hey youth)
Here's the truth, better start wearing (bullet proof)
Arm yourself with a shield
(Before you get trapped up) just like the Children in the Cornfield"
