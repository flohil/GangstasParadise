Uh ... 1 2 1 2 ...
Sometimes I see the uh
(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
Sometimes I see the world for how fucked up it really is
I tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
Then I couldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows though
Get a pay check, spend it all on polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe though
Now I'm dressin' so expensive, for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'
I got a family, can't afford a coat
So I leave a little paper there before I go
Spend a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
Made me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just tryna set you free
Remember love, if you can't, remember me
Dear people on earth after I die, what's the weather like?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and I ain't perfect but I try
Hey, I wonder if I'll maybe get a second life
This time I'm a get it right
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
It's either God or the devil with these drugs I'm on
I don't know if we were meant to see it all like this
Still, plantin' seeds so my money long
Money addict, it's a habit that palms gon' itch
I wish we could just all get rich
Sometimes not havin' money is all I miss
And yet these hoes that roll up on my dick
The all American girl, that's just a blond head bitch
Am I supposed to have some thoughts like this?
Could we figure out what God might've miss?
It's funny that these questions never get an answer
Life a bitch sometimes you got to reprimand her
Never understand her, why should I even try?
Live forever then you never feel the need to die
This a letter, open it to set you free
Remember love and remember me
What does it mean to be a sensation? Do you have to be sensational?
And how you know you made it?
When you're with Killa Cam, watchin' Paid in Full
I never had good grades in school but, shock the world is what I came to do
I got a song I wanna play for you, so can you sing that back to me?

I could sell evil to the devil
Nonbelievers to a temple
Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat
And these eyes is iconic
I went pro, made profit
Now I keep some dead face in my pocket
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Breezing my weed, easing my mind
Why you worry about me?
Stop tripping, I'm fine
Swear these bitches done lost it lately

2,5 O'Clock,2009,The High Life (2009),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest
It's (5 o'clock in the mornin')
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
But I'm going hard till there's nothing left under my chest
The streets empty 'round 5 o'clock
Driving by the cops
Low key microscopic till the eyes that watch
Everything a hustle when you tryin' come buy some guap
I'mma keep grindin' till I'm still shining like a diamond watch
Me and boo here bringing you the truth
With all night sessions we just living in the booth
Strong balls like we spitting out 150 proof
Take shots get loose till you spitting up yo' food (like oh)
You see 'dat I'mma need a recap
Grab a weed sack cheap that till my feet flat
I got this covered like a pro bowl d-back
Breathe rap been a been known to make the b-clip
Need cash so I'm tryin' to move some trees fast
Tell you where to meet at
Ask you where the cheese at
People 'round the city see the youngin' and respect the grind
Puttin' in th extra time
Guaranteed next to shine
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest
It's (5 o'clock in the mornin')
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
But I'm going hard till there's nothing left under my chest
(Boaz)
I rise before the sun come up and get my day started
Pray to the most how I roll up my hays and spark it
And then my paper starts to roll in
Money in paper bags
Hammers with laser tags
We grown men
Out on the corner till the early morn'
The blood of a hustla gettin' mines before I was born
You get stormed by these tight ass bars
From being easy Mac
Crusin' in lax smokin' weed with no season at
There ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us (why?)
Except these labels anticipating and waiting on us
They get the BBS's radios play us
Then we blaze in the Benz's
And sit this off on BBS's
And from P.A to Texas
These niggas know about me
International hustla can't get no snow without me
Or get no dough without me
Niggas gettin' hardly stackin' on 'er
Early bird get the worm
I'm knockin' at the cracker dome
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress
A marathon grind like I'm running from rest
It's (5 o'clock in the mornin')
Somebody told me sleep was a cousin to death
And following a dollar finds nothing but stress

3,A Million Dollars,2009,The High Life (2009),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, Imma make a million
Bitch please, Imma make a million 'cause
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, Imma make a million
With ease, Imma make a million
A lotta times I don't get the credit
Forgettin about my ethical work
Let it be first said that I'm here to earn bread
I been dedicatin' ever since I turned head
Got the type of style quickly gonna turn heads
I been workin', part time hustla
Hit you wit a dub feedin bubblas
Got this brah
On the road with a dollar and a dream
'Cause anything is possible, believe bitch please
It ain't nothin' to spit, sparkin up in the whip
Stayin stuck up on my dreams like they rubber cement
No one ever sees a legend when he stuck on the bench
And my screw's so loose it'll fuck up your wrench
My head can't contain all these dreams of mine
When I'm rich there's some shit I'm gonna leave behind
For now, it's food for thought it'll feed your mind
But you can't get a piece of mind (naw homie)
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, Imma make a million
Bitch please, Imma make a million 'cause
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, Imma make a million
With ease, Imma make a million
Now, I can either try and be a hero
Or I can grab a one with six zeros
What would I do with a million dollars?
First off, I'd start payin' bills to my father
Then pay for college, get (3J) a camera
Grab a spot in LA, a crib in Atlanta
Cop a phantom just to ride in
Some celebrity friends to get high with
Couple four models that I find dime with
'Cause the music that I make is timeless
The pressures on don't choke, heimlich manuever
Got my songs off of your computer
You wonderin' is it buzzin' just a rumor
I'm Superman, y'all just Lex Luther
Imma make a mil, that's fo real no deal
Just the illest mo' fucka in the bill so chill
I dream, I imagine, I believe that it'll happen
Bitch please, Imma make a million

4,A Night In The Studio,2009,The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown (2009),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Ay yo Josh
Ay yo where the fuck you at man?

Our session was at 9 its fuckin' 11
I'm out here, blow smokin' L's
Waitin for yo ass

Oh no I definitely still got some weed for the lab
But still when you gonna be here?
Soon? Mother fucker how so...
Oh there you are right now
Ay yo what's good bro?
This is a DJ Haze exclusive

Just here chillin'
Yeah I'm tryin' to go to the studio or whatever
Yeah I got shit to drop mpther fucker
I always got shit to drop damn
Ight you'll meet me there?
All right)
I woke up scratched my nuts
Rolled a swisher on the shitter
Got blow then I light me up a cigarette
The coolest flow coolio a movie roll
Now I'm tryna head up to the lab
I headed to the studio open the door
Say wassup to everybody who was 'posed perform
I'm bout to record they know I'm smokin' of course
Blow some haze in the air pull out my notebook
Then I head up to the booth load the beat off my email
Phone on silent ignorin' calls from females
My man Josh sit down get the tempo
Put on my headphones
Ight, let's go
I let go intro the beats startin'
Say a couple words try not to be retarded
'Cause I'm a goofy dude doin' what I choose to do
Eatin' tracks up like some snacks call me scooby doo
Now the beat about to drop verse 1
It's like a whirlwind the soldier pull the first gun
Everything's blank it's just me and the mic
I don't read a lot so I try and see what I write
Visualize the melody, hypnotize everybody watchin
I hope they ain't blink they eyes
'Cause you don't wanna miss a fuckin' second
When I'm catchin wreck
I be in the booth goin' off try to catch my breath
Couple more bars couple seconds left
Killin' 'em softly takin' extra steps
They never guessed I be murderin' and blessin'
Ight the first done but before we start the second
We gotta do man shit
Doubles and ad libs
And Josh makin' sound like magic
He a old school genius with the pro tools
Tryna school me on everything that the pros do
I tell him that he needs to think it in the book
But for now we makin' guap just singin' on some hooks
So I don't worry 'bout the chorus
The track gotta hook on it
And my verses wit dat, they sound good on it
Now I do a second maybe do a third
If I'm in the mood to go crazy with my words
I take a lil' break got some haze to burn
The cast sittin' outside can wait they turn
We makin' classics in the session
Mom's askin me these questions
(When you comin' home you got school)
Naw, I'm suspended
After this track done burn the last blunt smokin' good
Payin' for my time with stolen goods
Say peace to whoever, outside its dark
I'm blowed and can't find where the fuck I parked
So I beep the car, oh there it is
Lets go ahead and hip hop in the whip
Light them cigarette and sit
Gotta ride homie ahead of us
(Sprunked) in the back
Tell my man wit the whip to bump on my track
Tryna ride out, and I'm high now"
5,Aliens Fighting Robots,2012,Macadelic (2012),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
Y'all is dead weight, less great, always gettin' second place
I tend to race ahead of pace, dippin' while I'm dressed in Bape
Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain't DiCaprio
This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall
Capicola sandwich's are tasty from Primanti's
I'm a 5'7 giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning
Girls want makeup, get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming
For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more
With money, 'cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for
Feelin' like a hundred wars are goin' on currently
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus
Actin' like you fuckin' with me, that's some shit I can't excuse
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe
You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works
I plan to do, somethin' that ain't tangible
Now I'm bout to hand it to
The homie Michael Rock, hear what he sayin' to you
(Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks)
Take a trip, took a molly out a bank a populari
And the word around the city is he sittin' in a Ferrari
I told my self I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry
That's my bad, I party till my cardies get foggy
Can't keep her hands off of me, got her locked, and lost the key
We smoke, make it hard to see, we go harder then Carter one
Excuse me baby pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?
Not saying its coming soon, but I want the real show
Give me the treatment that you getting all them heels for
The shit they payin' all the bills for
Man I missed it, that cake taste delicious
They can't wait for vacations, paid for by pictures
I'm feeling good, I'm pulling bills I'm real as hell
I don't front I roll blunts and papers
Don't fuck with fakers
Your girl is asking me if I'mma take her
I'm straight though
You see I'm booked up till April
That's mine, that's me, I take those
You try to see some peso's than shake though
You get exactly what you paid for, stop acting like you can't go
Swagging till the ankles
I feel you baby
Hopefully I look familiar, lately
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you'll never ever get it because
It seem like it'll only happen when I'm holding the drugs
You can never ever see it because
(Mac Miller)
Life a cliche, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land and then the bags come
We walking on this planet seeking action
Breaking girls hearts, sorry Miss Jackson
Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you'll never ever get it because
Seem like it'll only happen when I'm holding the drugs
You can never ever see it
And it won't stop till the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gonna Rock
This some shit you won't top
I said it won't stop till the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gonna Rock
This some shit you won't top
I'm so high what you think about that babe
On some other shit, tell 'em baby act crazy
Fifteen thousand, blow it on clothes
Six in the morning still sitting here throwed
I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to the house, and I wonder if she know"

Eyes half closed, heavy like they was attached to bricks
Around the world I use my atlas make a map of it
Globe trotter, hoe hopper, super star, ask direct ...

Pullin' up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar
Wanna be on top and tryna get there by tomar (tomorrow)
See, money, bitches love me, designer clothes foregin cars
But, I, ain't never gonna change different city everyday you hear these people scream my name
They think I'm underage, they don't know shit about the game
Till I'm drunk as fuck, on the couch, pouring out champagne
Living life like it's my job, and I don't ever take a day off
Shit ain't been the same since I seen my music take off
I be on some ""I don't give a fuck"" shit
Still with my homies I came up with, so celebrate the fast track ...

This the only way to do never made a plan B
Can't we, get it how we live
Tonight is the night to chill, tonight we do it big
Girls, comin' all dressed up and they takin' off their clothes

You need something new, I know your life is gettin' old
We ain't gettin' younger so tonight's the night to go
So, crazy, treat it like your last night
Even if you broke, spend tonight like you cash right
It's the fast life, don't worry baby we ain't here to slow it down

Testing my civility, I'm telling you

And some of them be grilling me but
I just blow my kush smoke up to the ceiling G
Yeah, and take a toke of the Swisher smoke

What is an emcee if he can't rap?
Just a monkey with a mic just waiting to get slapped
What is a DJ if he can't scratch?
The one rotten apple that's spoling the whole bag
What is a B-Boy if he can't break?
Might as well do the Dougie or even the Harlem Shake
And what is a graffiti artist if he don't tag?
No homophobia, but he's a fag
'Cause it's deeper than all that ...

One time for the world 'cause we do it for y'all
That logo light up in the sky when the studio call
Moving the crowd, get 'em loud without a gimmick
Spit with a golden ticket, I'm whipping it up in minutes
My feet up in this game
Rapping even made a divot
Don't worry about the critics
If it's happening now, forget it
For my heart is where I give it
Stay thinking about the future
When I'm rich, I'mma call my mom before I call the movers
These haters are just losers
Hate to see you winning
Gave my all from the beginning
I'm in it for extra innings
Here to change the world like a change clothes
Wouldn't mind a little bankroll, pesos
But I""m right here for way more
What is somebody if they can't love?
A hater... someone give 'em a hug
We here to change the world with this thing called rap

I bowl strikes you always leavin' a few pins
I do me you keeping up with them new trends
I got fam you worried about makin' new friends
I'm in my pj's you had to wear your suit in
Thinkin' without doing, where, how, why me
Relax myself kick it like Tai Chi
You could find me, only where I'm at
There ain't no other mes
They be checkin' on my stats
How Cat I find them up in a tree
Homie be spittin' bars they ain't fuckin' with me
I'm just turning up the heat to 100 degrees
Spittin' like I got a razor blade stuck in my teeth
We Spending all this money
Spending all this shine
Piffing all this kuddi
Spending all this time
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for ... better ... or for
All this money
Spending alll this shine
And it's all so funny
'Cause it's all just fine
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for ... better ... or for ... worse"
10,America,2012,Macadelic (2012),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
I'm, in a room filled with holographic images
Path is limitless, death, well that's ridiculous
I'm a live forever, cause a legend never die
See the world is simple, but complex in the design
I, spent some time just thinkin', where did that get me? high, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try and understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Itchin' halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world, the lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun
And I'm a shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run
Mac Miller, I'm the only one, but I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium
Got my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch spliff
Hand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America, motherfucker, welcome to America
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
Still, in a room filled with holographic images
Crushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it
Directly to my head, never sleep or use my bed
Iller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed
Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options
American born, impeccable form above and beyond, Medal of Honor
(Verse 3: Casey Veggies)
Yo chick live in Pittsburgh? bet I steal her
Shout out to my wigga Mac Miller
Comin' up in a world full of killers
I'll be shaded up at the villa
With a girl that know what the deal is
They don't know I come from the illest
City on a map, we don't know how to act
Release young rap, go getters in America
Bad chick get tossed around like the merry go
CV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's
We the future so every night is a new day
Sittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low
Young visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show
I can trigger the wave in my sleep
Name paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat
Wake up shower, get paid and repeat
Spit one flow and got made on the streets
Welcome to the land where you never stay for free
Swag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal, Veggies
(Verse 4: Joey Bada$$)
Bout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick
Rollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach 6
Rise to the top, the topics change the Glocks in the stock
Exchange that watch the price of life on the block
Drop insane, you can't stop this rain, Don't name drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains it's awkward strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Everybody love him and chicks offered top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters so up in the flow
No deal but flow so real keepin' in the scoops
Sun got shine, now he said he shady but he never dippin' though
Still facing L's you would think the niggas wins was low
What you think I'm in this for? Won't stop till the nigga who
Invented dope in the flow will behind bars droppin' prison soap
Begging for forgiveness, but it's business though
I'm record spittin' Guinness flows
Got it up in sources now he in the store"

Towards the over side of my leader
One day I'm a get it all cleaned up
Right now I'm a dirty my jeans up
This what I do, start the day
Picturing back all the pain
All that shit that sort of say
Had a vision, lost it's way
This planet different that we live it, yea, I bet it is
Product of the new world, you stuck in genesis
And I'm just tryna rep my city right like Bettis did
I got a crazy girl that's filled with all these fetishes
And she can get me high, when I'm feeling low
Fill my cup with purple, baby drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go
(X2:) Don't be afraid
I told her please don't take this back from me
This feeling come so naturally
Exactly what I wanna do, I'm acting so erratically
You get me high, owe me that, this is real but don't be scared
It's only fair, I warned you that love a drug that can kill you
Got your open heart, I'd have it never
Grown poor to last forever
Hopin' you'll remember what I tell you lookin' in your eyes
Don't be afraid of what can get you high
Just hold me tight and watch the seconds fly
I wonder where will I meet her
The perfect girl that I dream of
For now don't need no huge tits, I'm a cool with just a good B cup
Uh, you're now free to ball, build it up then keep it all
She don't need a car, if love demanded now we could roll
And we drive there, save everything that we not said
I'm telling you that you hard to trust
You say you're not, got a hard head
This forever, don't you ever think to let me go
And if I'm talkin' to the world I need to let 'em know
And she can get me high, when I'm feeling low
Fill my cup with purple, baby drink it slow
And I can take you anywhere you wanna go

I told her please don't take this back from me
This feeling come so naturally

14,Aquarium,2013,Watching Movies With the Sound Off (2013),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Yeah
Do you feel it?
Don't answer, that was a rhetorical question
Rhetorical (rhetorical)
Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process
And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's saying the place is safe for me
I told ""wait for me,"" the make believer normally disguise
Transforms before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wonders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walking I'm stealing jobs around Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these premadonnas
I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings
I'm living a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, can you sign off?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Can you wait girl, so I won't be
Hold you closely, so we don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'm just trying to make it all make sense
As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have and the curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meanings of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes
We all in search for substance, that gives you pain and numbness
Circumstances advancing the second chances, for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrow's trend
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days
Life, it works in such mysterious ways
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say
I'm living a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, can you sign off?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Can you wait girl, so I won't be
Hold you closely, so we don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Wherever my mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?"

Alarming all of these cardinals like I need a pope
Puffing that white smoke, get faded and play the maestro
I'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe
Sneaky bitch stole my Rolly last night yo
I might know some dyke hoes who can fight though
Walking on a tight rope, underneath a microscope
But close up, we all just molecules and isotopes
What psychic don't know the future?
To live life you kids might, just close your computer
The street lights might blind you though
Make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope
There's a bird in the sky
Look at him fly
Why...
A little TV money, dollars for sense of humour
Scholar for my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor
Some cold brews in the cooler
Coming through in the woodgrain PT cruiser, stuntin'
I'm pissed off like a blind person looking for a restroom
Probably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes,
Sorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude
And I was raised better, say God bless you

Now move to your place

While you sititn in some socks
Cops tryna get me lock
Catch me fucking with shenanigans
But ill just handle them and throw them in the ambulance
They want to know what my hands is in
Scare me straight

What's good fam, I love money, I will marry cake.
Get a rich bitch like Ashley and Mary Kate.
And I ain't talking about one of them
I'm getting both
I grab them and get a lo
And then take their money and their coats
I blow trees, so my mouth is always filled with smoke

Singing but you havent hit a note
Plus that shit you wrote isn't set to carry a crowd
I'm legendary anywhere that I'm out

While other shit will make you dance
So I bump what ever is in the system
Tryin' to make some plans
I just want to see what's good for the night time
IF nothings hype, Ima head up to crib and write rhymes
Age like white wine, nicer by the second,
That's why I never put punctuation on a sentence

If they say I wasn't for real, then you was told wrong

Logo never make a man, but I'm still blowin' thousands on it
No clue what I'm callin' my album
Fans be at my van screamin', callin' me Malcolm
Never knew the outcome be this much cash now
Bank account lookin' like a George Jung stash house
Young and actin' out, the topics that I rap about
Be varying from politics to bitches pullin' asses out
That's exactly how I do this as a rapper
I'm nuttin' in her mouth you tongue kissin' her after
Daughters' moms kinda want me neutered
But they also want the kid to cum right on their cooter
Have the music soundin' better then guitar tuners
Plus I'm doing shows daily call me John Stewart
So who you know that's iller than Mac Miller and company
It's like I planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin' tree
Now I got a hundred g's so none of y'all can fuck with me
Yeah I said it publicly so run and tell your mother, motherfucker
I said run and tell your mother, motherfucker
Hold up Jerm let me spit the second
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
Hey yo I breeze past haters in the E-class quickly
In deep, did a hundred songs and that's this week
Shit keeps goin' on and on
We just tryna go bananas like it's Donkey Kong
Yeah, on my grind, always need to work
So I be eatin' good, you be eatin' dirt
If you talkin' shit, you gonna see me smirk
While the DJ be scratchin' till the needles burst
A couple screws probably loose in my head
Holla at my girl, tell her bring that doobie to bed
I'm a regular guy within a regular life
Except I'm a Lamborghini if it's racin' a bike
Who knew that I can turn turn sound into somethin' so cool
Fresh kids, see me I'm bustin' the moves
Coming in soon to a theater near you
Creep in your kitchen start eating your food
Girls tryna fuck I don't be in the mood
No time for pussy when money in the room
Oh, I switch flows switch rhythm
Sick spittin', unlimited ammunition
This is Blue Slide Park"
22,Boom Bap Rap,2011,"I Love Life, Thank You (2011)",Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Hey
Big Jerm
Cool beat that we made here man
I play the keys you play the drums
We do a little bass on this one
Ah
Hey
All right All right All right All right
'92 till infinity and beyond
Your witnessing the gambles of infinity
Music in my soul on they go and getting rid of me
Peace and divinity in each and every inch of me
We living through this melody you singing in a different key
See I'm nice with these rhymes, I might be blind
Just see inside of minds, I gets unkind
I'm like a physic I don't give a fuck if you like this
We here to party, had a little music to turn up loud
92 till infinity just some shit that you ain't heard in awhile
I don't give a fuck if there ain't a party
We got a little music to turn up loud
We different got our life that we living
Standing out in the crowd
That boom bap rap
They ask me how I do it
I'm just cool like that
All right all right all right all right
That boom bap rap
When they ask you what your doing
Tell 'em your cooling
Keepin' it moving
Ain't nothing new I'm a do what I do
Pullin up in something that you haven't seen
Clean and accompained by one of the baddest queens
Peel the top back feeling superb as I pass the green
We just coolin vibing without the magazine
Breezing through 376 thinking about my past ventures
Came from running, duckin and jumping over fences
Used to play reckless trying to get the check
Stopped now it's visions with my camp from the triple deck yaught
I can't stop, won't stop I keep running
Unleash the beast, freak beats and keep coming
Nasty but we spit it so sincerly
Drip phlem from the pen so they can feel me
Boom bap ones with the hiphop
They say we different wonder how we do it but it's sealed in a ziplock
Killin' beats from 87 till the end of me
And Mac been involved since 92 until infinity
This that boom bap shit, return of mister boom bapstic
Mostdope making new classics
Screem beef dog, look lose that shit
You ain't built for contact better do glasses
Haters get mad my view zoom past em
You lose that bitch, you think local I do atlas
Vinny Radio do that shit
It's like bird flu how I move that sick - ness
Got my money looking healthy work to stretch it everyday we call it physical fit-ness
Made my name in the game from playing no games but giving these beats the bussi-ness
It's a guaranteed conviction every time I kill a track I'm letting you all with-ness
We deserve a reward for bring back that boom bap rap that you Miss-in"
23,Brand Name,2015,GO:OD AM (2015),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"We in between heaven and hell
Fuck your 9 to 5, I'd rather end up either dead or in jail
American ninja to these obstacles
No stoppin' me, we on the move
Your mouth runnin' like a prostitute's
Keep your head to yourself
I work harder than anybody you know
I'm done with tricks, don't need no money to blow
Deadly aim, self contained
Superstar, they yell the name
Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain
The P fitted on my head though
I'm too high, you can't read me with the cell phone
No goodbyes, no hellos
You don't want this life I live
You'd rather had the wife and kid
Shootin' dice with Jesus Christ, put 20 on the midnight
To everyone to sell me drugs
Don't mix it with that bullshit I hopin' not to join the twenty seven club
Just want the coke dealer house with the velvet rug
Fuck the world there's no one else but us
Everything we think we love
It ain't nothing but a brand name
To everyone but us
Ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name
Baby, this right here is hand made
I got brothers I don't need no friends
My shoes off I'm comfortable, I'm chillin' smokin' weed again
I'm from the berg not the burbs
Investigating my nation, homie we ain't concerned
We're from the 412 out to the 310
We're from the pavement in my basement to 'em yellow brick roads
See, I was on my Ps and Qs like L-M-N-O
But kickin' bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em to go home, I don't know
I was in the crib with my different shit
Simple livin', I'm a hypocrite
'Cause I'm filthy rich, I got business
Been had wifey's, have mistresses
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listening
The war ain't winnin', it just beginnin'
And I've been 'bout Sparta since Michigan
I got stats, they got opinions, I got facts
The bro left home, but he came back
This what raised me, made me rap
PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately
See, I'm laughin', they call me shady
I'm a white rapper, they always call me shady
Got no idea what I'm contemplatin', I guess...
It ain't nothing but a brand name
To everyone but us
It ain't nothing but a brand name, nothing but a brand name
Ask her what she wearing, say it's nothing but a brand name
Baby, this right here is hand made
Everyday we love, love
Good morning
Good morning
And everyone want-
Good morning

Yeah, okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is banging like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like
Dracula
It's the young miraculous, mister love-to-grab-his-nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with forty courses, bunch of horny whores and fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon, man
I bring this to you like lalalalala-live man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell them ""shhh"" this middle finger sign for silence
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keeping quiet
(Mac Miller:)
Yeah, riding through the city blowing smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol, they looking out for all the criminals

So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit
But now I walk around with money and my hand on my dick
I think I'm special, I'm drinking whiskey out the bottle till I black out
One million, two million, shit I'm losing track now
Coming to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound (Wow), turned that to a house (Wow)
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here?
(Spending all your time just getting high won't drive you crazy, crazy)
I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the 80's
Speeding down the freeway getting head in my Mercedes
Giving me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better
No pressure, dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola, have you ever been?
Shit I probably could've been the president

To the top now baby
Imma take my time
Through rain sleet snow
Imma keep getting dough
You can find me on my ground
So put ur muthafuckin hands in the sky
And if ur sittin' down please stand
'Cause I'm on the rise and I reside
On this castle made of sand
Let me getta hand clap
Imma make an entrance
Giving y'all the lecture
Then I'm taking questions
My soul is sour making sentence make a weapon
Swimming in the deep end
You bitches taking lessons
Then I hear you hating on the boy
Well I ain't affended
'Cause I'm the captain of the team and you play the benches
From breaking it down to rolling it up
Put an a d in the blunt
And I'm smoking it up
But ta kos but I stay with a few
But they replace like the lace in my shoe
So tell me what to do"

(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
Figure all this out, I ain't gona take a charity
Marry me, wish everyone could shake and play the tambourine
Perfect, I know I love you I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss, I know that we would stay together, we ain't?
Infatuation, when every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin' towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, vove activeness
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for, I hope you found what you lookin' for
You away take the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
Ima be waitin' for that (x2)
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
Misery, you represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me, I'll come out of nowhere, your epiphany
Disconnect, from everybody who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet, is where my mind is so I light another cigarette
To calm me down, so calm me down
Everybody who can see me now is not around, choppa down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between, purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream, that's so cliche but I can't tell you what it means to me
You away take the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm paying you back
Ima be waitin' for that (x2)"

Look, comin' with the flows of a veteran, Mac class president
All black letterman, recognize a gentleman
Know anything but formal, take you out the normal
Its time travel here step into my portal
Never seem to be another ordinary college fellow
Still keep a buncha action figure, Donatello's
I used to wet my pants leave the carpet yellow
Now I'm playin' games with hoes turn they hearts to jello
""L"" rolled from my wrist to my elbow
Hella smoke got my eyes red like Elmo
Music that I make got me buzzin like a cellphone
Stickin to my word now I'm velcro, Hell No!
I ain't gone stop one minute better than I ever been
Before it was just a scrimmage, No the boy playin' for the cup
It's a championship, see the word play dance from his lips
All my ladies put ya hands on ya hips, here some candy to lick
Come and holla if ya man is a bitch
Every party that I roll to they demand me to spit
Treat me like I'm Peyton Manning in this
Playa I don't got no time for the slow grind here in 09'
Blow minds with these dope rhymes, call them coke lines
Snort it get the ??? I'm takin' you out of orbit
Plus we poppin' champagne see the corck twist
Purple piff got me higher than a forklift
Hungry, feed it like my mother got four tits
I'm livin' in this music you a tourist
Rocky and Bulwinkle you just Boris
Boy spit still way sharper than a swordfish
Yo whole style just dead like a morgue is
Imma senior but I stay fresh man
Class president never would've guess man
Bitches on me that I ain't neva met man
The only thing that's on yo dick is ya left hand
Wolverine nails signin on the X man

Fresh off a steroid swisher
Pistol at the people that's a paranoid nigga
One of a kind though
Ain't nobody close to me
Your answers straight over D
I'll bag you like groceries
It's whatever though
Whatever cross my mind
Haters got no watch
I ain't got the time
Vinny got more flow than a box of wine
Rare as a copper dime
I got an awkward mind
But it's beautiful, like Russel Crowe
Fire at the fingertips can't extinguish it
Shorty gave me tight head without shrinkin' it
Coolest kid out, on my Chuck Inglish shit
Mac and Vinny, always get the people loose
Fall back, strike back
Just like evil do
The birds prey on us like eagles do
It's like claymation the way they bend and move.

And you talking but it's so cheap
And I'm popular for a reason
I got a pool but it's sharks swimmin' in the deep end
Don't get much sleep, two minutes to get a dream in
Is all you need
It's crazy
The colony was lost at sea getting wavy
The rawest rapper
Baby forehead autographer
On top of Saturn
I'm sending shots from a rocket blaster
Believe me this is where geniuses live
It's Most Dope
We holier than all of Jesus' kids
But we speaking in heathens
And all of these Even Stevens
Who don't need a reason
Just want a bitch they can feed with semen
No need for sleeping
Cheeba gon' keep me dreaming
I'm faded
Been in Cali a lil too long it got me jaded
Hit Japan and I'm instagram camera shy samurais
Fucking up a Jerm beat
Teach you how to vandalize
The bandana Santana tied
The sound amplified screams on Kennywood's Steel Phantom ride
My pockets fat, I'm still looking for some pants my size
They over-analyze everything I fantasize
We could have a conversation, we could pantomime
Girl you could come a little closer put your hand in mine
This life a prison, it's time to set you free
Watching movies in silence describing what I see

My true shorty though, I've had all sorts of hoes,
Take my time when I'm with her, drink my 40s slow
And give us a second, you'll find us on the bed
Wild sex, with her legs behind her head.
Turn her over on her stomach, get her from the back
She always leave a scratch, but I like that
She the type that, you wanna wife that
And she like me, cause all I do is pipe that
Buzzin' like a bumble bee, that's chillin' by the hive
Love her with no limits, cause my ceiling in the sky
Feelin' up ya thighs, tongue ticklein ya twine
When I get it from behind, ya say its twistin up your spine
Baby, I'm one of a kind, that finds that spot that have ya climax

I'm a motherfucking fool, cut the check
I'm a working motherfucker need a desk shit

I'm a mess, they be saying they up next, that's a stretch
Hold your breath let me bow to the crowd, shit I'm blessed
Well I must be, bitches want to fuck me, bump uglies on front street
The cards on the table, gin rummy
Have a blast, have a ball, have a motherfucking great time
Beast, I'm a dog, got a squad full of K-9s

I'mma get it till there ain't shit left to get
No stress, running suicides, don't even break a sweat

You getting fucked by your contract what the fine print says
Told you once, I told you twice, I get the Lamb it's over rice
I whip the Lamb it's overpriced, the life is good the hoes are dikes
The type of shit don't happen overnight (God damn)
I'm a motherfucking fool
This shit on 100 degrees, hard as fuck ain't in a rush
I let the money come to me, I'm a business man
I'm way too young to be this rich
I don't know what to do with all this shit
I'm out of control, Lord can you save my soul?
How convenient, you ain't worried about shit right now
How convenient, you're just tryna keep it lit right now
How convenient, screaming money over bitches right now
How convenient, bet you're feeling like the shit right now
(Chief Keef:)
How convenient, undefeated
Walked up in Neimans spent the sac then I'm leaving
Smoking on reefer, OG reeking
Got the cops pull me over they gon' want to take the Bimmer
But I'mma do the dash, beat it like Tina
And I got my nina boy, you better be subpoenaed
Walked in the spot, ice on, lights on, blingin'
Someone start a fire 'cause it's fucking freezing
I'm high off life give me the blunt I'm a roll it
I got hot rocks I'ma let you hold it
I was posted with the hammer y'all was telling police
Now I wrestle with racks, bitch I'm Mick Foley
Shit made me go woo like Rick Florer
I mean Ric Flair bitch boy I've been player
You a bench warmer boy I've been playing
Walked up the stairs look at my shoes like them cleaner
But I should've worn the other ones cause them better

35,Desperado,2012,Macadelic (2012),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Uh, Chya, Uh, Uh
Dedicated too, this dedicated too
F-ck it
Uh, I got a pocket full of posies
Some devil with a pitchfork keep talkin' like he know me
I'm psychopathic, low key, my hyperactive dome piece
Get no sleep, ill as fuck, the hospitals seem so weak
I stood before an Angel as he told me 'bout the glory
Put me in a room of people, how the f-ck could I be lonely
I only get money, these lables tryna clone me
Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete.
So, I try to keep em' in my head
It's sad to see when everything that you believe is dead
Word to Heavy D, and rest in peace to all that come and pass
Life is good sometimes, but it just doesn't last
A bunch of tracks, you see this mic is like my punchin' bag
Rock 'n' Roll, drugs and cash, you softer than a bubble bath
Sucka ass mothafucka, muthafucka's venom and
Doper than the shit that put Chris Tucker in Dead Presidents
Desert rhymes, homie, ridin' beats, I'm on a camel
I'm way too hot to handle, life a beach, I brought my sandals
Haha, you want a war ? I got a lot of ammo
You ain't a soldier cause you rockin' cammo
Young Rambo, hundred million fans though
And I do it big, you a Ipod Nano
Fire on wax, look like I rock candles
Yeah you got a show, but you ain't on my channel
That's HBO b!tch, you gotta pay for that
Hahaha, your channels free
I'm gunna f-ckin' kill you
Um, Imax'n shit motherf-cker
Yeah, suck my d!ck
Hey, ayo, I'm bout to start gambilin' with Ambien
I'm dutch smokin', that's a strike
But f-ck bowlin', I could tear a pin of Maryland
See, I'm American, apparently it's damagin'
To be in front of cameras in your underwear with Marilyn
Monroe, look at dumb hoes who want to much dough
And come close to have you straight trippin' when you jump rope
Don't rock the love boat, this business f-ckin' cut throat
And it's gunna crack is you just paint the wall with one coat
Rooms filled with blunt smoke, peep me through the fog
These rappers who be hatin' probably need to get a job
See, me I'm with my squad, gettin' money, livin' comfortable
I know a couple hoes who model, but they ugly though
F-ck a toast, y'all is f-ckin' broke, cut ya throat
Judgin' me is nothin' dope, boy you lyin' under oath
God made the world, why did man make the scriptures?
And if he created Lennon, why'd he go and make a Hitler?
I could take a photo, but I'd rather paint a picture
Of the one Lawrence Fishburne, we'll shoot up all you hipsters
I'm from Pittsburgh, that's black and gold
If my skin gets filled up, I'mma tat my soul
Runnin' out of paper, writin' on my hand
Hundred thousand haters writin' bout my jams
Want a number one independent album? I'm your man
I'mma hit Preme and leave you all right where you stand"

She keep on gettin' played like it's recess, break her heart's a reflex
She want to hit the beach, and show her titties down in Key West
Someone leave her crying all the time and now she finally out of Kleenex
Sick of dudes not givin' her the respect
Cause really she a genius, a CEO
Tryin' to be on top alone, she don't keep them close
She been waitin' for the opportunity to be a boss
Tough bitch, probably would've thought she played lacrosse
Sick of bein' soft with her heart broken all the time
Want some money too, fuckin' dudes
And falling all in love with who, was nothin' new
Only coming through to bust a nut or two
She just need her family like the Huxtables
And now she on the road, left them home to takeover
Get rich and have her crib made over
But she gonna do it partyin', with her cup full
Ain't gonna trust you, but she gonna fuck you
She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
And she's been high and she's been low
But now she finally on her own
And they've been looking
So they been finding
'Cause she ain't runnin'
And she ain't hiding
Until she finds her place back home
And then she's finally all alone
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
She gonna be rich, as fuck
In high school they were callin' her a slut
But now she coming up, Louis Vuitton and Juicy on her butt
See the bitches that be hatin' like ""What's up?""
'Cause they ain't doing nothing and she out here stuntin'
Middle finger to them hoes, all them bitches had it comin'
Yeah, on top of the world, she lookin' down
Invite you to the crib, let you look around
Just a fuckin' tease, tryna get your cheese
Invite you out to dinner, 'cause she want to eat for free
She could pay it if she wanted to, she won't though
Go home, she got more dough
She wants diamonds, she wants gold
But she's scared to let you get too close
And she's been high and she's been low
But now she finally on her own

So they been finding

Hey, it seems like every day
I gotta filled up phone
Ladies tryna text me
Sayin' that they home for the Summer
And they heard that I'm livin' on my own
So they wanna come to the crib
Maybe cook me some supper
But I'm busy, so I'm ignorin her

So these funny little girls wanna take a trip
But no, only the M.O.S.T. dope with me
Other fools homo, Roy and Siegfried
No disrespect though,
I gotta get that cigarette flow
For the green pesto, presto
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns, slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm a sleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
Me I'm highly underestimated
So educated that gettin' paid quick
If you ever hated anticipate that I'm famous
Got a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with
Celebrate that we seein' another day, life good
Never wanna end this
Me and Mary Jane got a really nice friendship
Yeah they give me money
But I gotta go and spend it
Man, I been a bad little jew
But I gotta pay the bills now
So I gotta chill out
I ain't walkin' round like I'm splurging wit a mil now
Feel like the kid workin at the mill now
Used to just chill and smoke joints up at Bills house
Now I gotta schedule, things I gotta do
Doin' interviews, see it up on youtube
I say it feels just like a dream
'Bout to wake up from a nap
How fucked up was that like
I'd like to make myself believe

Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon for now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoon,
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it cause you walkin' out in public, and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride. Ride through the city in a cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere get my nuts kissed that's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?

And motherfuckers think they know me but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money made benevolence irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my henny break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party'll never end
This life is what I recommend
And if you got a hoe to pull me then she better be a 10
I ain't picky but these girls be actin' tricky when the situations sticky and the liquor got'em silly
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?
We gon take over the world while these haters gettin' mad

I'm on my way over, I'm just running kind of late
And you know I've been through all the highs
I've seen all the lows
Lost track of time, I'm coming home
You know my mind, the place it goes
When it goes, when it goes
It's only a game
Don't be afraid
These doors will close
And people change
One day you'll go
Right now you're here
No please just hear
Don't disappear"

Hey, I got a...
Cup of Henny,
Joint of good,
Not gettin' any sleep, even though I should.
Catch a early flight,
Hit another city,
For a concert full the fans who be fucking with me.
Countin' hundreds, fifties
Groupy hoes,
That all love to show me how they drop they booty low.
Two in ones,
That's a Manaja twa,
Watch they bras come off, have me saying LA-DE-DA.
Rock and Roll,
Living life,
Gettin' head,
Get it twice.
It feels like I've been drunk for the 11th night.
Don't know how I'm gonna wake in time to catch this flight.
All these bitches in the front row try to dress alike.
They do a lot of barking, but they never bite.
They lookin' at me like I'm gonna have some sex tonight.
And yes I might if it's all right.
'Cause I got what you need if you lookin' for a trip,
Escape the world a lil bit, maybe go and get a grip,
This all can be a drug, just please don't take too much,
You can have it free of charge, though I do it for the love (x2)"

Levels reaching several
Rose pedals deliver
Make you feel special
They thought the money should a changed it
Slide still blue
Why the world keep trying to paint it
When life around you changes
Try to keep your sameness
Try to keep your brain maintain through the lameness
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park
The only place I call home
I hope it's never all gone
Don't think its ever all gone
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park
The only place I call home
I hope it's never gone
Forever long"

I'm so close but they don't know, got some freaky hoes and weed to blow, rock the cleanest clothes.My life different from every single kid you know, places I go out on my own, hoes stay blowin' up my phone but I wanna be left alone.
Doin' shows every 4 or 5 cities in a row hit me with some dough 'cause they know I'm bout to blow.
You can always say no if you wanna lay low but you look so good you need to get up on that floor.
Don't you feel good?
Don't you feel great? I feel so fly and I hope you can relate.
Got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee.
It's the same old dude but a brand new me. I been up and I've been down, thought I was the coolest motherfucker around.
But I'm just another face in the crowd, I said I'm just another face in the crowd.
They tell me its impossible to do it I'd be stupid if I tried but I'm using a maneuver I'm just movin them aside.
I'm just tryna make some music for the ride listen to it when you drive destination you arrive.
Russell
Crow it's a beautiful mind, imagine what ill do with some time usually find me chillin' up in Jupiter
I'm so happy you mad some khakis of some sags, moms said you can see my ass and she laughed blindfolden in a turn pike hopin I don't crash. stashin the weed under the passenger seat hope these 16 wheelers don't crash into me.
People takin' pictures when I pass in the street.
Zoom by all fast in my seat belt now you know how we felt.Don't you feel good?
Don't you feel great? I feel so fly and I hope you can relate.

43,Family First,2011,"I Love Life, Thank You (2011)",Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
Dealing with everybody's opinion, tryna to do me
Only down one, I'm in the final shooting threes
Like I don't give a fuck, music we fuck and switch the position up
We love the things that keep on bringin' out the kids in us
Been workin' all my life to do some different stuff
And people have the nerve to say I'm young and haven't lived enough
I'm on the road, my girl so sad, I'm gone
It's hard when I can't even find the time to call my mom
When she thinks I'm goin' Hollywood, I guess she probably should
It seems like people see the bad and don't acknowledge good
I feel the shade but I can see the sun, I'm cool
I got the time to feel the need to run, a fool
Is what I've become, young and I'm dumb
Been spendin' cake to get some bump in the trunk, drums with a pump
Like some Reeboks, see me from the treetops
They worry but they need not, heatin' like a teapot
Now I think I'm cool 'cause I got a pair of shoes
And more dough, a jacket with a Polo logo
My cup always filled with Henny, so no Four Loko
They should know, so I could go slow
You see that I'm smooth now
Used to ignore me, they study what I do now
With some help from Kweli, and it's Like on the Beat
It's cool to say that my cypher complete
(Verse 2: Talib Kweli)
Word, I'm so sick with the verbs I use, the words that heal us
They love how I kill it on stage, man, Murder theaters
No wonder they call it a bunk, I sleep in a coffin
Dead tired, exhausted from how often I be touring
So gangsta, like the occupation of Made Men
Creatin' chaos, my operation is Mayhem
The movie never stopped, the frame change over
We added Mac to the wolfpack, hangover
That Hen is not a friend, I'm on that Lagavulin
Whatever substance, I abuse it like a Grown man
You're not a kid no more, don't want to hold your hand
And Four Loko make you shoulder-lean like a Dro fan
Go ham, like Abraham readin' all the signs
Oh yeah, and don't forget to call your moms
Same thing I told Bow Wow last year
Take care of the fam, 'cause it's all we really have here"
44,Fight The Feeling,2012,Macadelic (2012),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
So watch 'em do the macarena somewhere out in Pasadena
Love the drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Living, this time around I'm not kidding
I had an intuition about these women in suspicion
Got me looking at you different how a man in my position can't start slipping down these slopes
'Cause it's all just
As a kid I didn't learn that but
When you were young and you were just tryna live your life and have some fun
In the world when you have yet to see how evil its become
Its hard to have a dream when you're deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
Sometimes I be feeling like a needle to these young kids
You had the world you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is

So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smoking through the night
Wake up do some Tai Chi
Homie can't you see I'm chilling, please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah my jacket Y3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Balling like I'm Jordan but I'm fresh as Mars blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on an idea we never can agree
They tell you what you know but its better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be
Still I tell em
Fuck what you know, I'm feeling comfortable
Just continue living life 'cause enough of 'em don't
You spend your days counting every single penny, mane
Start now 'cause we coming for you anyways

Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make up
Wrap this much make up off my bitch soon as she yawning
Take up, hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it, even if your ears was pierced with
Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly falling
We all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling?
Oh, you left your phone behind,
Identity, crisis breaks mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and devil said you owe 10%
Sold your soul
I know sold your soul and get?
My focus is ? that float in the open
Oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme
Or choking or soaking up game
I'm hoping you picked the second one
The emotion of jealousy that your holding
You're telling me that your golden but really cubic zirconian
Let me see
I break you down like a pound of fire whenever your tactics are mighty clever
But even if you're Mayweather you

You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no"

Well my crew too live but I ain't Uncle Luke
And I ain't no hipster, girl I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Looking out my monocle
I'm dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cockroach, I'm heroin cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fucking shiny word to Mop and Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion ain't nobody here gonna find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my socks stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day these losers always goin' with what's trendy
My pen game is something these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion everybody is second string
No need to testify (testify) for the best is I (best is I)
And anybody in my way goin' to be left to die

Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on looking back

Hundred different shoes to fill no need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it's just my second year
Fool you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage
Sick bars I've been a boss so stick around and watch it
Did the round, no college campus chilling writing on top of planet Earth
Fuck whose first, It's just bout who the hardest
On my own too, fuck whose saying different
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney Phillin'
I'm the starter you the fill in
You a martyr I'm just killing
Getting harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don't call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in

Somethin' to feed off, we searchin' for it like groups of pigeons
Kinda futuristic, yeah it's cool, we different

Yeah, so tell me if you can, are you numb enough? can you listen in?
I will lose it to show 'em I'll get rich again
But matter fact, fuck that, 'cause I don't give a damn

All my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen
Hyper than Williams' middle son,
Since I was a little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Coming up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed
Contagious, speaking while sedated
God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothing left in my will 'cept
Throw it all in the casket, it's mine still
I need some backpack cast raps
Took a break just to kill the game half-ass
Set some rat traps, went to take a cat nap, woke up
Threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic
Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke
Slap her but she like it, tell me, ""Master, feed my pipe""

Suck my dick before I slap you with it

Ozo on these doppelgänger Jojos

No joke, most dope, you just bold smoke
How much coke you got to sell to make a boat float?
Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me ""No more.""
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say ""What's up?"" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche

First class flight, 'bout to land on a new bitch
She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came with
MCM bag and nigga, bet some weed in it
200 dollars worth of Backwoods, we all living
Brought the gangsters back to bucket hat, how real is that?
I'm getting money, rub my tummy, that's my baller sack
Put a million in a safe in case I get a case
Faggot-ass judge hating on me cause my money straight
Dropped 10 racks in all 50 states

Goin' down in history for rippin beats
Smooth game sweeter than a krispie kreme

Turn it up and follow all my journey as I live my dream
All natural whole foods that lay you back
Have you straight chillin' in a dope mood
And some shit is happy like a show tune

See out the window in my room that I've hidden aside
I'm just a kid who stays speaking and starts talking his mind
Like a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride
Put my heart up on the page and the song gonna cry
This larger behind the way you staring caught on the lime boy
Ain't a shock that I'm a topic of discussion
Motha fuckas want my spot so they probly wish I wasn't
They give a lil love like everyone does
In reality they still not off that competitive drug
And I don't blame em
'Cause those who above me I'm gunning for ya
Try and make my way to the top startin' from the floor
And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war

It's only been a year I can stick around a hundred more
Said I could stick around a hundred more

Young and so much time to go

And I ain't just a local guy
When you feeling stressed out have an L
Blow money keep my lady decked in Chanelle
Live fast when I die better wish me well

Just an everyday story that I'm here to tell
So please, stick around for the Epilogue
For anyone who ever blog probably heard my name
Hip Hop's underdog he wanna win the game
I'm sick of hearing hell music change never be the same
And these dudes who think they everything can never pick a lane
Call yourself a vet but haven't won a single game
And every girl got my name inprinted in her brain
Boy I'm a beast match this style in bars
Find me smoking weed where the wild things are
Yessir
So I mean, I had to take this time
Real quickly, to just go in
I don't know man I feel like you should never stop going in on your shit

She shine like she ain't know it raining
The game is the same as it was with the lame kids
You wanna hang with her every single day is funny
Your friends say you're whipped
Every late night you gotta go and dip
To pick her up and I've been sick of sluts

Explore the core of California, hoes got more to snort up

That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock

It's driving me crazy the fact that you pay to make me into something I love
You come to the club searching for drugs, drunk

You're wasting away doing nothing, you're fronting
Why ain't you chasing your dreams?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willin' to learn
The money we earn is something to burn
Why won't they give me a turn-out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked

Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spitting these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back
Forfeiting the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like he worked in the morgue absorbing the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today
Life is so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death, till there's nobody left
You're holding your breath cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinking I'm gettin' ballistic
Be specific, to those in control, we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers
Except I'm cool invader and blowing up rooms full of strangers
A news anchor, the youth can-relate-er, it's nature
If you're a hater, I'll deal with you later, no thank you
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on homie we major
I waste away in this room spitting out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back"

Ha. Yah
Uh
A million mothafuckin' fans on that ass, biotch!
Feels amazin'!
Ladies and gentlemen, I've always been the same kid, but now I'm famous
And I ain't even have to change shit
(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
Hey yo, they keep on sayin' this dude back, this dude back
But I ain't sound like this dude, bitch I'm Mac
Now these girls all tryna suck my dick, I rap
I may let her if I'm sippin' that yak
Yeah, too fly, submarine in the sky
Can't go out in public I better get a disguise
It's better to be yourself, don't ever just slip a lie
While I'm drivin' with the top down, listenin' to plies
Chicken wings and fries, I'm in love with all the simple things
Little things, soldiers be around always bickering
I got some money, threw some diamonds on a pinky ring
That's why your favorite girl probably on my ding a ling
Teeth blunts with peanut, standin' on a tree stump
Rappers need to keep up, my bitches love the B cup
She fucks, but she ain't no slut and she know that
She freeze up, livin' in the moment get a Kodak
Hold that, wait for it to flash, get the picture
I ain't doing much, just out on this adventure
Bus around the country, but I'm travelin' the world
With all these rappers that be hating like I'm battlin' with girls
Hey yo this where the hook be
But I ain't got no hook you pussy
I said this where the hook be
But bitch I ain't got a fucking hook you pussy
Yeah bitch, that could be a hook
You know what I'mma rap
If it's ok with y'all
And you can tell me if it was nice
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
Hey yo I kinda want a fur coat, kinda want a grill
She met me at the party, now she kinda want to chill
I ain't on no pills, just a little weed, molly, and lean
Yeah I did a couple drugs, now they callin' me Sheen
This was all a dream just a week ago, now I got a heap of dough
I keep a ho, that always got some weed to roll
All these rappers wack but I don't ever see 'em close
The illest mothafucka in it we don't need to vote
'Cause I don't give a fuck what y'all think
And I don't give a fuck what that dude on that blog think
Yeah I seen hay, been in an accord in 3 states
Had to deal with cheapskates, who always want a free play
You hold the weight of the world, I bet your knees break
Put my dick in a bitch hand, keepsake
You can't keep that, fuck off my case
You can keep some residue if I bust on your face
I'm just playin', mistakin' this asian
Always been amazin', since days I've been hangin'
In ancient places, now the kid famous
And he ain't even have to change shit, biatch!
A million mothafuckin' fans
Just want to take a second to thank y'all, you feel me?
Thanks for fuckin' with the kid from day one
You know what I'm saying, Blue Slide Park November 8th

For the good times or bad, I'll be there
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there
(Mac Miller)
See I was 6 years old with a dream, when my mums told me I can do anything
Said she'd be there forever, no matter what's the weather
She'd always have my back even when we weren't together
And I took her for granted, thought I had a plan
This a different generation, I don't think you'd understand
In the quest to be a man, you start to learn you need your family
It wasn't for them, I'd be way closer to insanity
It ain't about the vanity, think bout what's important
The reason I was 6 years old rocking some Jordans
The reason I had food, my own damn room
A TV and a living room to watch my cartoons
I just hope she know I love her, the World's best mother
Yeah ain't fair, so I'ma take care of her and her gray hair
When I get rich, I'll have her living how she should be
No stress, no worries, you can call me 'cause it's...
(Phonte)
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there
Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there
(Mac Miller - Verse 2)
Hey, hey, hey
Dear mama, please don't start to cry
You the reason I'm alive how these years have gone by
You were there when I was on my first bike riding in the street
That delivery truck almost ran right over me
You were at my games when I was sitting on the bench
When I skipped school, you lied saying I was home sick
Had my back before I had my own
I know I'm always welcome when I'm back at home
I just wanna bring you out on stage to get a standing ovation
All the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation
If you have your moms, you better treat her right
Call her up, say ""wassup"" before you sleep tonight
Tell her you love her and thank her for what she did
You may be grown now but remember being a kid when she fed you, shit
You were her baby, so find out what she doing lately, uh
I wanna tell you momma...

Sunshine or rain, I'll be there
For the good times or bad, I'll be there

59,I'm Not Real,2013,Watching Movies With the Sound Off (2013),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Passport, filling it up with stamps
Set a camp up on my land, swam the rivers of Japan
She keep on asking for a rack so I ran
Looking back, like you can't see who I am
Think my bitch don't know me no more
Cause every time she's sad I can't console her no more
If money buy you love, then love's not enough
So tell my why you on your knees crying to the floor
If you had the chance, would you take the time you need to make it right?
The clouds are gray but would you pay the price to paint them white?
Might have a baby on the way, 'cause I been going in raw
It feels better, that real pleasure
I'm not real, I think I never was
I get a rush every time she let me get a touch
I need to feel that (love)
I need to feel that (pain)
My garden hasn't been growing so can you bring that (rain)
I keep my head up (high)
A little fed up (lies)
They always tell me where my mind is on this LP
I don't exist
Hieroglyphics
Pyrotechnics
Metaphysics
Telekinetics put 50k on my credit card
Looking for answers, I'm searching but I ain't getting far
Let's get it on, I'm real like Tenenbaums in Lebanon
Decepticons, hit it till my head is gone
Point me to the road, and I'ma run it
Bloodhound with my nose to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes
Getting duckets till I die
While my foes busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toast it in public
Head in the clouds, my toes in the struggle
Like who didn't test yet? Test this
Few new rules in effect, bitch
See this a rather spooky action movie
Roll it up and pass it to me
Hashing booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting bougie
See a creature, ass beauty
Need a feature, rather shoot me
Truly bitches must have them bad jeans in bag of Coogi
Had to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming
Past the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you in fact assuming
Back to doing cash pursuing
Posted up like Patrick Ewing
Rapper fuser, sad if you would battle for a stack or two
These eloquent, irrelevant sentences show my penmanship
Indefinite boundaries, show you the end of it
Don't forget you infested in nasty crevices
Allowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly
He and I are not the same
Doctor, doctor, please prescribe me something for the pain
Money in machines, those will make you change
If I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain
But I can't complain
Point me to the road, and I'ma run it
Bloodhound with my nose to the money
Ain't fucking with these hoes
Getting duckets till I die
While my foes busy running, fuck it
Marijuana smoke in my stomach, toast it in public
Head in the clouds, my toes in the struggle
Like who didn't test yet? Test this
Few new rules in effect, bitch"

Anything money could buy, they was spending millions
I was tryna get to pimping, I was tryna blow up talking demolition
That boy got the devil in him, swear he need an exorcism
I'm all by myself, got no competition
Keep it real in a world that's filled with politicians

Smooth like I'm in love with her,
Tingles up my spine every time that I'm touchin her,

So for dinner she cooks food with 4 different types
Of cheese, in the sheets we have dessert until it hurts,
Feeling on her curves, I pet up on that pussy till it
Purrs, touch me touch me, I'm sure it's her that loves
Me, 'cause I could make the virgin mary fuck me.

Girls wanted me when I was chubby with some braces,
I bet they like me now 'cause I got money and I'm famous,
The taste is delicious her lips give me kisses,
Throw her in the kitchen and she making me some dishes,
Her dinner ain't right, ill admit its smellin awful,

Overdose with the holy ghost but hold the phones
I hold my own, was local grown
Been killing that shit since row the boat
Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest
One more drank, I'mma be an alcoholic
I don't wanna think like better unconscious
Need fresh air that thing so toxic
I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war
Told my mama you ain't need no drama
You ain't gotta cry no more
It'll be alright
My mind on the run I won't sleep tonight it's like
When it all goes up in flames who gon hold me down
And I'm the chosen one
Looking all around what has the world become
The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground
I've been getting paid
About four, five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain
This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'mma drown
You've never been better than me
From this prison I'm setting them free
Open eyes, I'mma let you see
This world is like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm running to the edge

Jump, jump, to see if I can fly
I wonder if I jump
Do you think that I can fly
It's the life of an entertainer
I need that check go on get the waiter
Fuck a troll, this destruction mode
And these explosions don't need detonators
I met my maker in an elevator, he was headed to the top floor
We're quite similar, we just did our work and we were in it for a lot more
We were trying to change the world but we got bored
When I rip this show, got an encore
Back when we were still in school we didn't listen to the list of rules
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles
I told my homies the top so lonely but
We're not gonna die not now
You'll make it here, live free tonight till the day appear
Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile
How do we get rich, if she acting crazy I don't need that bitch
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now
Go on and on, know I had this shit all along
Take a breath, feel this moment hold it just so you can
Look where we at, look where we came from
When will we wake up, lost in translation
You've never been better than me
From this prison I'm setting them free
Open eyes, I'mma let you see
This world is like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm running to the edge
And when I get there best believe that I'mma jump
Jump, jump, to see if I can fly
I wonder if I jump
Do you think that I can fly"
68,Just A Kid,2011,"I Love Life, Thank You (2011)",Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
I be goofy, kind of funny, actin' stupid, but they love me
We don't do it for the money, just some food up in my tummy
Feelin' cool, livin' great, in the mood, tryna' to sway
Ice cubes in my drink, never doin' what they say
They some losers full of hate, a nuisance gettin' cake
What I'm doin' everyday, probably ruin all your games
I got some brand new clothes fresh right out the package
The moon lookin' like I can reach right up and grab it
So close to the sky I'm high
Was a youngin' who would hope to be fly oh my
God, now I'm everywhere with my squad
When I spit a rhyme they applaud
And I say, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
You heard everybody's music, but wait till you hear mine
They either hate or they on your side
Fuck it we ridin', fuck it we ridin'
Playin' games to ease your mind
Damn I'm high, damn I'm high
And I know that they never understand
'Cause I'm just a kid, but they tell me I'm the man
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
If you know me, you are hatin', listen homie, I've been waitin'
For a golden opportunity to know that I'ma make it
Where I'm goin' I could take it, went from flowin' in the basement
To shows in all stages on the road to different places
Got they thumbs in the air, smile on they faces
Fans with grey hair and fans rockin' braces
Fans who be buyin' me drinks to get me wasted
Groupie hoes, thirsty as hell and wanna taste it
See this life even shocks me
I got some people on my nuts call em' jockey
And I ain't even gettin' cocky
But if you hatin' I'ma tell you this, watch me!
Bout to do somethin' amazin' bro
World changin' my brain got a gang of flows
And this for those who always came to shows
And who were still by my side with no bank to blow"
69,Just My Imagination,2009,The High Life (2009),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Wake up in my king size bed
Girls all around me
Eyes all red
The true life of a player kid
Its nice to wake up to a naked bitch
Got the finest clothes, diamond toes
Goin' to sleep on a pile of dough
Liquers, phantoms, yards, mansions
Piff in the cannons
House in the hamptons
(Livin' it up)
Big parties every night
This is the life of the paradise
My main man twist done told'em right
I make'em celebrities over night
Grammys, oscars, starin' in movies
Gotta pool house, 4 cars, and jacuzzis
On my way up, gettin' my cake up
Wake up
It was just my imagination,
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away
I got groupies, who got groupies
An I buy a new car every two weeks
My chain got diamonds in it
And my whip got a diamond finish
Got the mtv j-j-jam of the week
Sign autographs when I stand in the street
Plus I been all over B.E.T.
Columbia records, and D.T.P.
Both want me to sign to their label
Plus I got my own channel on cable
Always fresh courtside, best view
Kanye west and beats from the neptunes
Stackin cream, magazines
Kids dressed like me on halloween
They lovin' my mixtapes
Money like bill gates
I'm on top and it feels great
It was just my imagination,
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away"
70,Keep Floatin,2011,Best Day Ever (2011),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Keep Floatin Lyrics
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we riding, we smoke till we can't anymore
And keep floatin'
Pass it to your man, roll another one and (keep floatin')
When it's almost done, why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some
Hey, then you can pass that
The kid who rock a snap back
Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract
How we get by, that's how we living in this day and age
I bring colour to this world that's filled with shades of gray
Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some tanqueray
Remember spectating till they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an allstar, blasted out the ballpark
In my lamborghini speeding, you a golf cart
California dream, amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems
These the thoughts weed pull outta me
Blow through a thousand trees
The whole entire crowd could see
Living in what seems to be fiction, I'm on a balcony
I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me
Than light another, this for those who hold it down for me
Passing around the weed, no problems at all
And you haters keep on hating, I ain't talking to y'all
And you can pass, we be floating along
So much smoke we got words high we wrote in the song
Girl I try to come to make you smile
I'm gone so will you wait a while
As soon as I come home we can smoke and then we stay a while
Some people hate my style
Some people love it though
And all these kids that wanna clone they ain't coming close
Politicing joints we countin' none of your votes
I'm getting everybody high so you can puff on ya roach
Shawty used to all these playa's, tell her f-ck with a coach
I just want you to come over, roll me something to smoke
Hey my mind be cooking rhymes up
Living till my times up, hate me then they love me
Tell them try to make they minds up
?, Id was on the beat
It's best to shout the people out that help you get your cheese
Smoking weed, we got no problems at all
All you haters keep on hating
I ain't talking to y'all"

Homie I remember everything,
Every single blunt lit,
Me and my homies we was all up on that dumb shit,
Hittin' that one lick,
Gettin' us dumb rich,
Bein' extra sneaky not leavin' thumb prints,
There was little Mac killin' packs of fun dip,
And my people that been with us since the young kid,
Gettin' caught by my pops blowin' haze.
...Smokin' blunts from my younger through my older days,
Nothin' goes to waste,
Not a day was smashed,
There was doe to make,
And we was makin' cash,
Bangin' rap till the neighbors called the cops,
Beatin' dudes up throwin' mollywops,
Some people say that I'm all just talk,
But I'll tell you everything about the block I walked,
I wasn't cookin' pot, I wasn't tokin' guns,
But I was lookin' high, stayin' smokin' blunts.
Yeah I stole a little bit boy nothin' was cheap,
Santa stayed puttin' that coal under my tree,
And this is peace to my people and peace to my enemies,
But nothin' keeps me alive like my memories...
You make me feel alive, ""These memories keep me alive"",
You are my highest light, ""These memories keepin' me high"",
You make me feel alive, ""These memories keep me alive"",
You are my highest light, ""These memories keepin' me high"",
(Chorus over)
But let's get back to the good ones,
We was just chasin' some women,
Runnin' the game before we playin' an inning,
Now we need that cake to the ceiling,
Cook in the kitchen,
But these, haters is grillin' fill the place up with villains,
'Cause we all just chillin' now,
Got the illest crowed,
Raisin' the roof, uh, breakin' the ceiling down,
I'm iller now then when y'all first heard me,
Peace to the people who listened past the first week,
And there's a lot of y'all,
So let me take a vow,
This to memories,
The drinks is on the house,
We came a long damn way from sittin' on the couch,
Peace to all my honies that was takin' off their blouse,
You'll miss me when I'm out,
Don't leave me when I'm gone,
You hatin' forty-year-olds I'm peein' on your lawn,
I treat you like a jon,
The way I treat a beat,
This ain't everything, but I'll let you sneak a peak."
73,Kickin' Incredibly Dope Shit (Intro),2010,K.I.D.S. (2010),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"When you're young, how much matters
When you find something that you care about
That's all you got, When you go to sleep at night you dreams of music
When you wake up, this is the same thing.
It's right there on your face,
You can't skip it. Sometime when you're young,
The only place to go is inside
Music, Is what I loved, Take that away from me and I really got nothing"

I feel like a million bucks
But my money don't really feel like I do
And from the ground I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm OUT, and money WHAT IM BOUT'
Tryin' to get so much I can't keep count
New kicks give me that ushion like whoopie

Up all night - Johnny Carson
I ain't gotta Benz, no just a Honda
But try to get my money like an Anaconda,

Let 'em in, (knock knock) let 'em in, (knock knock) let 'em in (hey)

Milli vanilli, but this is really how it goes
Mouth my words, don't say shit, shhh
Shut up bitch and ride this dick

All we need is some weed, ho's, and alcohol, hey
Don't forget it when I'm wreckin it
Etiquette the hell of it, smellin it when the L is lit
I'm flyer then a pelican
Young fresh, but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls giving brains, 'cause I'm actin' like a gentleman
In deeper then the water michael phelps was in
Finna have a party baby, you can tell your friends
We the type ... still settin trends
Fuck a job, ima get these damn presidents
1,2,3,4 some crazy-ass kids come and knocked up on your door so
Let 'em in, (knock knock) let 'em in, (knock knock) let 'em in (hey)

75,Kool Aid & Frozen Pizza,2010,K.I.D.S. (2010),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Hey, Kool-Aid and frozen pizza 
It's a work of art, I ain't talking Mona Lisa
Dream of rocking crowds
See me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends, and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more
Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi
Can't believe they eyes swear it's just a mirage
Still got my training wheels in the garage 
But I ain't going to need those I'ma go hard
So far, I've done pretty well for myself
Couple trophies on my shelf, so what else
Could I want that I don't have yet
Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet
So I can go anywhere (Anywhere) anywhere (Anywhere)
Cali for the kush because boy I know there's plenty there
About to be in music stores everywhere but not yet
They can't understand my concept
I been climbing up the Great Wall
Haven't had a fall yet
These blogs got to know I'm on next
Clean conscience, Good Samaritan
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing them
If you didn't know, well I'm from the 'Burgh
Everything I drop recorded by Big Jerm
I smoke herb, and I make music
I don't even talk about it boy I just do it
Everybody got their own opinion
The reasons why they feeling them
You must admit he's killing them
Running off adrenaline
Waiting for the game to want to let him in so open up
The boy a barrel of a smoking gun
Whether I'm old or young, the chosen one
I got a hundred billion flows to come
I hope you know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along
My weed bag empty, bottle at its last drop
I'm feeling like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make cousin
So why the fuck you bugging?"

Oh no, Cam Rellim, haha
Cam Rellim at your service, with these verses
(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
Ay yo I'm park bench chillin', burger patty grillin'
Everybody love to say my name is Rumpelstiltskin
Call up Wolfgang Puck, tell me come and bring a meal in
My stomach full, I'll go against the world like Scott Pilgrim
Way above the building, bungee jumpin' down
They say I'm gettin' trendy like I come after a pound sign
Hashtag Mac, this ain't backpack rap
Give a fuck bout what you sayin' after platinum plated plaques
Take it back, cookin' on them hoes, you can make a casserole
Mad that I can rap so well, and everything on factual
Ain't worth it, if not laughable, I'm off the wall as racquetball
Dick that keep your girl awake all night, they call is Adderall
Youngin' on his grind, workin' harder than your dad work
Black shirt, *Rellim Cam*, that's my name said backwards
Ask first, hell nah, treat em' like a bellhop
Let 'em hold my bags and give a tip for that ass, boy
I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swings
I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Cops comin', muthafucker stay down
Girl I'll be waitin' at the swings
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
Ay yo I'm Blue Park slidin', go-cart drivin'
Got this rap shit down to a science
My Louis belt way nicer than Orion's, confined to an assignment
You won't finish in the kitchen, like appliance
Is just a muthafuckin' kid, say my head is gettin' big
No that's my ego, trippin' somewhere where they need a ski-slope
Rockin' in the fall like a pea-coat, freaks with a deep throat
Students run the class, y'all should keep notes
Drunk then I'm hard to understand, Don Vito
Ace in the Casino, I'm Robert De'Niro
I be low, key though, Young Nino with my jeans low
Your girl love it when I speak slow, she go *moaning*
You can hear the way she's moaning
Started back at midnight, had it till the morning
Wake up with some morning wood
Hit it before work, yeah I'm sure she would
All my female fans like ""I'm sure it's good""
I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground
Never be too old to be chillin' at the playground
Shorty come and kick it at the swings
I'm way too old to be chillin' at the playground
Say I'm too old to be chillin' at the playground

For the pesos, getting bank rolls, I'ma lay low chill, till I let that stack
Yeah people lie, numbers won't
Keep me high, drugs is close
Not growing up, pour a cup
Watch the world go up in smoke
I like my music real loud (real loud)
Can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now)
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud (real loud)
Can you turn that shit up for me right now (right now)
Here she comes, there she go, never chasing after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low"

How the hell you make me fall in love with you?

You lay with me, now you're gone.
All I got is this damn song
(And if you cross your heart)
So I can feel, but I can't touch
You said my love was a bit too much
(I won't deny it)
Broke my heart can't find no crush
So why don't you come on back home?
I'm a f-ckin workaholic with a passion in my heart
Treatin rappin' as an art which you have to be a part of
I just copped a new car to hear it's all up
Try to do the right thing, please karma
All I want to know is where the f-ck did you have to go?
I've been waitin on you baby why don't you leave and come on home
I can't be mad I'm livin' my dream, I've been all around the globe
But you said you think you love me, you need to let me know
So I've been f-cking all these hoes, and I've been blowin' all this cash
And baby this just the beginning, ima make all of it back

All I know: It don't last forever
So take it while you got it try to get a little more
They say I'm gettin' better than I ever been before
Well that's for sure, tell 'em what I do
Rap, keep me fed like a spoon gettin' soup
I've been out here on the road, now they missin' me at home
All these ex girls that I used to know are hittin up my phone
But I ain't here, I guess you can't call back
S-x, drugs and rock and roll, I think ill take all that.

Iraq, Iran, and have them sayin' Mac's the man
The maximum, coming through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door yellin' fuck a list
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this

Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, driving round in my car tonight
Making music that ain't hard to like, I got the heart to write

Motherfucker felt like a grown-up (Soulo)
Momma come and bitch about a curfew
I was still playing round the corner
7 years old saw my first porno
Damn that fucked me up
At 10 I bust my first nut
On this older ho gut, but so what
Let's recap, the earth spinning too rapid
I'm living too fast, sin is a habit
I can't hack fornicate, act as rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
Security guards spark my cigarettes
The old head go 'head and cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look 22
They say you learn when you get older
I just say that that ain't true
That just means when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us fool
Just got L's so I'm riding high
Still in high school but I do
Everything I will do
When I'm 25, no lie
I was young with ambition
Fucked around with these hoes
Never needed permission
Went and lived the life that I chose
Premonition type visions, see the world as it goes
Tell them all what they missing
While I watch as it unfolds
Dodging my death
Confident kid I was trying to grow up with the best
Watching my step
Never know college but could find me nodding off always on test-day
I coulda been a great graduate
Woulda got one of those hoes from the Bachelor
Coulda been smart, coulda been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Falling in love, like she woulda caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, woulda been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fucking Dalai Lama
Only 18 but I got my own business
Then I got fame like what the fuck is this
Whole bunch of cameras, fake ass bitches
Everyone around wanna treat me all different
Oh I'm cool? 'Cause I got money
Back in high school none of the hoes was tryna fuck me
I thought it was a conspiracy
Sometimes my thoughts are scaring me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit for the parakeets
They, they, they was looking for somebody like me
Big bag of weed and a money heist scheme
Something brand new, wonder what it might be
Coughing off them drugs, moving at a nice speed
If you 18 years and older
18 years and older
If you 18 years and older
18 years and older
Take care of my family, take care of my girl
Plant a couple seeds, raising into tress
Went to see a rated R movie about me
They said you must be
18 years and older
18 years and older
18 years and older

18 years and older"

Causing so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that
Ripping people's hearts out, you to cute for that, cute for that

Didn't think I would lose you once I got famous

All going into details
About how you just not happy
And you think you gotta leave so
Go, go

I keep changing like the leaves, hell
Go, go

Wishing that you knew that, you could have these shoes back
Of all of this perfume back, necklaces and jewels back
All the shit you buy me""
She said, ""I want you back
I can't be seen again with you and all of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one
I guess you don't have time
Cause all you do is grind and it's got me loose my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to
Think I'm bout to lose you""
I'mma end this now before things just confuse you
Kept breakin' promises you said you keep

Head to the first dip at the top of the list
Rollin' easy got chu drinks for the free only
And my eyes still chink from the tree
Hoes out the playpen I be on some raybay

Pippens on my feet, they the throw backs
Look, my moneys good but these hoes bad
So they stay attached to my gonads, uh
Waking up to a few L's
Open up my closet to that new shoe smell
I guess I'm going well
Smoking all the weed that I used to sell
But, once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now we selling tapes out my shoe box

I hit it raw while I'm listening to Papoose
No respect cause you wear a V-neck
I mean stress, pressure that could even make Keith sweat
I wish Narnia was on a GPS
I wish Rihanna was DTF
I got rich with these rap songs
Bought a drug problem, now the cash gone
Album filled with all sad songs
But this the one that I can laugh on
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, get 'em
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, get 'em
Girl, shake that body
Girl, shake that body, them ass and totties
I want to see them cankles at my hotel lobby
Bitch, why you so damn snobby?
Your ass flatter than the back of my head
I bought you dinner now it's time to pay me back in some head
Or I'ma have my little sister beat the back of your head
I'm a grade-A douchebag, I'm a dickhead
Asshole area where my gooch sag
Little momma got salty at me, she started talking tough
So I called the Wolf Gang up, they start to bark it up
Popped a hundred mollies, fixed sherm, think I was sparking up
A bottle of Zima, the beamer, I started parking up
Seen my nigga, Mac, and he hopped in the back
And then we jet to Fatburger, ordered some Big Macs
And bitch came with a gauge, and she wanted my fade
But I'm a bitch-ass nigga so I say
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, get 'em
Girl, shake that body
Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, get 'em
Girl, shake that body
T-Dollaz and Mac Meezy, making sure you niggas don't win like referees
Looking for the bitches that love to suck peewee
Herman, I'm a vermin
And you could tell I golf with my hat, man, fuck Thurnis
I'm at IHOP's and eating with Tyler
Drink cocoa then double-team Mariah
But please, don't tell Nick
We were all watching movies at a Motel 6
Like ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
I hope Kendrick fuck Gaga
If Madonna on the Kabbalah
Then me and Snoop could chill and be Rastas
I don't need Prada to show you I'm rich
Pulling out the llama like ""Show me your tits""
Keep crying 'cause I still ain't over my bitch
Oh well...
It'll be OK..."
94,Objects in the Mirror,2013,Watching Movies With the Sound Off (2013),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Some people (oh woah-oh-oh)
Woah-oh-oh (uhn-nuh-unh-nuh)
Yea, people say, people-oh-oh (people-oh-oh)
Say
People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinking about her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What do I have to do to call you mine
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
Yeah, he ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy
So just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sat in silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange
How the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free, once
Baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Leave it all in the rear-view
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Leave it all in the rear-view
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry no more
You don't have to cry no more
You don't have to cry no more, little girl
You don't have to cry
And mend a broken heart girl if you can
But don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is inescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm having some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unobtainable
Don't even say you about to end it all
Your life precious ain't a need to go and kill yourself
I ain't so sure that there's an end it all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top
And, who do you call to make the shootin' stop
Who do you call to give the coupe a wash
After everything I did I think I'd kill myself
So just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away, can you hide away
Sat in silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange
How the times have changed
But I wish, we could go and be free, once
Baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Leave it all in the rear-view
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Leave it all in the rear-view (okay)
Oh-oh-oh
Leave it all in the rear-view
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry
Woah-oh-oh (yeah)
Leave it all in the rear-view
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh"
95,Of the Soul,2011,Blue Slide Park (2011),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Looks like I wrote this song on paper
First time I did that in like 3 years...
My handwriting is horrible and I can barely read this
(Verse 1: mac miller)
Hey, hey, don't even know what's in my head anymore tho
Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, lee corso
Fuckin' girls but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna to figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops suck dog nuts
Arriving to the party in a chariot
Lookin' for a scary bitch that I can pop her cherry pit
I'm very sick, yes very ill
Eternal sunshine, jim carey feel
At the amusement park scared of heights: ferris wheel
Double dare me to kill?
Got some soul like de la do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu
(Verse 2: mac miller)
Wind chimes, sick rhymes, been high on this incline
Tryna get my money stackin' tall, 6'9
Have some caviar, sip wine
Sacrifice insanity, sacrifice normal
Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work 4 bars that are tighter than your corn rows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the 4th row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-
Dontist, manipulating phonics, put 'em into sonnets
Let me put you on this nastier than nas is
Bubonic plague, bacteria that's tryna to find a way
Spread, like yolk from a broken egg
Talkin' shit? you just diggin' your grave
Got some soul like de la do, they say I'm new
It's nothing but some deja-vu
Everywhere you go these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu
(Verse 3: mac miller)
Hypothetically I'm dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, 110 degrees
Visually stunnin', you gotta see it on the led
When I was 17 I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, 3 new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yeah I need my medicine
Fuckin' mary poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met
Some expect me to be the greatest ever
Hear me on the radio, shit'll change forever
Now I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations
I'mma be the best, have some patience
Thought that it was great, then poof!
It was nothing but some deja vu'"

(Verse: Mac Miller)
Pull the hoodie down
And take a look around
Sounds that shook a town
Man it feel good to smile
So I shouldn't frown
When the night is looking down
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the smoothest crook around?
Takin' some dollas
And makin' away from Impalas
Shakin' and jade 'cause they chasin' the face of a robber
Actin' goofy, absolutely
Cause my passion suits me
So blast the tunes please
I see the world with four eyes
Hip-hop tour guide
Hear the war cries: rap or die
I just wanna get signed
Drive a four door ride
Be more fly, till then I'll just soar by
With a wave
I'm a bad indicate
Sit back in the shade
While I'm passin' the haze
Misbehave and I'm a trouble-making teenager
Be prayful he doesn't favor to please haters
Seat taken, three turn Mayor
Gettin' re-elected just three terms later
Uh, I've seen greater days
So let the haters play their game
Dreams fade away when you make the predator the prey
The ace of spade can make it's way to save the day
But from the start a club of heart was diamond
Now I'm in Zion flying through the skyline
The game on my back I got 5 spines
Black cat with 9 lives, time flies
By so I got one life to lose it
But how will I use it?
Uh, I put it all in the music
Cause y'all pussies
Fold away before they hand the cards
Broke-ass rappin' now you Dancin' With The Stars
I'm handling these bars like a simple situation
Based on the cats who don't fit in the equation
Patience is a virtue but fuck it I want it now
Get my record deal ready put Diddy up on the dial like
""Hello, wassup Puffy
I'm on my grind and hungry
Throw me on the table they gonna love me, trust me""
Cause these older cats are gettin' a little rusty
It's time for a change like Barack said
And I don't care
Hip-hop is not dead
Spit hot lead but none of these haters get shot dead
They don't bother me
I'll leave them playing for my wife
Kick back have a laugh while you complainin' 'bout your life
""Grrr"" you hate Mac and you say you gonna fight?
It's all good bro, you entertainment for tonight
Like I'm a be mad?
You hatin' 'cause I'm white
Do a lot a cryin' and leave pain out on the mic
Because overall I'm iller than you all
Y'all pussy
Never ever gone for it all
You scared of a little risky coaching call
What happened?
I thought you were the know-it-all?
I stay smokin' while haze got a potent smell
It take me back to kickin' raps back in Show-And-Tell
I wanted to show people, all of my bro's people
How to come up like: ""Yo, I know people""
Dead Presidents, this doe evil
So lethal the police will want to beat you
Sit you down then have you run your mouth
Bring your mother out: Look what your son is now
(Laughs)
See my mom she know her son is well
The youngest child, she been through it for a while
Now I put 1 on the dial with a smile
'Cause I'm wild, foul child style
Too focused on my grind don't ever catch an ""f""
My hearts in it now even with five seconds left
I want the best won't settle for nothing less
And I always stay dressed in something fresh
So keep your head on strapped and show respect to the game
And that's what this beat messages my brain"
99,One Last Thing,2011,Blue Slide Park (2011),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Everybody wanna ask, where I came from?
Young kid who bang drums, money don't you worry I'mma make some
Somebody changin' the world, it only takes one
Never scared of death, but I ain't ready for that day to come
A million people in the world, I don't hate one
Even them dummies Robbin people with some fake guns
Make mistakes young boy, that's just what I heard
And you don't ever figure out what you don't want at first
I got another verse, invincible and nothing hurts
100 words coming up with what'll have your bubble burst
We can just f-ck, you don't need to take my number first
Gettin' right to it, I ain't really tryna cuddle first
I used to try everything with her, and nothing worked
Got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
These are the days of our lives, and I ain't lyin' kid
Being free, tell me what kind of crime that is
It said it can't let me spit a couple sentences
Always good penmanship, make sure you all remember this
You just entered into Blue Slide Park
The place where dreams comin' true, that's where you find heart
Up until the sun come up, yeah my crew grind hard
See me out throughout the day, but you won't find me in the dark
Say I'm smart with remarks, such remarkable bars
Who knew this music would get me a couple cars
That just sit in park 'cause I'm out somewhere travelin'
Mackin' on the preschool honeys, you were somewhere tattlin'
Mad cause been known to always spaz again
Every single track with him
Oh, he's just so talented
Dream of countin' money till my fingers get some calluses
King with many palaces, a f-cking golden fork to eat my salad with
I observe, asking what did he design
I see an artificial future for a digital mind
Muhammad Ali, yeah I'm him in his prime
Just that normal kid in class who was sittin' behind
Didn't really pay attention though I'm spittin' his rhymes
But now you see his car, tryin' gettin' inside
No
Hell no, haha
I wanna go back home
Late night can't remember what the day's like
Reminiscin' on stop signs and brake lights
Cause it seems that I'm always on the move
When they gonna let me back home
Yeah
I wanna go back home
I wanna go back home"

Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Hey, walkin' out the crib with a smile on my face,
Super hero, utility belt tied around my waist,
Tryna be next, quicker than the reflex,
Chainin' down and Key west,
Every class recess,
N-n-n-ow My pockets deeper than your v-neck,
Hoes up on my dick 'cause I look like Ryan Seacrest,
I'm buzzin' like a bees nest,
Stay up out my beez wax,
My people like to party so I'm always where the freaks at,
Livin' out my dream, people still sleepin',
The best night of your life, but we do this every weekend,
Life couldn't get better, I hope it lasts forever,
When I spit my verse they gon' remember every letter like
Day in, and day out,
We tryna get this cake now,
You think you fly just wait until I pull my cape out,
Hey, life is good don't waste it,
We ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces,

Hey, they seem surprised, with the look that's in their eyes,
How I could be myself and do away with their disguise,
I advise, homies to stay homies,
Few people you can trust, all the OG's told me,
When I was just a shawty, strummin' my guitar,
Playin' my piano, had a band in my garage,
Sittin' down with the homies, playin' Playstation,
Tryna find a crib where their parents on vacation,
Hey, why you grillin' put a smile on your face bitch,
We takin' shots all around gettin' wasted,
Came along way from freestylin' in my basement,
Show some love to the people that I came with,
Cause day in and day out,
We tryna get this cake now,
You think you fly just wait until I pull my cape out
Hey, life is good don't waste it
We ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces

My fam's still the only people that really know me for who I am
Damn, got me askin' when I got this fly
The type to change because of fame, I'm just not that guy
Still sippin' on my 40 when the cops drove by
When I go, gotta tell my girl to stop, don't cry
See, I-I-I been buyin' these diamonds
All designer clothes and a Benz just to drive in
Autograph signin' must've got to my head
Fuck that, I've been the same lil' mofucka
Always down to share my shit, melody with snare kick
So I don't give a fuck about some lames I rode the ferry with
My larynx is imperative to live, music's what I need, boy
Destroy all of these fake me's, they decoys
Everywhere I go, these companies give me free toys
These random strangers just treatin' me like we boys
Pennsylvania nights, 9:30 flights
Thinking to myself, where does all this go?
No time to care, more I can share
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know, this is all I know
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit
So make a toast to the good life
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
Hey, hey, 10,000 dollar hands, billion dollar plan
Listenin' to jams while I'm sittin' in my van
This is who I am, wrote these lyrics on my DNA code
Happy as hell, MDMA, yo!
Fuck a job, there ain't no one that I call my boss
We just tryna work so we can blow up like a molotov
And it kinda wake me up like a coffee shop
Thinkin' bout my people who was murdered in the Holocaust
Got me thankful just for life by itself
And there's way more people here I should be tryna to help
Am I wrong for spendin' money how I do, probably yes
It's just funny old people see the logo on my chest
You got ya thumb held high, we can be friends
Other people pretend, we hang out on the weekends
These fuckers lil' bit creepy, so we just leave them
Say get some rest, when I die, I'mma sleep in
Pennsylvania nights, 9:30 flights
Thinking to myself, where does all this go?
No time to care, more I can share
By now, this life is all I know
So this is all I know, this is all I know
Taught myself to walk, then got up and took flight
Hey, bullshit's always gonna be bullshit
So make a toast to the good life"
104,Paper Route,2010,K.I.D.S. (2010),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Ay Yo you thirsty?
Hellz ya I'm fucking dehydrated
You got any money
Three pennies and a bar of lint kid
Chevy please let me roll this weed up
The the main event so watch people pull they seats up
Bottle of some gin lets just hit a couple freaks up
Ima take one home and have her singing like the glee club

So you know I'm at the show looking good for theses hoes

Yeah you smokin' good but we probably smokin' better
151 takin' shots with no barretta

With a drink getting drunk havin' one night flings
This is Pittsburgh home of the six rings
We getting money now all we here Cha Ching
And we do anything to get this paper so they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit we ain't got later 'cause we down here on this road
And we do anything to get this paper so they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit we ain't got later 'cause we down here on this road
Cool ass, fly around chillen young fool
Gin cups sippen that's me, that's what I do
I got the gang in my bloodstream, strong how I'm livin'
And I'm G'd up so now they just throwin' away the kitten (it's real)
I swear you hella bad the younger mac tell me 'bout you
But we cool if you stuck up we could go without you
We on the money we schooling you know we be the block
I swear the homie gotta gift so he don't need the block
Zig Zag papers, king size
Smoking chillin' in angery cars, mean rides
Pops was a hustler and moms ran track
So tell me what you get in me when you mix that
I just sit back light minds
And middle finger you suckers with my nice rhymes
So whether home or the road
We gettin' dough it follow us everywhere that we go
And we do anything to get this paper so they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit we ain't got later 'cause we down here on this road
And we do anything to get this paper so they follow everywhere we go
So for the bullshit we ain't got later 'cause we down here on this road"
105,Party On Fifth Ave.,2011,Blue Slide Park (2011),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"I think I see where you're goin' with this one E
Hey, hey, been around the world and back, yeah I did that
Still kick raps in cars and packs, so where's my kids at?
And everybody hatin' sounded funnier than Sinbad
I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the kids that she warned you about
We just storm in your house open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of styles, just be sure that it's wild
6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you mane
If you tryna to party let me see you raise your hand
There's a party on 5th ave (a party on 5th ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like 20
I'mma hump it and come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road
Make you sure you gotta
Clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
We're just about there you choose
We're at the party on 5th ave tonight
And that's what I'm tryna do
Hey, what's the difference between me and you?
When no one believe in you, I'm flyer than beetle juice
""DJ Enuff"", But still I might eat your food
I party and sleep till noon, what every day people do
Give me a week or two
See when you read the news my bitch
My rhyme time is why, my album is fly
Your favorite record, you gonna put it aside
This that old school shit soundin' good in the ride
And I'm only countin' to nine
Said this that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride
Said let's head out to the party I'll drive
There's a party on 5th ave (a party on 5th ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like 20
I'mma hump it and come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road
Make you sure you gotta
Clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
We're just about there you choose
We're at the party on 5th ave tonight
And that's what I'm tryna do
What's goin' on? There's a party
Hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gonna do that now
My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on
My light up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This ain't a time to just sit back
Cause, there's a party on 5th ave
There's a party on 5th ave (a party on 5th ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like 20
I'mma hump it and come runnin', 'cause we gotta hit the road

PA to BK
Skyzoo
Easy Mac
S.K.Y.Z.O.O
I love money, I love money.
You take a buck from me, you doug funny.
I said I love money, I love money.
You take a buck from me, better duck dummy.
(Mac Miller)
I'm with my man Skyzoo, is the class clown of his high school.
Dround you in typhoons, hittin' you with rhymes too
Haters keeps they eyes glued, pound if you my dude,
We stay high like Einstein's IQ
And y'all muther fuckas know where I'm comin' from
Chewin' cats up, like a little piece of bubble gum.
Tryin' double sum's, hustle, wanna let my money run.
I ain't even battling dude, I'm having fun with it.
Jokes make him feel wrong in his own skin,
Sippin gin from a bin that's makin' my dome spin.
And your the type that'd try to take from your own kin.
Feel it close on your toes, hangin' from clothes pins.
I'm spittin' blades, God damn it, my tooth hurts.
I'm out feelin' with a bunch of cancerous tumors.
Yup, music's my baby, I ain't gonna, lose her.
So I stay with the radio, like Cuba Gooding Junior.
Who you think could bother me lyrically?
In the middle of Alaska I bring the heat.
My worst verse hot as your best ryhm, Damn.
The pen game insane
Who you think could bother me lyrically?
In the middle of Alaska I bring the heat.
My worst verse hot as your best ryhm, Damn.
The pen game insane
(Skyzoo)
I'm one drink away from everything you meant to say
Like I think he on the rise of what the kings made
And in the blink of an eye I'm on the kings page
But no album, this is all for the mixtapes
In a different lane, no signs of road rage, ain't no body over here to rage quit, so no gains
No sleep, no retreat, no surrender, no apologies from me,
I'm the pen of the penners
I mean what I speak, so if I given you a sentence,
Then it bez what it bez, nothing hit on the agenda,
You leave it up to me, and you can divy up the team,
Put your pride in end and I'm dismember your limbers
The harder the city, the starting point guard, that can play up to the fall,
So the parts is all gone, no room on the bench,
And I got a no trade clause, so I'm here long haul no switchin
Who you think could bother me lyrically?
In the middle of Alaska I bring the heat.
My worst verse hot as your best ryhm, Damn.
The pen game insane.
Who you think could bother me lyrically?
In the middle of Alaska I bring the heat.
My worst verse hot as your best ryhm, Damn.
The pen game insane.
(Mac Miller)
Look, I rip mics to piece cook 'em or eat 'em raw
I was bustin' freestyles before I could read it all
MCs just call me the monster in their mind that haunt them all the time
And they thought if they could ryhm they could make the situation a lil different then the present
See, I fucked this track, worried thought I got her pregnant,
I'm haulin ass, y'all is whack, taking out the garbage trash,
Duckin from these sharks 'n' crabs, giving MCs heart attacks,
Its yo boy Mac, damn I'm great, and you guessed, no love like a man with aids,
I feel you dancin gays with some hand grenades, drop bombs, remove your hands and legs,
And I pray dear Lord please give me the strenghth not put these little stakes in their taint till they faint,
Suffocating, now you choke you a broke MC, now ain't nothing to do but smoke your weed like...
Who you think could bother me lyrically?
In the middle of Alaska I bring the heat.
My worst verse hot as your best ryhm, Damn.
The pen game insane.
Who you think could bother me lyrically?
In the middle of Alaska I bring the heat.
My worst verse hot as your best ryhm, Damn.
The pen game insane.
Any problems with the lyrics, please leave a comment or message me.
Thank you, Hope you enjoyed.

107,People Under The Stairs,2011,"I Love Life, Thank You (2011)",Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Hey microphone testing,
Testing you playin' politician
You martin she on the west wing
Guessing the best thing for me to do is spit it
This shit is never a gimmick you listen more than a minute of it
Iv been spitting flows since the kid was 6 years old
And if you listen close I'll do this like some mismatches clothes
Its whatever put in together-
You never could be this clever,
I'm rockin' the mic forever
You gonna stop me never.
I'm cocky because I love it, you rocky without the punches,
Hockey without the ice and boxes without the lunches
Flowing like me, no one and that got you mad bitch,
So your boys are nothing but just air rich,
I ain't tellin' nobody how they should live they life
I got my own shit to deal with, so that just isint right
I'm just tryin' to leave the crib go out and live the night shift,
Fuck that, I'm locked in the lab working
Dropping the track beats,
Get bodied and bags certain
See the world through 1st 2nd and 3rd person,
Omniscient listening so efficient,
Trapped in my own goal line ready to go the distance,
Consider it a privilege
That what you got to witness
History in the makin'
You fuckin' bitches, just playin' with y'all
Still in line waiting for my name to get called, yaa"
108,Perfect Circle / God Speed,2015,GO:OD AM (2015),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"(Perfect Circle)
(Fuck you)
I came for whoever is in charge
I suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard
They need some coffee, everybody's sleeping on me
Going around door to door, setting off alarms
All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways (no emergency)
I moved up from a Private to a Sargent
You can see it in the scar face
Hidden in a dark place, swimming in the shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in an arcade
(Time crisis) Not a second to lose
I'm the motherfuckin' Bible, that's forever the truth
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues
The devil with me and he tell me to shoot
Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do)
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)
Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday
Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway
Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
Hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I'm in it in an instant like replay
Bra's a baton, pass it off like relay
Why I'm so mad on my B-Day?
She say ""I thought you got sober""
And I say ""I wish you'd stop being a bitch
And get to minding your business""
Told me ""Money has changed you""
I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?
How'd I get so egotistical? I'm a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I'm only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it'll forever be
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies
Murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)
A goddess told me ""good morning"" when I woke up
(Fuck you)
You know I had a good morning when I woke up
(Fuck you)
Gotta thank God every morning then I woke up
(Fuck you)
Would you remember me if I never woke up?
Bye bye (Fuck you)
I am a sinner, I'm just tryna sin
Warm in the winter, and I'll be on my way
I'm just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers
I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind
Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system 412-9... is not available
""Hey man, I wish you were here, happy holidays, uhm, I love ya.
And I hope you have a good night / weekend / I hope I talk to you soon, alright, God Speed""
(God Speed)
Oh yeah, I thought I'd have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past right now
Me and the homies would be sitting on millions
Reminiscing when we were so broke and living in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I'd have it in the bag by now
I thought that we'd be kicking back by now
I know that life is a bitch, I know that life is a bitch
I thought we'd put her in a cab by now
But I'm stressing, I can't relax
I swallow my pride and I'm higher than what's making me mad
Everybody say I need rehab
'Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on and won't be long till they watching me crash
And they don't wanna see that
They don't want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Telling her they could have done more to help me, and she'll be crying saying that she'll do anything to have me back
All the nights I'm losing sleep, it was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbing them dark times
Them pills that I'm popping, I need to man up
It's a problem, I need a wake up
Before one morning I don't wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I'm too obsessed with going down as a great one
And if you wait too long, they go find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter, to all my brothers, Most Dope, that's forever
And this the part that Q start crying, if he ain't already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me time I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there's a place
Where all my people free and everybody straight
Every devil don't got horns, and every hero don't got capes
Opened up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake, Good morning
Yeah, good morning
Yo man, it's the morning, you gotta go to work
""Alright""
Yo, you gotta be at work in like ten minutes, yo
(You good?)
""I'm straight, yo what's good?"" (when you going?)
You gotta pick up the dry cleaning and shit still?
""Man, fuck that shit, I'll skip""
You bout to go to work?
Ight, what time you gotta be at work?
""I don't know... soon""
You Democrat or Republican?
""Uuh... I don't know anymore""
Would you vote for a female president?

I said it's funky mac I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right.
I came to rock right now

I've been known to rock a microphone
She got a boyfriend but left him home
See I got style, so yes I brag
The things I do just make them mad
Download new kicks to my ipad
Why ya girlfriend look like she's dressed in drag
You a fag, this is forever, ladys in love with my agenda
My names something these girls remember
She write hers down, return to sender
I don't need it, thinking she can keep her secrets
One night only that's how I treat this, sleepin'
Bitch please make me some breakfest
And then leave.

So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's funky mac I don't play no game

Girls odishon to bring them home

Her mom adores me, her dad thinks I'm a nitwit
It don't really matter I'ma have her fall in love
I need my botty brains botty? and she all of the above
Relationships, I hate that shit
Got one night only so make it quick
You see me out, wanna take a pic
Fuck me once, wanna date and shit.

110,Poppy,2010,K.I.D.S. (2010),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Yeah
Had to do this one
One time.
Hello Death, it seems that we meet again.
You keep takin' friends that I'll never see again.
I guess they gotta leave but if we pretend that they never left,
Well we gon' see 'em then
Never leave our heart, never leave our thoughts.
As time goes by, they'll never be forgot.
Life goes on, though I wish that they was there.
Shit like this never gonna seem fair, yeah.
So can I have a moment of silence for anyone who's gone from the coldness of violence.
And I know you wanna see me go to college,
But I'm sorry I don't think that Ima make it.
Because this world is mine for the takin',
So when I get famous they gon' know what your name is.
And no one understand what the pain is,
And how the blood run numb where my veins is.
I'd like to thank you, 'cause you made me a man.
Told me to never let it go, so I'm takin' a stand.
Always in the crowd when I played in the band.
Your grandson is everything I say that I am.
But maybe I am a little bit over my head,
But I'm feelin' so alone tryin' to cope with your death.
Holdin' my breath, wishin I had one more day.
Wishin' you could be there when I graduate.
Uh, and it's sad to say, that no one in this room understand me.
I know you had to leave, so rest in pease.
But please, can you watch over nanny.
'Cause she loved you, and I love you.
All the prayers I'm sayin' may bug you.
But I'm just checkin' in on what you up to.
So, how they treatin you up there?
Too stubborn for a cane, way to cool.
Sleepin' at your house, walkin' me to school.
Thought I was a fool when my grades started slippin.
When I played ball you was always in admission.
You, loved me more than I've been loved before.
And that's the type of thing that everyone ignores.
But not me, you got me.
Always and forever.
Time goes by, goin' without you.
Hope you know I've been thinkin' about you.
And I know, I know, I know, I know that they took you from your home.
But you're in my heart, so I'm never gonna be alone.
Time goes by, goin' without you.
Hope you know I've been thinkin' about you.
And I know, I know, I know, I know that they took you from your home.
But you're in my heart, so I'm never gonna be alone."
111,Put It On,2011,On and On and Beyond (2011),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"I kinda feel like I deserve this
Butterflies all up in my stomach, like a first kiss
Just a word smith, using poetry and more but,
Distracted by these girls who want their juicy couture
Yeah, this life is all about material things
I got kids tricks, bitch I'm the cereal king
And everything better if you relax and and chill
So my seat back for weed naps, we need that, for real
I took my heart and put it all out on a CD
You now riockin with the bees knees, I'm the cats pajamas, the coolest of the cool
The kid that got em' gas tappin usin' up they fuel
When they first heard 'em spit they didn't think it would be shit
M-o-s-t to the d-o-p-e kids
C u f'in h's now you hanging with a g bitch but they say you need Jesus
All my peoples
All of my peoples
Everything is a-okay
We been waitin way too long
So tell the DJ he can play my song
Ay, yo I'm half man half amazin
Flyer than a penguin, you dryer than a raisin
Hot like causan, bringing all the girls to the days inn, ready for a little love makin'
Yeah, I want it now but they tell me have some patience
Feelin' on top of the world since graduation
Now I do music all day cause there ain't no other option
Drivin' to Connecticut, then flyin' up to Boston
I put it on for my city, always showin' love
An overdose of drugs, how the people throwin' up?
They say waddup when I drop in
I'm just chillin' back in my seat, Joe Swanson
Yeah I used to steal iPods and pawn them
Now I take my girl shoppin', no problem
Live it up every second, life don't got a sequel
It's all good, thumbs up to my people
All my peoples
All of my peoples
Everything is a-okay
We been waitin way too long
So tell the DJ he can play my song
Put It On."
112,ROS,2015,GO:OD AM (2015),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Good evening everybody
How's everybody doing
Just wanna ask a question, have you... have you
Have you been in love before
You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should probably take your heels off
Cause you've been running through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain, these days of rain
You're playing games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still trying to find you
I'm looking for you babe
And I'm still trying to find you
Through sunshine or rain
Yeah, you got your stained glass iris
Diamond behind your eyelids
Autopilot fly
My heart skipped a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date let's take it easy
Love is power, swear there's something about her that make me nervous
Mother earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl you know I'm loving you just like you deserve it
So baby make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug and love to death
Feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream
So fuck the world it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If love don't last forever then forever ain't the same
Your love is not too kind to me
The only thing on my mind is she
My love, my love, my love, my love
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
And she is cool, calm and collected
I knew that you was the one when I seen you leave me breathless
A-okay I need a second day today, give me attention
I want to take care of you
Marry you, something I'm prepared to, there can't be two
You was here I ran from you
Scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you not
You up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession
I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong, everything you do is right
Let's start a family, hold on to forever baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen, look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love, that love was record breaking
I'm sick of waiting
Your love is not too kind to me
The only thing on my mind is she
My love, my love, my love, my love
And I know that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
So gimme all your love
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine
Gimme all of your love
You will be mine through rain and through shine
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah"
113,Red Dot Music,2013,Watching Movies With the Sound Off (2013),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Think I can see a fucking halo
About to meet my maker
Brought a double cup of Drano
Some soda for the flavor, uncontrollable behavior
With some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbor with the bitches, he got special needs
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe
They got my soul, bu I don't let them take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored, me and Action rapping
I'll be fucking with the Fader, sipping mind eraser
Actually, we rapping for the fuck of it
Taking money from you, gonna smack you out in public
We the republican government, abundance of substance
Having consumption to fuck a bitch
You're Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch looking like Cousin Itt, the ugliest
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wildin' up to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, gortex in case of drizzle
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?
Yo, I don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first
After rapping take my people out for octopus
We all deserve a dedication to the fandom
Hold your hand out for nothing if you claim to be my man, damn
You see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
Blow the dice, roll them shits, hit another trip
Shit, I'm on some shit
Hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the six in the summertime
Understand I'm only rhyming for this son of mine
And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
We ate the tuna, it's suede puma, my look is Jay Buhner
Dawg it's cause some of us just age sooner
I'm still twisted, rocking lizards from a strange river
Forbidden jungle in the joint paper, point shaver
Check the bio, I fixed the game between Kentucky and Miami of Ohio
I been wild
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wildin' up to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is gettin' whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, gortex in case of drizzle
I said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?
Bitch I'm nodding enough, I'm hot as wassabi sauce
And constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
I was a minor, chasing after vagina
None of my friends were fake, but none of my clothes designer
Went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
I came from that basement, now look at this view
Making this money, blowing it all
Fuck what you did, just show me results
Yo I'm a 635, dip or fly motherfucker
Leather to the foot, horses I led them to the brook
If you like to keep the chisel in the book
I see a lion in the mirror when I look
Look, I lose money but I make it back
I keep it true and ain't no motherfucking faking that
I get a-fadin' and then I fade to black
Been on the razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat
I said it must be the drugs...
You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name says ""crack dealing trap nigga
Slash cat peeler, back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers""
And half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixer
Taps slicker than past tiller
Goes around the room like his cats get finna
Oh you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
Yoohoo, I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure to look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you Beastie Boy
You can't match a killer with that wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Triller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ass sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from
Malcolm, I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King,
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey row
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You're a bully's Best Day Ever
With them Nike's on your feet
Coming through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga don't give me that shit
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?"

I hope you're proud of me
Dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories
Like they were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people full of me
Are you made of
I guess I'm fooling myself too
There's just a bunch of shit
I wish I could tell you, but
This life move fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted
The dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now I need to run to to any place that the train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate, sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)
I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all,
We'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia,
Lost somewhere out in
West Virginia
It's a dark science, when your friends start dying
Like how could he go, he was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dried in
Couple years are goin' by, by then
Can you please help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't answer
You don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Life is short, don't ever question the length
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate thought, go 'head just give it a shot
You'll remember shit you've forgot
Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
And when the world's looking hopeless
I'ma still hold shit down
I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all,
We'd talk about the life we lived
In West Virginia,
Lost somewhere out in

Heaven is a crime scene, stand behind the yellow tape
I started making money in eleventh grade
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space
Shit was so different in 2008
Growing pains, fill the open veins with Novocain
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain
I'm just rambling
You want war, send N64 Blitz champions (Sucker)
Out of space channeling, brain damaging
Heavy rain game cancelling, proud to be American
They tell me ""Get yourself straight
How much more money can you make?""
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich
Maybe get married to a local bitch
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit

Now it's rush hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker
I stuck around for the past six summers
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya
We was in the attic you could smell the weed
Bitches getting naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissing bitches just like Ellen D
In the kitchen whipping biscuits, giving generously
I thank the lord I made it out, no STD
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs

And I want you to know
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining
Know what I'm talking about

If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep
Watching Dawson's Creek till I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm under water in my dreams
I'm in awe, this jigsaw, puzzles not complete
I'm just an idea, nothing concrete
Came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hatin' on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
I'm no god, I don't think that I'm a human, though 'cause I'm so odd
People sellin' drugs 'cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan

Sipping Jameson like I majored in whiskey flavouring
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off and leave it dangling
FlyLo's still tryna put me on to Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I ain't nobody, and neither are you
Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth
I'm so stubborn, I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
All your songs are sixteen's and a hook
We're here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm down for the movement, trying not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist tryna consume the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in an igloo
I hear the fish biting nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown, poo

Know the bullshit and all the problems
But we to gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give them what they need
Just wakin' up and gettin' stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup up in my bottle
Damn, but it's okay
I top it off with scrambled eggs
Aye gotta work with watcha got

And let's chill on the couch
See what's on the telly
Where we won't leave house
Can ya stay a while
Can ya stay a while
Cause girl I'm feelin' lazy and I'm tryna hang around
Ain't tryna get out of my bed till noon
Neighbors smell the perfume smoke in my room
And I got the door closed can't be sure though
Amsterdam weed spending euro's
Get the herb rolled
Let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escaped the world
Escaped the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
'Cause we gonna handle that later
We gonna handle that later
Right now let's get that paper and smile for all them haters
Aye cream cheese and a bagel
Have a glass of milk and an ego
I'm rockin' pjs and no shirt
I smoke weed eat yogurt

Enjoy the best things in your life

Listening to music, haven't slept in like 5 days
I tried to take a nap, lean my head against the window
It feels real I swear to God this shit pretend tho'
Cause me I get high and make music for a living
If that ain't the best job then give me your opinion
'Cause I love life, chilling for the night, case of budlight
Small World for me but you, you live a bugs life
Scared to chase your dreams, scared to take a risk
Think its make believe, so you hate the shit
Valentine love it, grimier then rubbish
You softer then a snuggie and you sweeter then a Sunkist
Never eating beats on your thug shit
Come with all the swagger but you lacking all the substance
Cool, the dude you used to wanna be in school spending money, drinking liquor, naked girls up in my pool
Wake up in my bed gettin' head she said
The act so cool but she easily impressed
I love to lay back watch her while she get dressed
Put herself together, last night was a mess, yes
Today a new day, a fresh start, if you didn't make mistakes you wouldn't get far
Life get hard, so we get high, you ain't shit till you try

Sweeter than creme brulee, presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka since before I hit the seventh grade
Elevate, who the shit, cooler than what coolest is

Underage table in the back, smokin', drinkin' yak

On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball
After all, only get one life, so there's no time to stall

Are you ready? Are you ready?
Terrified but my hands are steady
Verify get the camera ready
Carry my own weight all these earthquakes don't wait
Need up from this sleep diving into this cold lake

Disguise the emotion no face bull shit with that no thanks
Dealing with her since 08 fucked around I'm done
I heard your suppose to race when you hear the sound of that gun
Now it's losing all of it's fun spending days in solitude
Too many dumb interviews put me in this awful mood
Not thinking logical getting high jump off the moon
Looked right into his soul when he died right there in the hospital
Peace don't seem possible when the mind is so close
Came in for your money then left with all your hoes
Life moves fast but my paper keeps it slow
Open up your mind and start forgetting what you know (Oh!)
This shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone (Whoa!)
You move so good
Girl you let it hurt so good
Uh love me love me then trippin' on ignore me
Beautiful to get ugly turn you into a drunky
Still searching for something but I don't know what
Dreaming about nothing wake you up and then fuck
I love it when you get a little nasty
Hit it from the back if you like that wiggle them ass checks
Isn't that sweet same shit you did last week
For all the cash you might of stood up and would've walked past me
Wake me up from this bad dream put a match to this gasoline
Every night you somebody different got me thinking it's Halloween
Fucked up can't feel myself work hard might kill myself
Exist through audio where all my problems out-wear themselves
Trapped in this wish and well death creeping like sprinter cell
Getting high put my mind away find the words I'm try'na say
I'mma think of that later when the world goes against you
You better get that paper

I sound like the new.
I sound like the motherfucking future.
So if you ain't listenin',
Don't ask what I sound like.
But if you know,
Then you closer to the future.

126,Sunlight,2012,Macadelic (2012),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Uhhhah
Top of the morning to you
You know, it's been so dark outside
That I figured I'd turn a couple motherfuckin' lights on real quick
(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
Uh, I ain't talkin' 'bout nothin' with a flow so disgutin'
Ashtray by me that I gotta dump my guts in
Need substance, feed it to the public
No one gon' touch it like my poppy's old musket
Roll up to the function, eatin' all the Funyuns
Sentence keep runnin', word the double E Cummings
People say to me that it doesn't mean nothin'
Bumble bees buzzin' cause the trouble needs lovin'
Wonder who really give a fuck what I have to say?
Those are people that which I dedicate this rap today
If I have to, I'mma crack your face
Monday to Saturday, I'm actin' like a basket case
While Sunday I'm goin' golfin' with my Callaway's
Or watchin' football, word to Joey Galloway
Take a shower start singin' like Al Green
From outside, it probably soundin' like some loud screams
Always had child dreams and nightmares
My music like the airport I hop on a flight there
Wana go to Monaco to see what it's like there
Roll up in a pair of Nike Airs, just like 'Yeah'
Wassup, here I am, lookin' in the mirror and
All I see is me, I'm in peace
Go rent out a penthouse, forget all my problems
The things I regret now, be gone by the mornin'
My life is startin', I'm ready as I ever been
Pencilin' my schedule that I gotta move on from mistakes
Number 1 albums, always givin' you mixtapes
And that's what Ima do until I'm richer than Bill Gates
It ain't all about money for me though
I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego
Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend though
Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to Cee Lo
Bottles of Cleco, a couple of Cristal
May head to L.A like I'm Chris Paul
Bout to go platinum off of missed calls
So all of y'all can lick balls
Yeuh
Just you know
Run from the dark
Into the light
You know, you know you're gona find your way out
Run from the dark
Into the light
Oh-whoa, you know you're gona find your way
That's right, into the sunlight (x4)"
127,Suplexes Inside of Complexes and Duplexes,2013,Watching Movies With the Sound Off (2013),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Might as well introduce
This is madness!
This is an outrage
As a matter of fact, this is outrageous
Yeah, young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer
Rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina
Like I want kids, my head continues to be haunted
I burn a city down while I'm unconscious, baby go on
Take some quaaludes, conversate with Jesus
Batting practice with the motherfucking ghost of Babe Ruth
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful
Devil on my trails, I'm trying to find the Holy Grail
Right there
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target
Then I don't know why I even started
I'm sick of being too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light
Told myself, ""Fuck the world kid, just do what you like""
Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life
You're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity
But all those big words ain't gonna get you paid
And those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid
You got it made in that mad house
What the fuck you got to be sad about? Go ahead and rap now
Do what you do best, I mean
That's what you do best, matter fact motherfucker
You suit vest, you need to buy a new dress
I heard you and your girl live in a duplex
I'ma put her ass in a Suplex, the sun east, the moon west
You got a clue, what does a clue get?
Nothing
My milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the wicked witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard
Now the whole world's in color, still,
How Auntie Em was next of kin and not her mother
Real, her face was care-worn
I suspected she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch since the very beginning of Year One
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the poems and songs of Ecclesiastes
Lightning should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell ""Hear, hear"", finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant,
So miss me with the irrelevant, the god body is heaven-sent
The hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford
Brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal
Every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca
Shout out to Tony Toca, we livin' how we supposed to"
128,Swing Set,2009,The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown (2009),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Crusing through the city with the windows down blowing
Through a pound ready for another round
Some h*es in the back of the whip and they rollin' servin'
Pussy like the U.S Open blowin' on this
Potent different flavors I done saw 'em all I bee stayin
Higher than the taj mahal straight epic
So now you can't forget it kickin girls out the crib
Like they got some bad credit when you blowed
And you drunk and you don't give a fuck take this soul
And this funk tell the DJ turn it up purple
Stuff got it stirrin in my cup while ho*es I get around
Like the wheels on the bus I'm'a true player
Original mac and I keep the pussy poppin' here listen
To that h*es showin me some love so I'm givin'
It back she wanna be mrs.mac how you figure that?"

130,The Festival,2015,GO:OD AM (2015),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"Yeah, yeah
Let me get a little bit more beat
Yeah
Ask god if she believe in me and will she accept me as a deity
And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free
I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave
I took a nap, I need a tree in the shade
Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass
Picturing the images that make you laugh
I left you out to die but will you take me back
Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious
She's naked underneath them shadows, let the sunlight undress her slow
I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doing impressions though
I'm going to the festival, the festival need to let me go
I wake up, pop a couple Benadrylls, go back to sleep
So I made up, everything they said was real, it has to be
Cause actually the master fast asleep
And the castles back back in his private quarters
That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order
All this torture, thought I had to warn you
Leave it all behind and go to California
I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzing this feeling
You can't fathom
(Little Dragon:)
My hands are ahead the clouds
From the clap-clap thunder looking down
While you're running around
I lift you up when you drown
Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation
Full speed chasing and you're always running ahead
You're always running ahead
You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances
And you paddle like a duckling, why
Don't wanna go, don't wanna go, don't wanna go to the festival
You got angels, we can see them dripping from the sky
You watch 'em with your third eye
Don't wanna go, don't wanna go, don't wanna go to the festival
To the festival
Hola, Malcolm. Hey man, it's Lois man. I'm calling, man, to tell you about the album.
I listened, it's good. I need to tell you, man. I tell everyone to listen to the music and it sound like they like it, man.
It sound like it good. I tell my wife ""I'm so proud of him."" I tell my girlfriend ""I'm so proud of him.""
And the album is good. It's so good. I cannot believe it. No one can beat you"

I like sitting in shotgun deuce on an L, parents not caring 'cause they used to the smell.
Classy ass women, fresh ass linen, hot summer dayz w/a pool I can swim in, a good spot to kick it, a case of 40s,
Them homies always havin' good stories, the beer bottles with the twist off caps, when old people tell that you they listen to rap,
I love days I can sleep in, 4 day weekends, hoes puttin' they clothes back on you peekin, blunt rides w/the mixtape bumpin. I love makin' love in public, n when the hip hop legend tour comin' to ur town, findin a crispy ass 20 on the ground, walkin' when the sun out, watchin runs house, reaction movies when the villain pull his gun outtt.

Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill

Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch
Grandma getting crunked, just fine
Nobody give a fuck
All these days already gone by
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
(Verse 1 - Mac Miller)
The door's open, I might as well just stroll in
Got some Arnie Palmer in my pitcher: call it Nolan
Ryan, try it once and then you go there
I am hoping that we can kick it
Reminiscing only about the good times
I know there's moments
When you probably love me but you didn't wanna show it
Now I'm all around the globe
With everyone but you
I know you fuckin' miss me
Chill and keep it cool! Never getting old mane
Grown, no Rogaine. Boy you play with all that food
You better eat the whole thing!
It's a family reunion, all the grandmas be moving
Running in 3-legged races people would cry if they losing
When I was 2, my fly was blue
When I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand
When my, bike was all I was riding on
Jewelry from a Happy Meal, fuck it I was happy still

Come and, step inside the Electric Slide
Spraying squirt guns at you like it's pesticides
So why you buggin'... lil man stop bugging...
I gotta, spend some time, with some friends of mine
Get away from everything, go and rest your mind
It's not nothing ... lil man it's not nothing ...
All my little cousins acting like some munchkins
Running in the trees and they're crying out their eyes
Have to rush 'em to the ER - maybe just a Band-Aid will do it
You can sing along please, let the band play the music
Always nice when you come back home
Your friends go off but then they come back grown
Nice to know that you're never alone
Family reunions whenever I'm home ...

Morning after, my lungs hurt
Eat your pussy just to show you how my tongue works
It's funny how we fuck but fell in love first
Been three years, I wish I finally trust her
She make me feel like how them drugs work
Itchin' from my fixture when she go and love hurts
I just get a temper, I just need somebody I can vent to
Someone get me stoned, be my Emma
Left your lipstick on the glass of your daiquiri
Ruby red usually end up tragically
Work of art, you can be my masterpiece
But you fast asleep
Something 'bout the pain
Makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs
Never felt like this before
I hope one day it all makes sense
It'll all make sense
You can have it all
Tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
Uh now she wake up
Cryin' while she puttin' on her makeup
Trapped inside her love for me
And no escape for her
You wanna leave say the word
But she can't
Lookin' in my eyes
""Is everything okay"", she lies
Put on her disguise, play it safe
'Cause We've been fightin' for the past three weeks
She keep this one inside, she don't wanna seem weak
Strong, baby tell me what's been goin' on
I don't wanna be so alone
So you gotta get me high again
I got all this money we could try to spend
Until we strung out like a violin
Come back to life, then we die again
Little angel, where's your halo?
Somewhere above them horns
Something 'bout the pain
Makes me want more
Done a lotta drugs
Never felt like this before
I hope one day it all makes sense
It'll all make sense
You can have it all
Tell me what you need
Believin' all them silly things you read
I hope one day it all makes sense
One day it'll all make sense
You get me high girl, scared of overdose
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose
May I propose a toast?
Someone usually does, to our fucked up love
You get me high girl, scared of overdose
I don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose
Propose a toast

Wonder who the f-ck I am
Uh, Yeah, want you to feel it
My voice probably sounds mad raspy right now
I want you all to feel it
So step up on the mic and uh
Show them what you got tiger
(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
Sometimes I wonder who the f-ck I am
So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin' what am I supposed to do?
I've done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands and I took a million pictures
But I'm a hostage in my own world
And my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'ma cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do, bring this doe, and I'm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice
Cause it feel incredible, problems, I got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected
What am I doing here
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
I hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever
I don't want to come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
'Cause I've been searching for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, who gonna touch me now
And do we ever get to know the truth
Cause everyone seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rolling and I'm sipping lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinking liquor and I'm smoking weed
And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough
Wonder why I scream and stare at you
I'll be there to rescue you, problems you got several
Thank God that none of that medical
Ugh, I've been blessed with much to be expected
What am I doing here
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here
(Verse 3: Lil Wayne)
Sittin' in my Bentley, thinkin' bout these hoes
All I do is kill them, I kill them like Nicole
Simpson, flag crimson, smoke them like Winstons
I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant
I'm lightin' up a stogie, It's longer than a hoagie
Situation's gettin' fishy and I don't eat anchovies
F-ck the world, Kill them all, she answer when I call
If the cops pull us over, she gon' hide it in her drawers
See I come from a place where stars never shine
And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined
Everybody gotta die, but I ain't everybody
If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard
I'm a pimp, I ain't lyin', but that is not important
I'm just tryna to buy time, but can't really afford it
Saying ain't that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad
I feel like money in the trash like
What am I doing here
I wonder what am I doing here
What am I doing here
What am I doing here"

I heard they got nice cars up in heaven
Free liquor out the bar and the brightest fucking stars up in heaven
Heard that you can chill, not worry about the police
Not worry about someone fighting cause everything is in peace
Heard the streets paved with gold, and the women all gorgeous
You just float, can't even feel where the floor is
I heard heaven got a brand new venue
Next to that restaurant, you love their menu
And everything free, so everyone cool
Look out any window, it's an incredible view
Everyone you speak to always telling you the truth
And it's only good shit when you gettin' all your news
I Imagine that, just a place that we can kick it
And be happy at, satisfaction or maybe I'm dreamin'
I'll tell you what it's like when I see it
Did you hear what heaven's like? Can you tell me
Please, I'm really trying to know
'Cause I do what I do when it's all said and done
Shit I'm just tryin' to go
If you hear what heaven's like, could you tell me
Please, I'm really tryin' to know
'Cause I do what I do when it's all said and done
Shit I'm just trying to go
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
I heard ain't nobody famous up in heaven, everybody the same
Just kick it up there in heaven 'cause nobody going to change
Nobody can complain, the parties are all insane
The people all know your name, shit you entertain
See everybody you want, always keep in touch and
Go and chill by yourself when everything get too much
Never a fucking rush, so therefore a million plus
You prolly got a mercedes but always could take the bus
So fuck, that's what heaven's like
I guess think it is
Come to think of it I've been drinkin' shit
I don't know the truth
It's what I imagine when I was standin on the booth"

Prayin' I don't waste it gettin' faded
'Cause I'm smoking, till I'm coughin' up tar
Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don't act hard, still read Babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of Google map stars, shit
They got a app for... that
But me, I'm still trapped inside my head I kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm living paradise, what would I have to worry 'bout?
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
The difference between love and war inform me I'm above the norm
But, give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhymin like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label think I'm black balled
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm running from, but I'm running still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothing real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fucking deal
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the route of evil
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you ain't talkin' bout some money I'ma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional,
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity I let them go
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow
That's just me all wylin' out and being extra though
And, if God was a human it'd be yours truly
Watching horror movies with some foreign groupies, thinking this decor suits me
I do drugs to get more loopy, I'm in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful
Looking out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet
I think I'm JFK's final speech
They try assassinating all of my beliefs
But I'm asleep so whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now it's just not the same
I'm looking out the window ashing on my pane
Shit, I wonder if I lost my way
Don't you ever wanna hide away
Side and triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face
Shit, that God fell on me, reside in space
As, time's a wasting I'm freebasing with freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin'
Dreamin' of places my own personal creations
If death's a party in heaven, I plan to leave wasted
Retracin' my steps way back to biblical times
We-we all gon' end up meetin' at the finishin' line"
139,Thoughts From A Balcony,2012,Macadelic (2012),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"(Verse 1: Mac Miller)
Uh, lemme get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryna to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me
Well, I made it big and, everybody phony
Haha, so could you pour me, I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mixin' purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much
Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Looking at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
So what the fuck is time?
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (x2)
(Verse 2: Mac Miller)
What do you do when you think you could be an icon?
Because all these people get to screamin' with the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racin' to the gate but my flight gone
Now these writers taking shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be all right though
Potion in my sprite, then my night slows, down, down
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was ""Donald Trump"", a fucking hit but I call it love
They throw it on when I'm walking in the club
Hey, this the Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you lookin' for me on the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill your cup up, and I'mma sip mine
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Looking at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
So what the fuck is time?
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (x2)"
140,Time Flies,2015,GO:OD AM (2015),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"(Lil B:)
Time flies, time flies. As we keep living and as we keep being positive, all we can do is hold onto these memories.
Mac Miller, I love you
All of my homies used to get on my case like ""when you gonna kill 'em?""
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprouts some children
But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these Nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man, my mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches can still can fuck my hologram, god... damn...
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies, time flies
Try to catch it
(Lil B:)
Watch as time go, time moves, time flows. How do we handle these things?
I am time, we are time and we have control. One thing we need to remember is that we are all in this together
You can expect the unexpected
These dreams are manifested from my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive, but...
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless, with an ego big as Texas, thinkin' ""I'm the man""
I never let these hoes into the plan
My room for bullshit in the clear as small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road
Even thought I know they need my at home
Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold
East to that own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies, time flies
Try to catch it
(Lil B:)
One day we will, we will find, we will concur, concur with love, while time is one our side.
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories. They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on, Lil B"

The drinks stay cold where we coolin'
Being broke starts to get a little old
My money had to get some fine tunin'
Tonight might be the night I make it
So let's live it up and don't regret it at all
All these faces, different places
People hit me up but I'm forgettin to call
Get away to California when the weather get's colder
My honey's by the pool and I'm sippin on mimosas
Chillin' at the beach house loungin' on the sofa
Try to find a cheuffer on my way to blow up,
Stoner, roll up, fishin, champange wishin'
Five star chefs they cookin' in the kitchen
But makin' only the good shit,
See the way I livin' they like oh my goodness
I tell 'em I'm fine,
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind
And baby all we got is time
Let's just watch the clouds go by
In the rain I need to Panic
Girl, we can lay upon this hammack
No need to pose, everything here is candid
Livin' in the moment, feelin' so splendid
Bottles on me you can put it on the Debit
I'm just tryin' to have fun tonight, so everybody wang chung tonight
Girl. you could fall in love tonight
Cause trust me I'ma fuck you right
Got My louise shades on
Ain't a damn thang wrong
Fillin up cup till the bottle all gone
We just Coolin', coolin, feel the breeze
Had to give you something
You could sing of key like "" la lala lala lala""

Got a lot of things I got to do

In my life time, my whole M.O. was to get this M.O.N.E.Y
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang
I done seen some spooky things through these gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade
But can't we all just get along?
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say ""Soulo, you so crazy and deranged""
I say I know, roll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!)
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash
Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo) Our Anarchy is our NR key
Your confidence is caca compared to a kamikaze

In this life time, be the time of your life
It's been a while, but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike
And as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest
Curse words we're probably my first words, affirmative
My home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest mind will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to write my wrongs, the day's short, the night's is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish
From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer
Walk on water, it won't be long till I flyin', that's my departure
I'm a goner, shootin' down from the sky with the eyes of an archer
What a fine act you got for, I don't know why what I get so high for
I'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time...
When I was just a kid

I bet it must be nice chilling every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm working all the time, never getting me a break
Fuck it, that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just wanna be a legend, every second I got to be going in
A part of me want to chill, but a part of me want to win
No college paying my bills, I'm saying just what it feels
Cause haters be looking stupid when you just keepin' it real
I got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit
When the people coming up sayin' I'm forgetting who I am just because they
Random dudes I went to school with
I'm cool with chillin' with some buddha smoke
I always do it big like a Jewish nose
Cadillacs I'm trynna get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything will be okay
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
Do you believe in fairytales, dreams come true?
One day you gonna make it
If they gave you hand out, and you were down, babe, would you take it?
I found out being famous in reality, well it ain't shit
Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing till you change it
Listen, baby, I'mma be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'mma make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older
And turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for free
Hey man, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?
Bitch suck my dick
How did you know I was feeling
So under the weather this evening
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
They say they love you, but they get it
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, come rest your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be all right
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be all right
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
The hate ain't gonna last forever, so I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather shit'll get better
Under the weather shit'll get better
Don't let anybody say you can't, heart beatin' like the 808
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi from round by
I know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be all right
But everything will be all right!
We go front, back, side to side

Everything in sight, homie we ain't tryna save shit

Sexy bartenders always get a really mean tip
Life's so good, please enjoy it!
End of every night when your head's in the toilet

Kill the whole bottle we'll be spinnin' like a coin flip

Screw the law, we just some motherfuckin' kids
Never listen to nobody who was tryin' to tell me ""no""
'Cause I got no problem being way outta control
Got these ladies go crazy at every single show
But you ain't drunk enough until you takin' off your clothes
Not me, you can do you
Do some crazy shit that's poppin' up on Youtube
Finna rock out, I ain't talkin' U2
Passing out, waking up without shoes
Live life on the edge, sharper than a razor
Like my liquor straight, I don't ever need no chaser
Have a good time, ain't no reason we should fight

Take your vitamins
Well I was on my way to meet up with this woman that I met the other day
While I was on my break, smokin' cigarettes
I had a rough, she had some weed and told me ""come dude, we should smoke""
Bring you parallels or bring the money, baby I am broke
So I'm walkin' up the stairs to the porch
Knocked against the door, heard some feet against the floor
The door had opened up and it was her
She told me hurry, come right in
Leave your shoes up by the furnace we just put new carpets in
She asked me 'bout my day and sat me down told me we should have some fun
There ain't nobody around
She got this crazy pill the other day when she was on her way to work
Told me it will make my problems go away and fix the hurt
That I had, well, that don't sound bad, down the hatch
Kinda nervous, just relax, she's there rubbing on my back
Well I ain't really into drugs but fuck it
I'm a take a trip and I'm a love it [love it]
I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back
Well I left right after that and started driving to my house where I reside
I was high and possibly a little fuckin' mem remur
Can't remember where I live, it ain't like I just bought this house
I said fuck it, took a breath, opened my door and just jumped out
And it's funny 'cause I didn't hit against the road
I just went right through the ground and started floatin' on my own
I see colors, different colors, like they glowin' in the light
(From: LyricsMansion.com - vitamins by Mac Miller)
They was glowin' like they glowin' in the dark but it was bright
That's all right, this shit crazy, what the fuck she had me take
If this kill me I'm a come back, haunt her every single day
As I wait, sittin' somewhere that I've never seen
Feel like I'm forever dream, just imagine said a scene
Power in imagination, got all my surroundings changing
Found a place to drown my brain to something like it's outer space
But nothing like the pictures of the astronauts they show me back at school
When they told me drugs were bad, oh man, oh man they had me fooled
I don't know what happened to me
But as soon as it hit me, I was fuckin' free
It took me to somewhere off the map
And I don't think I'll ever find my way back"

Hey, they say it's so funny your nobody with mo' money, and the hoes love me
And these other kids don't touch me
Full contact rap no rugby
Pretty boy flow while your girl so ugly
My b-tches don't want anybody but me
They puff trees, sip liquor and suck dick
Got a lot of people worried about the things I say
And a lot of different haters they bring my way
I let me grill though they can watch the money pile
While these groupie hoes try to hunt me down
Now everyday feelin' like the best day ever
Heard it's a long road but it get way better
A lil' money in my pocket but my eyes on a million
Got these doubters listenin' surprised when they feel him
Ballin' like Jordan you ballin' like wilson
Feelin' like a kid again chillin' watchin' Gilligan

Hey, hear the alarm time to start the day, rub my eyes, light some weed
Send my mind on its way, I'm gone
Somewhere in my own dimension
I show these hoes no affection,
Just party every night gettin' so demented
At that time I'm lookin' in the mirror seeing to reflection
Got me wondering why don't they get it
Spend the night with me, I'm sure you won't regret it
Got some liquor on the way
The weed is twistin' you should stay
You still listen when they say the kid is spittin'
Gettin' paid but my differences in age got me shittin' with a rage
'Cause it was written on a page straight sicker than some AIDS
I came to get f-cked up
I came to act well
You came to prepare for the future
I live for right now
I don't think they want to, interrupt my party
Please don't interrupt my party
We just tryna find somebody for the night

Smoke some weed, get head while I do it

Planting the seeds
Working and watching it grow

Baby you could wear my hat, 
If you got somethin' to match, 
Baby you could wear my hat, just twist it to the back, 
We drinkin' out the bottle while you sittin' on my lap, 
Then we could go outside, let me take you for a ride
With the top down show you off to people you my prize, 
Nothin' like a girl who likes to wear a pair of Nikes, 
Shinin' like my high beams cooler than some ice tea, 
Yeah I got a female, who like to send some pictures to my email, 
Professional with shop and you would think she worked at retail, 
Snapbacks make 'em look so cute, and that girl know how to blow
Somethin' like she played the flute, 
That long hair and it's fallin' down her back, 
I put on my hat and she reach and try to snatch it, 
Baby you be hotter than a match stick, bad bitch, 
Make a snapback look fantastic but sorry you can't have this, 
She smiled big, kissin' on my cheek, 
Baby you could wear my hat make sure you give it back to me
Baby you could wear my hat, 
Just make sure you give it back, 
Baby you could wear my hat, 
If you got somethin' to match, 
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat, 
Just make sure you give it back, Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat, 
If you got somethin' to match, If you got somethin' to match that
She like to play her stupid games with me, 
She never seem to have enough, 
She brought some friends for whoever came with me, 
So, my homies sayin' that's what's up, 
And I hear her name's pretty from different continent
Tellin' me she's single but to tell the truth I'm not convinced, 
It's all good I'm used to boyfriends always talkin' shit, 
Thinkin' that they players but I'm coach call me Popovich, 
Baby I ain't doctor rich, but I'll probably show you a good night, 
When girls come out with me they make sure that they look right, 
She used to be so grounded, all of a sudden she took flight, 
And we ain't seen her since so tell me what does that look like, 
I'm the type to bring you right back down to earth, 
And for what it's worth I'll put that Louis on your purse, 
She like to wear my hat make me laugh so I'm guessin' she a keeper, 
I think she stole it though I keep tryin' to reach her
Baby you could wear my hat, 
Just make sure you give it back, 
Baby you could wear my hat, 
If you got somethin' to match, 
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat, 
Just make sure you give it back, Just make sure you give it back
Baby you could wear my hat, Baby you could wear my hat, 
If you got somethin' to match, If you got somethin' to match that
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat, 
But now she think she got it like that, 
I used to tell her keep her hands up off my hat, 
Damn, I think she think she got it like that"
150,Weekend,2015,GO:OD AM (2015),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets
Roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins
I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems
Fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious
They nothin' to me though I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights
Talk too much, the wrong advice
All the lights, and call my life
Doctor, doctor, will you help me
Keep me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now
Fuck this rap shit, bitch I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, my new bitch jealous now
Smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now
All the pain that they causin' like fuck it we ballin' now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling, I'm chilling, just living, I'm living away
Conversations we having, I'm getting too static, too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break
But I be good by the weekend
I be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight
We going out tonight, yeah we going out tonight
I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I'm just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
She ain't god as I, make water wine, pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the Ts and dot the Is
Wondering well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, god damn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browsers like how did I make it
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is
But I be good by the weekend
I be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend
Mondays I think of you
But I ain't tripping on it
Tuesdays I'm in
Gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit with you
You know you're staying over
Thursdays I'm sick of you
I got to get rid of you
Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of my life, alright
When I get faded you hate it but, baby, it's gonna be alright, ha, alright"
151,What Up Cousin,2009,The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown (2009),Hip Hop,Mac Miller,"What up cousin, how are you feelin'?,
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin',
Just makin' music, I hope you feel it,
But now I got a couple things that I gota deal with,
So what up cousin...
How you been, homie?
What it is, homie?
Without you here, your family feel lonly
But it's all good cousin, we gone carry on
Although it seems so unfair you're gone
People nowadays neva focus on the positives
Cause life now's only good when the guap is big
They talkin' shit, hatin' for no reason,
Haters is stupid... baby my flow, leave'em
So confused 'cause they all up bout this dumb shit
Lisa said she love it and the other shit is rubish
So ima make my time here worth it, real god for you
Lookin' back like there's nothin' I couldn't do
And there's nothin' that I wouldn't do to bring you back
Poetry, heart an soul singin' rap, I've been thinkin' that i
Found my passion rappin' 'bout the future in an old school fashion
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?,
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin',
Just makin' music, I hope you feel it,
But now I got a couple things that I gota deal with,
So what up cousin...
They say my style ain't different, I'm just like ery body else
They say my pitches gota change up, but all those people is
Just hatin' 'cause they don't know how to love theyself
Mad when someone bring my name up
An its unfortunate 'cause I'm just here comin' from the heart
Shit, I'm just tryna find somethin' for the market
An I ain't sayin' that I'm from the worst hardships, but
My life ain't no walk in the park, it's been a shark pit,
Dark with no harvest, drivin' in a car but can't find a place to park it
I got some people that I really need to talk with,
That musta been what got this shit started
There's been some people that I havn't said goodbye to
But my life gota go on, an it don't mean that we forget
Because we dedicate our lives to, that's why I wrote this fuckin' song
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?,
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin',
Just makin' music, I hope you feel it,
But now I got a couple things that I gota deal with,
So what up cousin...
Shits real out there, ain't nobody playin' round
I got some bangers an some druggies that I hang around
Erry body does their own thing and you can find me
On the corner makin' money when its snowing,
I sell a lil weed, get my pockets fat
But I talk to cats who be movin lots of crack
It ain't the good life, it ain't the bad, its just makin' the best of what we have
I'll put the dollars down an move into the lab
That's how much I want this music shit to last,
An some days I feel its movin to fast
Schools gone pass, not rememberin a class,
Start to leave, before you know its time to grow up
Focus on the real try not to get ya hopes up
So far I've had some hard work an a lil luck
Some make it to the money, I ain't gone giveit up
What up cousin, how are you feelin'?,
I heard that you been raised high above the ceilin',
Just makin' music, I hope you feel it,
But now I got a couple things that I gota deal with,
So what up cousin..."

Buster better bring me to the safe
Want it right now I ain't really tryna wait
Got me on trial but I'm beating that case
Motherfucker say it to my face
Say it to my face, motherfucker go and say it to my face
Trippin' now, everything straight
Rappers all wanna drop it now and they can't even get a date

In the middle of the ocean, see the land here
Any helicopter, fucker, we gon' land here

Drink liquor like water, getting drunk too much, haan

How it is when you young, blowing up too much
Talking shit, but I know you ain't been up to much
Man I been working, said I'm the greatest
Now that I'm certain, Benzo the latest
Drunk and I'm swerving, I'm going ape shit on all of my verses
Fuck being famous, I'm here to fuck up your favorite
Lately I'm hearing too much of the same shit
Young and I'm faded, killing shit, bury it all under my basement

""I wanna rap""
Go right ahead
(Mac Miller - Verse 1)
Girls ask me for that Willie D
That's how I know they feeling me
It's simple see, the pimping be
What got these bitches clipped to me
You maybe at the game, I guarantee you, we in different seats
I seen you in the nosebleeds, but where I'm at, that isn't cheap
In the Benz, in a Jeep, make a million in a week
Taking off her clothes 'fore I begin to speak like gimme cheeks
Been to London, been to France, go there if you get the chance
Been to Amsterdam, hit the club, hell no I didn't dance
Rolled around a little, smoked the weed, seen the red lights
Ain't f-ck a prostitute but the head nice, get right
From here on to the next life, relax and sip that Red Stripe
The way I spend this money you would think I had an ex-wife
Bitches love the lead pipe, the 'Burgh word to Ken Rice
New place every day, what I would give to just have 10 nights
Yeah right, 'bout to drop an album, hope to blow your mind
Tryna reach a level where no music is put over mine
Girls ask me for that Willie D
Girls ask me for that Willie D
What does it mean to keep your pimp hand strong?
Live it up cause you don't live that long
Or am I wrong?
(Mac Miller - Verse 2)
It's young Macintosh, tell you bout that sabotage
Travelling through Germany, word to David Hasselhoff
Back and forth, kill 'em softly
Bitches like to f-ck 'em doggy
Probably off some Molly got me turning into polygons
On and on, DJs putting on my song
People say I talk too long
Killing every single track, the God is on
They cheering with their pom-poms, buying what I got on
Straight gold, find me f-ckin silver with my long John
Tom Tom, direct me to that money please
Where's funds? F-ckin dumb, get your grades
And I know in God we trust, but how much do they trust in me?
Enough to be a f-ckin beast on beats, yeah
Shit is so disgustingly amazing
Bitches out the playpen, you f-ck your hand asking
""How much money can I fit into this rubberband?""
Hustling, throw your ass right inside a garbage can
Excuse my French, that's just how I talk if I was Russell Brand
Know that I'm the f-cking man
Play my shit for three days
""All I make is hits, call me T-Pain!""
Sicker than if she gave me AIDS, plus some teeth decay
Then she stole my condom, try to auction it on Ebay
Talk a little shit man, probably thought he diss me
Bitch please, I just ate out Monica Lewinsky
Yeah, I've taught her about some
Had her crying about her father
Then I busted in her face while she told me it's an honor
We just politickin, finger-licking on my chicken
Got a way with words, words, words
Word to Charles Dickens
I wrote this on the shitter using toilet-paper
Put your head inside the water, enjoy the flavor
Yeah bitch, you know how I drive
Don't cut me off man! f-ck you!

To get into her view by my side, to tell you I love you
I can't do no wrong when you are an angel
With you by my side, you are my euphoria
Euphoria...
And when you look in my eyes the pain goes away, euphoria.
You feel so damn good, I want you to know that
Just come take my hand closer.
We could go to the moon
Look in my eyes as we lay, euphoria.
Euphoria...
Now when you lay in my arms the pain goes away, euphoria.
Euphoria...
And when you're mine, I won't let you go.
The pain, it can stay, like euphoria
Euphoria..."
