0,'B' Word,2007,Made (2007),,Scarface,"Let's do it!
They sayin' 'Face you need to slow down dude
You refer to hoes as bitches and that ain't cool
I tell 'em look out fool, I ain't Al Sharpton
My name Brad Jordan, I don't beg pardons
Don't get me wrong I got respect for black ladies
But black hoes and ladies, ain't the same baby
And lately, I've been checkin' out new prospects
And you can catch me in the projects
Huntin fo' that Next Top Model
Cute with a shape like a coke bottle, suck a dick and won't swallow
Yeah, yet that's degradin her still
To ladies, if you ain't fuckin' her the next nigga will
Instead of trippin' on who callin a bitch
You maybe need to focus on who fuckin' his chick
If you a weak nut, we bop, never hit a G spot
Nuttin too quick and scared to play with the clit
Pullin her hair while you callin her bitch
Shit you missin' the point, you need to ask what she want
(Want me to stick my finger in your booty) {OKAY~! }
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife
I don't give a fuck what she look like
She can have an ass like Buffy
And a face like Janet, head so good you can't stand it
But you still can't manage
To keep her off of them streets, 'cause she's skanless
Fuckin' every nigga with a bankroll
How you fall in love with a stank hoe
Now you're blowin' up her cell phone and she won't answer
Trippin' for a dude like a dancer
And that's sick like cancer
Man this bitch is trash and he's at her
Dawg you dealin' with a fucked up babe
With fucked up ways, it's fucked up but hey!
A new day, and niggaz gotta listen
And if she got some dudes that she hang with
You better watch that bitch 'cause she dangerous
A lady got a man at the house
A bitch got her best friend man in her mouth
And she don't give a fuck about a ring
The kid, the 15 years this brings
She'll fuck you in your house in the bed you're about
Leave the sheets full of drip stains, wash her pussy off
Then bounce, now you at home with a soft dick
Feelin' bad, try to shake this bitch
But you scared of the outcome, she might tell
Or get drunk, feel guilty, come by and try to sell it
To your wife like it's yo' fault, duck at all costs
And if that ain't a bitch, what's a bitch, I'm lost
A hoe will jump dick to dick to get paid
But a bitch fucks yo' shit up so just wait
Cain't nobody else prosper, she live for the gossip
Hates to see the next bitch happy so she knocks her
She hates yo' man and hates yo' friends
But a bitch is a bitch is a bitch in the end
(I know you you ain't call me no bitch)
(Talkin' about a ring and a dick in the mouth)
(You just a bitch-ass nigga)
(Fuck me not your wife bitch!)
(I don't have a beef motherfucker)"

Take time out to tell everybody that been bumping my shit for the past thirteen years, that I love that man, I appreciate that
Every motherfucking body that was in my corner, comparing me to the greats, you know in the game, I appreciate that too man
Umm...
I've got too many motherfuckers to name, so I'll just say I appreciate y'all, y'hear?
Alright

I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin'
Had to find my place
But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
Had to dodge a case
Had to dodge a bullet
And the nigga that tried to pull it
The streets is throwed
If I don't get lean and blowed everyday
I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive
All my life this drive I tried
I seen a lot of good niggas die
Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
Or somebody's a bitch
I wish I could change the past
But I gots to live in the present and pray
That tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin' to fast
Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me
But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself
I found out she had to told me
Just to show me just how good I had it
I guess I couldn't see it
Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it
But that was just the way we used to g it
One of the wrongest niggas I see
Or one of the strongest niggas I know
Walkin' on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know
So I put weed in the bong and I blow
Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
Child that grew into a man that's widely respected
Too real
I feel no pain
I can't complain
Stuck in the game
Tryin' to maintain
'Cause I'm so real
(Pimp c)
We blow big everyday
But that don't stop our pain
Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
Got niggas doin' 40
When you 25 that's life
I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
These bitch ass niggas shife
Niggas might snitch out they momma
That's why me and leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama
'Cause we ain't promised tomorrow
But nigga you promised to die
Nigga can't you see you gettin' to high trippin' of that potent fry
At night I talk to God and try to understand
How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
I guess they already gone, ain't nothin' gone bring them back
So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones
But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun
I guess that's true for some
But them hoes will never win
Out here just hustlin and grindin
Tryin' to change from niggas to men
(3-2)
My nigga you a ho to me
Boy you done went off on me
Runnin' round with the fakin and hatin'
I'ma blast if you run up on me
I'ma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch
This matter coulda been resolved
If you woulda came clean and paid my shit
See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last
Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass
And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up
No respect for your family that's dead
Don't write yo peoples locked up
Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game
Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name
You boys is funny
I'm bout my money
And oh so true
Mr. 3-2 when I never trusted you
I'm too real"
4,A Minute To Pray And A Second To Die,1991,Mr. Scarface Is Back (1991),,Scarface,"(Scarface)
Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why...
His life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
Till a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but hey
I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldn't raise
And she will never see her father again, 'cause he's in a grave
I always think about ??
""My daddy was a dopeman, so I'ma be a dope dealer""
How will the family explain it?
""My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!""
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid livin' fly fucks me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizin life is hard
A big time dope dealer's all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situation's got me guessin...
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die
...
(Scarface)
It was crazy how it happened
Some niggaz rolled by in the Riviera cappin
All I could see was a pistol spittin' rounds
And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled - get an ambulance
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You shoulda seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head
He just laid there in silence...
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up...
Followed by a law man and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher...
But if he survives, I'm willin' to betcha
He'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by ?? on Scott Street
School was lettin out,
""Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?"" ""WATCH ME!""
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun...
... He shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin' at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullard
His brother was just dazed in a shock, ""Why you do it?""
""Why you shot his moms Jay? Shit""
""Hehehehehe... hah man fuck that bitch""
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack, ""Aiyyo J.D. homey""
Hung it up and rolled down Dagger
Headin for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven niggaz all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper
Shit gets deeper but why?
I guess you only get a minute to pray,
And a second to die"

Sunday morning I'm off at church
Sinnin' throughout the week, hustlin' every day
Gettin' it as we speak, listen to preacher preach
Choir singing the song, annie clapping her hands
Momma singing along, I'm impatient I wanna leave
Can't let my Momma see, I ain't listening to the word
Not like I don't believe, but I'm trippin' nobody perfect
To speak it wouldn't worth it for a person to be so Christ like
But I swear, I heard him cursin'
Let him without no sins cast the first stone
But I am so not him so let me go on on
Get home and he will find his hat on
Who's family when this all went on
Come on, let's see, some laughs, then we
Can do the same damn thing again next week
I love it when It happens like that
I smile 'cause it's not all bad
(G.I.)
You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it ain't all bad
(Scarface)
Monday mornin' it's back to business
Cash the motivation, cops steady watchin'
Plottin' and waiting patient
Yeah I been thinkin' lately
Prayin' on even maybe
Probably best if I left it
The stress will drive you crazy if you let it
The penitentiary is where were headed
Designed for downfalls and some still don't get it
And yeah I might have said it way back and got sweated by
The same ones that hittin' it now but no credit came to me
If you can see the things I see
Then you could point your fingers at the blame not me
Ashamed how we can't stand one another
We hate the idea of a unified young brother so we suffer
But I adapt 'cause I'm a hustler
I still stay strapped with the muffler
I'm ten toes trapped in the struggle cause
I'm what the hood made motherfucker what
(G.I.)
You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it ain't all bad
(Scarface)
As solid these niggas come, realist they ever made
Money is not important it's livin' it how you say
Picture back in the day, me moving a brick a week
Murdered you if I had to nigga I'm from the streets
And out here were playing for keeps, speak and your getting froze
Neck gettin' wrapped in sheets, sneakers will be exposed
This bullet here for your soul
Bitches is just for sex, that said I could jack my dick
She don't deserve respect, I'm knowin' my niggas feel it
Nothin' is fabricated authentic as I can say it
The only way I play it, this is for Curtis Davis
Mothers of fallen soldiers, Children of murdered fathers
Fathers out on the corners
Corners I'm standing on and I love 'em without a reason
Feelin' they aid the bleedin' they made me I'm never leavin'
Though the looks can look deceiving
Believe me y'all it might sound sad
But trust me dog it's not all bad
(G.I.)
You know they say that no one's perfect
That's why we struggle every day
Just know that every single day is a blessing
I'm just tryna find my way
I keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
Tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head above water
Cause it ain't all bad"

I got a headache this big...
Word up... word up... word up...
It's kinda hot in here
Haha (word up) Brick City (word up)
Funk Doc (word up) Scarface, yo yo
It can't be!
P-P-P, knuckleheads on parole without a GED
BBC, abroad, goldenrods out the fo'
(Bla bla...) I strip ya down to ya optimo, cigars
I pull cards like Vegas
Clap my hands then walk away from the table with ya payment
(How I'm paid?) Niggaz are barely a village
I spit with a foul mouth like Terrance and Phillip
A man or gorilla (ah ah) my cap toot back like Fred
So white bitches jump on my +Limp Bizkit+ and yell
""You niggaz know you can't fuck around""
Haha yeah, you see me, you be duckin up and down
(Yo yo yo) Super Lex, cop a thing-thing
Guzzle it down with two bottle of Ginseng
Fuck ya brains out hold when Al Green sings
When your out cold, bitch steal ya bling bling
You died for ya mom and pop, don't sweat it
I got the next bitch rockin' ya birthday present
News at 11, Scarface and Doc
From Bricks to South Park we say, ""FUCK THE COPS!""
(Hook: Redman)
Yo, you niggaz know you can't fuck around
You niggaz know you can't fuck around
You see me, you be yuckin duckin up and down
What, these niggaz know they can't fuck around
What, you niggaz know you can't fuck around
You see me in the streets, you be duckin up and down
Nigga, you niggaz know you can't fuck around
Yo, you niggaz know you can't fuck around
(Scarface)
As I, bring it to ya one more time
From a state where we stole weight, and dough mind dine
And we don't tote six-shooters, we tote glock nines
And we don't smoke a peace pipe, we smoke fat dimes
It's a place where it's a common site to see the 5-0
Hit the other side of sixteen and getcha mind blown
Fo sho', it's a different vibe from being downtown
Then when ya come into the ghetto and ya can't come back out
I seen the ghetto shut down, seen niggaz shot up
Seen niggaz get knocked the fuck out and never got up
The neighborhood paralyzed, crack drive-bys
It's evident we hurt, you ignored our cry
On the outside the ghetto just another mindstate
And import more minorities to help the crime rate
I ain't lookin' for a job, fuck workin the part-time
When we could come up on some dough, with good combs and slang dimes
I see this all the Goddamn time - it's fucked up and it's the truth
Nevermind the shooter on the roof
It's a war goin' on right here, where we at
I can't complain about what I can't change, so why dap?
Dropped outta high school in tenth grade so I rapped
But still, can't seem to get this monkey off my back
Fuck it, I pulled a few moves and ride for the streets
And when I start to feel like this, don't fuck with me!
(Young Noble)
Yo, Young Noble Outlaw, spittin' shit with 'Face and Red
Bear looped out flows and you can taste the wet
Place ya bet, young nigga ace the test
You say Nob' got a old soul, blame the vets
Flurp shit from the earth bitch, cradle to grave
Burnt shit from the fingertips, able to spray
Nigga ya mind playin' tricks on you
Ya drew down, but ya nine won't spit for you
And ain't nobody got no hostle clips for you
You in the mix but ain't nobody doin' shit for you
It's gon' be Hell for hustler, while your neck spoil you
With the same clip you had last week
And niggaz know I know the real, that's why the fag don't speak
And I ain't even peak yet, without the heat yet
Holla my street yet, 'cause I be the beef yet
I'm hittin these niggaz hard, I ain't even eat yet
Or felt defeat yet, I melt the weak yet
Lyrical breathe death - we thugs nigga what
We take slugs to the gut
Patch 'em up, hit the Bricks, it's time for our lunch
Outlawz, Dirty Mob motherfucker!"
7,Anything,2015,Deeply Rooted (2015),,Scarface,"For a dolla' bill people will do anything
They'd rob and steal for a dolla' bill, any will
Let's go sit back and let the beat ride a lil' bit
Let a m.f hear what is supposed to sound like ya' dig
Yeah I'm from around the way, I slung about a oz a day
I'm living proof you ain't got no excuse
If it was there, it ain't got shit to lose
Dem' older cats would chunk a nigga fronts
Would rock it up and smoke that ish in blunts
For tennis shoes, we was getting' fools
We caught you slippin', we would get at you
With no respect, fu... a nigga set
We shot it up and murk his connects
What yours is mine for a dolla sign
I blame the grind, I was outta line
I'm reminiscing on what niggas did
For big rewards, you took a bigger risk
They say what comes around and go around
And when you least expect the ish be goin' down
Gotta' get it how I live, that's how the streets raised me
And for that paper most niggas do, anything, anything
A silent dude, so that's how a move I'm a street made nig
Not trying to lose, so I gotta do anything, anything
They called it murder in the first degree
And it was then that it occurred to me
This was some inside ish
That was your friend got hit huh
They knew all about the stash spot
Knew where the money was and cashed out
You got the nerve to act like you don't know
When all the while you steady gettin' mo'
Just remember dude we watchin' you
I spared your life they day they shot at you
'Cause if I didn't, they was coming back to finish off yo a
You a walkin' dead and it's a fact
You slimey niggas play the game wrong
Get popped, can't do they time so they sang songs
I turned the game on Watch the Nicks play
I sent them shottas at you're a 'cause u a b made nigga
Gotta' get it how I live, that's how the streets raised me
And for that paper most niggas do, anything, anything
A silent dude, so that's how a move I'm a street made nig
Not trying to lose, so I gotta do anything, anything
Real nigga in your presence
Money couldn't change me past or the present
Homey I'm the essence Tote a smith and western
Eyes hella tiny in the hood is where you find me
Out here with the grimey b wanna come up
Niggaa slangin'Snow packs, nose running from 'em
Let you get your mind right, money on that weed though
Baby on them molly whops blinded by the weed smoke
We come from them streets ho, I stay on that ignant' ish
Ain't nothing 'bout week ho
Always game to stomp a bi and stomp a bi...
And stomp a bi got super boxing' game
So I prefer to punch a bitch mission accomplished
Put me up against whatever I am busting it
A nucca's born hustlin' and tustlin and struggling and musclin'
Just making you aware who you fucking with"

When I was 21 I had a yellow ferrari
22 I was portioned with a top at back
23 in a rose with the pipe to match
24 I wasn't tripping what I came up in
I was focussing on how to be like james back then
Wonder how respected was the life I chose
Being famous wasn't nothing I just liked my dough
I was living in the fast lane
Man for sho
Short temper quick to up let this thing unload
So if I had a problem with ya
Use a blanket no
Shaw the message then you see the nigga's brain exploads

Hey I ain't worried about these niggas till they shooting at me

How the game go? Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistols into yard fish
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistols into yard fish
Yeah!
(Scarface)
I came here to exercise my game
Spread love to the hood is how I do my thang
Smoking weed with my homies, barbeque them wangs
Sip Hennesey and coke 'cause I don't fuck with drank
Don't pop pills either cause that shit ain't cool
We just drunk a mad Dom 'fore we went to school
Flick off, back then I was smashing boys
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now, I demand respect
And if I slapped one hoe, then her man was next
I'm a kick door robber, a hot-shot driver
A crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
If you dare to be laid, then off in the Lincoln
But if it ain't no way, then believe I'm finna take it
Cause a nigga with no hustle, it ain't worth this G
And a bitch like this is even worse than that
I've been good at bullshitting but this game can cost
And if a nigga can't maintain, mayne he lost
He a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail I heard
And as a nigga, I come in here with my balls and my word"

It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day.
It's your worst day, run and tell somebody
It's your worst day.
What it is?, nigga!
You don't wanna get involved with this here, nigga!
Is you a bitch nigga?, you a bitch nigga!
Look at yourself and then analyze me!
This motherfucking G
It's the flossy, you got girl draws and
Girl flaws and, a braud nigga!
I peeped your whole hand when you came in
I'm a man and I hang men
Play the game to win
All mission play on ten
Scarface 'finna do it again
Mash you nigga, stash them niggas
Don't make me upstrap and blast you niggas
Once again, it's a only if you must I do it
Lock you in my scope and blast your ass through it
I'ma poet
The image and the style that you used to
'Cause you don't keep it real like you used to
A O.G., S.A., fool to the hole fa'sho
So niggas slow your motherfucking roll
'Fore I come through with the same M-11
The Feds took from me, and shoot you in yo motherfucking stomach
(Chorus: Scarface)
You a Snitch Nigga, when you rat on yo friends
Bitch Nigga, when you still be in pads with yo kin
You'z a Snitch Nigga, running when the drama go's down
You was ballin' at first what happened to the man in the south
You a Snitch Nigga, specializin' at bumpin' ya gums
Bitch Nigga, countin' on ya bricks but all I see is crumbs
Snitch Nigga, ain't you tired of running your mouth
And you can go home, 'fore the Devil run in your house
(Verse: Z-Ro)
Now snitch fellas get up under my skin
That's why I don't mess with friends
Unless it's my Mac-10
I'm the king of the ghetto, Z-Ro the crooked in the flesh
Looking for head shots, 'cause bitch fellas get the bullet-proof vests
What you scared for?
What happened to all the tough ass talk
The way you was bumpin', I thought you had a taste for asphalt
Look at momma's baby out here starvin' for his ass
Whippin', chiefin', with a magician then drippin' out his ass, listen
I'll be damned if I pull a rabbit out a hat
Well pull my 40 out of holster, and do this snitch fella on his back
Whoa!, look how I handled this .44
My conscience be screaming Z-Ro Murder Mo!, Murder Mo!
And these snitch fellas on 'How I'm Living' try snitchin' on 'BET'
But got a restraining order against 'Murder I-N-C'
This how we ride, and ain't never gon' make a switch dude
Z-Ro the Crooked, I'll be damned if I be a snitch fool
(Verse 3: Bun B)
It's Bun B I go back-a like 'Atlanta Black Crackers'
I back-slap a, back-packer, from here to Cakalacka{Carolina's}
Wack cracka, short stopper or dope beginner
Bitch I ain't ya chicken hitter, bring the heater get you wetter (get you
Wetter)
We can flip the caliber magnum hanger
Step a bear off in his chest, you better hope I don't land one
If I cock the bitch back... aim it at your chest
It'll be piece before they even find the pieces to your vest
We relievers of ya stress... ease ya fame
Put this pistol in your mouth, you better lead them treason games
Now when ya momma warned ya about
Bun and he's insane
Kill a kid over a quarter, who just keeps plain
Now watch this kids plain, 'fore you fuckin' with the triller
Z-Ro the young guerilla
And Face the born killa

12,Boo Boo'n,1998,My Homies (1998),,Scarface,"(Feat. Devin)
Walk up in the session wit my dick in my hand
Fat sweet in my mouth, 24 ounce can
Ain't got no time for all yesterday he say she say
Pull out the B-Tape give it to the DJ
My eyes are tight and shinin 'cause I'm smokin' some kill
Don't look at me go buy some drinks call up some hoes if you will
I see its nothin' but a party oh well I guess that I'm the host
Ain't nobody got no more weed its time to smoke
Keep that B rollin', you see everybody's holdin' they own
You know I got to bust at least 2 or 3 before I'm gone
But there's always 1 in the crowd rappin' loud
All in the niggaz mouth for all them bitches and cowards
With the East coast flow West coast body language
Don't know nothin' 'bout the South tryin' to find someone to hang wit
Man when you finish flowin, or whatever the fuck you doin'
Holla at me I'll be in the bathroom boo boo'n
Had to get away needed some time to chill
So I bought a 59 and got behind the wheel
Scooped up a fat sack of kill I'll be drivin' a while
Takin' 2 or 3 pulls every 5 or 6 miles
I can't wait to see my road dogs you know how we do it
Just like a case of beer piece of cotton through one right through it
And all the bitches know me I hit quite a few they be glad to see me Niggaz don't give 'em dick like I do
I bust about 2 then they tell they friends then I'm in
With my French tickler makin' they pussy lips lips grin
And there's always one in the crowd
Talkin' loud found out I fucked her cousin
Now she runnin' her mouth leavin' notes on my windshield
I'm a bitch I'm a hoe
Early in the mornin bitches knockin' at my mamas door
Mama please when you finish whatever that you doin'
Who ever that is tell I'm in the bathroom boo boo'n
I got a visit from an old friend fresh out the county
He said he came up on a lick and he was glad that he found me
He had some new niggas wit him full of drink and lookin' sweaty
Cockin gats back talkin' bout, ""Come on D man you ready?""
It's a house down the street about two doors down
They sell weed and they least got 2 whole pounds
Man all we gots to do is hit this ride and we cool
Let's fuck his wife and take his weed and bust on that fool
We can all come up what ever we get we split
Ain't nobody sayin' nothin' ain't nobody seen shit
So let's pile up five deep in your 'llac
He'll know that it's you, D, and he won't think it's a jack
Man you must be smokin' crack you don't know who dat is
That nigga work for HBD been sellin weed round here for years
So whenever you finish plottin, schemin whatever you doin'
Wait for me I'll be in the bathroom boo boo'n"
13,Born Killer,1991,Mr. Scarface Is Back (1991),,Scarface,"I'ma born killer, you're face to face with Scarface
You tried to ice an X, but that's a motherfuckin waste
Your schools fucked up G
And your momma shoulda warned ya about a nigga like me
'Cause I don't weep and I don't sleep
Save that motherfucker black, cause talk is cheap
And uh, since you got beef
Lets take it to the streets and I'mma bring it to your ass G
I'm commin from the heart son
And I don't take no shit, but I'm about to start some
Now which one a you hoes wanna jump
If you got static, then get it off your chest punk
'Cause I ain't bar none
If you're feelin' lucky then go ahead and get cha some
I ain't with this fucked shit
If ya ain't in trick, then get your ass in ya trunk bitch
'Cause I'm about to square it off
Hit ya ass in the chest with the tech and try to tear it off
Send you back to mommy, it's a plastic
And hadda bitch out huntin for a casket
I'm on the for realla tilla my nilla
I'm a born killa
I'ma born killa
Born
Killa
""Don't fuck with me""
My momma did her part
But it ain't her fault that I was born without a heart
In other words I'm heartless dude
I don't love me, how the fuck I'mma love you?
That's right, you guessed it
I'm legally insane, marked mannick depressive
I'm takin' all types a medication
To keep me out the mood of premeditatin
Yo, the log around my lone is worse
I'm havin' thoughts of killin' me, but I'm killin' you first
Mr. Kindness talks but I don't listen
A victim of society fucked by the system
My whole life's been a see saw
I'm up one day, down and out on tomorrow
Right now I'm even more upset
Some shit that happened to me that I don't think I'll ever forget
You think I'll let it die, but I ain't
It ain't because I want to, its because I can't
I'mma getcha but I ain't goin' into it
Cause ain't nothin' to it but to do it
See it ain't no sweat to me
Cause in the fo place, you fucked up the minute that you stepped to me
I'm not your average dealer
I'mma born killa
Now I'm livin' where I can 'cause I'm homeless
Can't make point calls 'cause I'm phoneless
I ain't, I'm starvin duke
I can't go to mommas house cause mommas starvin too
Better grab that 12 gauge
Cause that's the only way a niggaz gonna get paid
I'm on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they don't think that I'd gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And don't think about pushin that panic switch
I'm gettin' paid and you're gettin' killed bitch
Take notes to the message I gave ya
Ya dyin' ho and can't nothin' save ya
I'm doin' bad, so I'm goin' bad
Huh, and you never expected that from Brad
But there's a lotta things pressin me
And ain't the nigga to let the mortredresser dressin me
So I'm comin' out winnin'
100,000 in the case now I'm comin' out grinnin
But the shit didn't flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pulla hoe move
He reached for his pistol
The 10 gauge went ""BOOM"" shoulda heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one a you motherfuckers in here wanna die next?
Nobody made a move
And I got away smooth
And that's how it is nigga
I spared a couple a lives, but I'm still a born killa"
14,Boy Meets Girl,2007,Made (2007),,Scarface,"Yo, this kid was raised to hustle, all he ever known was truble. His mama never kept a job his daddy die in struggle. He had a sister cute as fuck that liked this older cat. That had control over the hood, but never sold a pack. The family needing money, asking him if he get fronted. He wants to learn the game, cause being broke ain't feed 'em nothing. They met and taught em, and one more thing before we finish. You don't know me I don't know you that's how we'll start and end it. From there he's off and running, taught 'em how to save his money. Never let on meet the other, don't meet paper bleed and run it. You'll learn the basic rules, don't sell this to kids or fools. And don't you try it either, honor that and all is cool. Now he a baller dude, strippin hoes are callin dude. Addicted to the boy, shootin up and snorting too.
[Chorus] Boy meets girl, and falls in love... In this world of hate and war... Girl meets boy, and falls in love. So let stay together, play together days forever babe.
Ok, a deeper subject, titty dances seen in public. Daytime she's off in school. Trying to get a degree in something. She beautiful, after all that she's been through. I heard he father used to rape the girl and beat her too. A man a wife a kid, A car dog and crib. The perfect world if you was outside, you was looking in. Some how she got the blame. Kicked her out the house in rain. Began to fall and no one ever thought she'd be the same. Her hate for men was evadent, but it was prevalant. 'Cause where she worked had dudes that always asked her, to come home with them. Ain't look for love but fell in love inside a topless club. She met a thug, that had the drug, and that was all it was.
[Chorus] Boy meets girl, and falls in love... In this world of hate and war... Girl meets boy, and falls in love. So let stay together, play together days forever babe.
This match was made in heaven, girl meets boy and stays together. A feeling never known to either, this could be forever. Addiction follows, so in love that all the leaves are hollow. Plus nothing else exhists. Speed ball and the needle swallow. A mix of different worlds, I know you thought when boy met girl. Meant this meant no regrets, but romeo let juliet. Say those words that made him think that it was cool to try. But you know you don't get high, on what you supply. And herion's next to kin ain't a bag of coke. But when her world met up with his they both was comatosed. A tragic ending, to a couple, that was oh so close. Stopped short a happiness, 'cause they combined and overdosed..."

16,Can't Get Right,2008,Emeritus (2008),,Scarface,"(Feat. Bilal)
These are the last days, settle in
Look at the turmoil our kids left the ghetto in
They bustin' metal and, ain't got remorse for the innocent
It's just another nigga in the morgue
My momma's pregnant with a son she should abort
'Cause she ain't knowin' what I'm fin' to be facin is nothin' short
Of a, racially motivated killin' cause them boys
See a nigga as only a third of a human, {? }
Every time I see a cracker with a badge, I'm in awe
'Cause I'm knowin' how he feel, and I'm just bein real
I don't hate and I don't preach it ain't no motherfuckin secret
We ain't first class citizens, and we ain't second either
Need to, get up and get out, and cut that bullshit out
Nigga get yo' own you strugglin at this bitch house
The lack of makin' money make a motherfucker bend
If you'd rather me than you die in the end, again and again
(Chorus: Bilal)
I made it over to dry land
But still wound up sinkin in quicksand
I'm tryin' Lord, I just can't get right
Paid the bills on Monday
Even went to church on Sunday
But I, but I, but I just can't get right
I lay in bed lookin' up at the ceiling
As the fan turns in a circle, thinkin' 'bout my evil
Seein end on my TV, bombs in the skies
Over Baghdad they fight but they don't know why
What they said about Hussein, was a God damn lie
Raised a war against a religion for oil, don't lie
I seen, kids from the hood livin' like they gon' die
With the mindset of be broke or let's go get high
With the people livin' so crazy how we gon' get by
Gasoline five dolars, how the fuck we gon' drive?
Can't afford to fill our prescriptions so we all gon' die
CVS is slangin dope on every block worldwide
Since, spies up and had the dope game on fine
Then it's only right for one nigga to go get mine huh
If they injured how they gon' survive?
If they stuck at the bottom how the fuck they gon' ride?
Ain't life a muh'fucker, first you think you got it, then it
All falls apart in front your eyes, try to stop it, but it's
Part of the plan that was written by the man
Got me down on my knees and my hands, prayin'
Forgive me Lord, thank the Lord I'm alive
'Cause I'm knowin' deep down I coulda died
I shed so many tears lost so many peers
In the grave or the penitentiary facin 20 years
Pourin beers on the corner, cause Frankie told me {? } lonely
I was high livin' blind to the fact that they sold us out
America the Beautiful, there's a funeral
On every day of the month, tryin' to get our knees up
Huh, it's another chance under these circumstances
My people ain't advancin, but if we pray
Maybe we'll get to live our life in the sun
'Stead of livin' on the blocks dyin' young, here I come"

In your face with this thing aimed at ya
Your facin danger, 16 with one up in the chamber
I'm bout to stain ya, with this muthafuckin handgun
And fuck dem laws, dey got my brother already
Dey can suck my balls, average nigga have no luck at all
But because I be in my 'Lac chillin'
They stereotype me, thinkin' I'm into crack sellin
Man I'm windy city 2-20, anybody chin checker
3rd floor lake grove, 35th in leather gloves
With the snub nose, complex born and raised
And under siege every day
The definition, of a gaurilla
He is a killa, robbin for scrilla
Not your average every-day nigga
The laws at me, better off dead 'cause I ain't happy
Kill or be killed, Id rather go to war before they catch me
Arrest me, I told you before I wears vest's
A born legend by the way of .357
I'm an automatic with static its tragic Mr A-l-K-a-p-o-n-e
The last man standing
Rollin', ridin', slowly slidin
Creepin' up in da corners where you hoes be hidin
Takin' you over in ways you never even thought of
The city's under siege nigga don't get caught up
I'm a 4th ave lake street ridin' ass nigga
Still a ? superior executioner
Da bomb M-i-d-w-e-s-t mirage
Da killa wit?
(A city under siege)
Ghetto birds hover over southside Chicago
Ellis park killin' fields, gang war rival
Bigger than the sears tower, I was a pain in the smoke
They found his body floatin the lake shore
8 holes filled up his body full of hot ones
Shot one, two, three, four, down like dominoes
Cop killin' columbian 'nect?
Split, grown snitch, it's over with
I said a hip-hop, pour a cup of coffee
And then I sip and stop
Because we gettin' watched by some new group
New brood MC's walkin' round like you and me
But all they do is listen shit only a fool'd believe
275, big fat and nasty, fuck bein classy
I'm straight ghetto, chuckin beer bottles out da window

Fully automatic for you hoes who wanna jack this
S.A. fool, and I'ma put you on your back, bitch
Ain't no half-steppin, I'm comin' at you rough-like
Shootin to kill cause back in school I had enough fights
Whenever when I bucked my knuckles up on a nigga's head
So you can sling 'em all you want but I be slingin leg
Cause like I said befo' I'm a muthafuckin dreadlock
Puttin' fools in headlocks, givin' niggas headshots
And everybody in your muthafuckin area
Is tryin' to scrap up some money, so they can help to bury ya
But I can give a muthafuck about your family
Because your family ain't my fuckin' family
You shoulda thought before you stepped to tha
Nigga in black standin right here next to ya
I'm stoppin' muthafuckas from breathin
Just gimme a reason and I'ma be squeezin
The trigger of this muthafuckin glock, pop-pop until you drop
>From these muthafuckin gunshots
And leave your whole fuckin' family sad
Don't fuck with the Brad, muthafucka
Cause Brad's comin' agg
Where the cocksuckers at, where the cocksuckers at?
(Where they at? Where they at?) (There they go) at my gat
'Cause I'm about to heat up like a vet
Chop shit down on your set and then jet
And smash off in my soap box
'Cause I'm down for the dirt and muthafuckas said it don't stop
Now which one of you hoes wanna fuck
Make your way to your truck
I wanna see the way that you jump
Cause by the time you get your keys
I'm lettin loose, muthafucka, lay 'em down, nigga, and get these
It ain't shit for me to watch 'em fly
So die, muthafuckas, die, muthafuckas, die, die
I ain't no muthafuckin good guy, dog
And I don't give a good guy damn about none of y'all
I'm from the state of the muthafuckin gunslingers
Knockin' dicks in the dirt with just this one finger
So get your ass caught up in this gangsta shit
And I'ma try my best to make it stank, you bitch
Plus you comin' with that fake drag
You fallin' dead on your ass, you muthafucka
I'm comin' agg"

Lyrics for Song: Conspiracy Theory
Lyrics for Album: Jerusalem
What if I told you it was done with mirrors
What if I showed you it was all a lie
Better be careful, someone might hear ya
The walls have ears and the sky has eyes
What if I said you were only dreamin'
What you wanna bet that all you gotta do
Is open up your eyes and you will wake up screamin'
When you realize that it's all come true
Hush, now don't you believe it
Cover your head and close your eyes
Now, take it or leave it
Go back to bed
Now don't you cry
Half a million soldiers fly across the water
One in ten are never comin' back again
Fifty thousand sons who never grew to fathers
Don't you ever wonder who they might have been
What if you could've been there on that day in Dallas
What if you could wrestle back the hands of time
Maybe somethin' could've been done in Memphis
We wouldn't be livin' in a dream that's died
Go on and tell yourself again there are no secrets
Go on and tell yourself that you don't want to know
It's best that you believe that you don't hear the footsteps
That follow you around no matter where you go
Maybe you were thinkin' that it didn't matter
Maybe you believed nobody else would care
But once you've added every little lie together
You finally find the truth was always waiting there

Like he knowin' what it's like to be hated and criticized
And sharks in the water create you the wrong way
When you're a target, see that's how these niggaz out here behave
I hate to go to funerals, I never visit graves
'Cause I'm knowin' that through this dirt that you can't hear me when I say
That I love you dawg, and out of all them power moves I coulda made
I focused on keepin' your family straight
I, po' out some liquor so you don't go out forgotten
I'm drownin off in this bottle, tryin' to solve my fuckin' problems
New days changes, different than how it was
We upped it from stealin cars to hustlin, dealin' drugs
I've seen a whole lot of good niggaz die
Cause the ghetto took advantage when situations provide
That's my life - story of a nigga in the ghetto
Money minimal so we settle
For whatever they give us in the ghetto
We settle
That's my life - story of a nigga in the ghetto
Crack rock slangin in the ghetto
Momma why you leave me in the ghetto
The ghetto
(Scarface)
The little kids in the hood live a life with no outlets
Rap or ball playin' to survive
Devils in disguise in the fact that a nigga's broke
Makes him more prone to drop out of school and fuck with dope
With hopes of gettin' paper and chasin his fuckin' dream
But America's got us dyin' for it waitin for relief
The penitentiaries is filled to the max
With my people who tried to make it out but never made it back
Crack, to see yo' momma doin' bad
Hit as hard as you see it, yo' daddy sittin' on his ass
Doin' nothin', fuck it, that's when them tears start rushin
White powder in the coffee pot bubblin, hustlin
I know exactly where you at dawg
Out there on the corner where the rats crawl
It's my life
(Scarface)
I shoot it out befo' I bail, fly befo' I set sail
I'd rather die 'cause I could never tell
Rather see Heaven, I done been through Hell
Seen the elderly fucked by drug laws, niggaz dyin' in jail
The guidelines stiffer, they sentence my people different
Instead of intervention they sendin us straight to prison
First time offenders get tangled up in the system
For ghost dope, he went from dopeman to straight killer
It's po' folks, you livin' in the hood but yet and still you can't survive
Cause Reagan never planned for us to rise
The war on drugs turned to a war on us
Then AIDS just topped it off, this shit here is fucked up
You either, eat or you starve, rob or go get a job
Break down to either wake up, hustle or pray to God
Faith is one thing without work you ain't got nothin'
Decisions from a motherfucker strugglin"
21,Diary Of A Madman,1991,Mr. Scarface Is Back (1991),,Scarface,"(Scarface talking)
Yo anybody seen my diary? Oh there it is.
I gotta write this shit down. Check it out.
Dear Diary, I'm having a little problem
I can't make it by myself maybe you can help me solve em
I'm confused and I don't know what to do
I'm hoping you can help me cause there's no one else to talk to
I want to die, but it ain't for me
I try to talk to my dad, but my old man ignores me
He says I'm delirious
And I drink too much, so he doesn't take me serious
But little does he know I'm really losing it
I got a head, but ain't no screws in it
I be thinking deep
That's one of the reasons at night I can't sleep
I thought it would change when I was older
But even now I'm still peeping over my shoulder
There's your life after death too
And what about the man with the cane and the black suit?
And what about cancer?
Too many motherfucking questions, and not enough answers
Ain't no use in trying
We might as all face it we were all born dying
There's a black book in Brad's hands
And it's the diary of a madman
Dear diary today I hit a nigga with a torch
Shot him on his face and watched him die on his front porch
Left his family heartbroken
Flashbacks of him laying there bleeding with his eyes open
I can't put the shit behind me
I'm know I'm here somewhere, but I can't find me
I used to be a drug dealer
On the for reala, now I'm a born killer
And it ain't no changing me
It used to be hard, but now it ain't no thing to me
To go up to a niggas house
Put a pistol in his mouth, and blow his fucking brains out
No doubt if you cross then I'ma take ya
'Cause I'm a fucking killer by nature
You got an M11, bring your weapon
Huh, I got an AK-47
It's gonna be a bloody Sunday
Cause your fucking with a nigga like Bundy
And I was taught not to kill
Like a Vietnam vet with a thousand yard stare
So welcome to the slaughterhouse nigga
Redrum and I'ma be the grave digger
And if you want to cap, come cap me
I'm trigger happy like my great-grandpappy
Just watch for the chrome in my right hand
My second entry from the diary of a madman
Dear diary, help me 'cause I'm frantic
S-sometimes I think I'm going schizophrantic
The world's looking dark for instance
Maybe 'cause I'm looking from a distance
But then again I wear a blindfold
Staring at the motherfucking world with my eyes closed
To myself I'm a stranger
Walking in the foot steps of danger
It's a long path ahead of me
I gotta get somewhere cause everybody here is scared of me
I had a job but they fired me
My wife walked out now I'm living in my diary"

Dirty, fo sho
It's your downfall
(Tanya Herron)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Scarface)
Hopeless again, and the more I stick around the shit get more fucked up
That's why I'm back on Holloway gettin' fucked up
Thinkin' back on how it used to be when it was all good
We wasn't trippin', this was our hood
I had your motherfuckin back
And when it was time to go to war, it was like ""where these niggaz at?""
Fuck rackets, we ain't never been the type to hold out
Or, let a motherfucker show out
No doubt, we put it down for the 9-0-triple 4
Droppin' tops, fuckin' fine hoes
These other niggaz is finally catching up
Listening to rappers ballin and gettin' touched
Wasup? You done forgot about the street rules, splurgin
Is you a motherfucking fool?
Money ain't a thing to a nigga out here rappin'
But to a nigga out there cappin?
That's they downfall
(Chorus: Tanya Herron)
Dir-tay, yeah
Dirty money
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Dir-tay, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dirty Money
(Scarface)
Now the whole neighborhood silent
Got the fed-e-rals hangin' (Shhhh)
While these young niggaz steady sangin
I need a motherfuckin law-uh-yer (Why's that?)
I'm in a state of paranoia
How many niggaz in the six-by-six
Fin' to get, some time behind some loud mouth bitch
Fin' to snitch, trapping niggaz up in they downfalls
Taping motherfuckers phone calls
Ay, I've been in this shit for two deep
From moving ki's, pushing weight was too sweet
An 8-ball will cost you 75 (Dirt cheap)
Back in the game that shit was live
And all you had to do to survive was get a whole click
Of niggaz, down with they business and stack chips
Savin' up for hard times
Do the time when you do the crime
You niggaz tryin' to ? your downfall
(Voice with effects)
Nothing lasts forever but love
Money comes and goes
But for those ?? it surely goes
(Scarface)
You rollin' over in the joint, trying to get your time dropped
Puttin' niggaz up forever, cause you did the crime hop
Turned fed, and know they got indictments for real
Runnin' in niggaz houses, niggaz fighting appeals
Offering 50 years to innocent motherfuckers
All because of the game, niggaz run outta hustle
Feds be showin pictures, you got to give 'em somethin'
Time make a nigga forget it and start bumping
And saying shit, jeopardizing the whole thang
Niggaz run out of freedom, niggaz start to sang (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)
Laughing in your face, chuckle and produce
Avoid they conversation, them niggaz the dudes, fool
(Outro - spoken as Chorus repeats)
Thing is, when a motherfucker is doing dirt
Don't come moving it, ya know what I mean
Ya know, that won't get you no Rolls Royces and shit like mine baby
Your money dirty, wash your shit
Them motherfuckers out here, yeah
""Dirty money"" *scratched to end*"

I am ghetto, boy, chillin'
Represent for the niggas in the hood and how they livin'
Heavy metal concealin'
Hustlin' till you touch a 9 to 5 of drug dealin'
It don't matter how I get it, I got it, fuck feelings
I don't have none, I'm 'bout my paper, nigga, ask 'em
Don't get confused on how the cash come
Never, by any means necessary better
Get up off your ass and get my money 'fore I stretch yah
Out in front your doorstep, when I brandish this .45th
You can make arrangements, you a dead man, a ghost
See I come from them cuts for real
Much long before this rap came, fuck the deal
I survived the game of life, nigga, fuck some skills
Crossin' me, get in the way, this pussy must get killed
I'm alive, he came, he bust till he left
I would have made for sure I was dead and fuck yourself
Yeah, cause now I'm at his ass with a vengeance
Blood in, blood out from the beginning to the ending
Real shit bein' spit, know your limits
It's best you mind your motherfuckin' business
If you ain't in it
(Z-Ro)
So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin', no, eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle till I see the dirt
Riskin' 25 years just to see another first
(Rick Ross)
I was all alone, car full of niggas
How'd I get here? Car full of hittas
I was rollin' weed, they was snortin' blow
Such a cool breeze, heart so cold
Step up to the plate, where your money at?
Bobby Brown on cake with a hundred packs
New editions, Lisa Lisa
We were secret lovers, had to get a beeper
My Atlantic star, not a Notre Dame
Not a student loan, tried to motivate
Continental, my Bentley, this shit should be illegal
Selassie eye in the ghost, thousand bales of that diesel
Lord, go toe to toe with any pussy boy
Fuck, one time for Face and all the Boobie boys
26 inch plates on a 68
Where I'm from a half a key'll set a nigga straight
I just wanna make the car notes
Let mama make the pot roast
You should meet me at the car wash
Washin' all 8, that's inshallah
(Z-Ro)
So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets

I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle till I see the dirt
Riskin' 25 years just to see another verse
(Nas)
Speakin' for those squeakin' in them cell blocks readin'
To blacks, whites and Puerto Ricans
Brothers with those ankle bracelets, impatient for their releasin'
To make it back to the block, the hatred, the present
Time sure flies, look how many years went by
My young niggas already need hair dye
Alcoholic faces, women bad as a mug
Gettin' fat as fuck
Fried food be addin' up, the system thrives off its victims
They ask how this economic collapse
Can affect people all over the map
Tea party for tax reenactment is whack
The past the past, yo, to my vatos out in the East Los
Nietas on the east coast, shouts to Puerto Rico
Dominican Republic people, rep I
Brown and black, we must get it together
The prison industrial complex a fuckin' set up
The Aztec, Olmec, African settled on this land from the get up
I changed my aim, who I'm gon' wet up
When violence is resorted, knowledge is distorted
Unless it's payback for brutality
I'm more or less with that, get back
(Z-Ro)
So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do

I flip, make hits, and stick like peanut butter
Five g's to the homie my money he didn't stutter
The gutter with the gats, fuck that, we need the lucho
It ain't no in between such things as being neutral
We shoot y'all, answering to me if it's needed
Catch you in the bucket and fuck it we gon feed it
We bleed it, A-K spray and nine milla
You fuckin' with a killa for scrilla
Money wanna deala
Peel 'em from the back and fact, you're ass out
Throw you in the trunk, we bump and mash out
We blast out and get the fuck outta dodge
And leave your body corpse parked at the Travellodge
You can't reason with a fool with guns and no brains
Thrown off your balcony get stoned and let's remain
We stressed main, paper come up short
Plus this bitch with my baby tryin' to take me to court
I need a new quarter, plus my screws is loose
Makin' niggas wanna pour shit down like orange juice
I one two, and slap the fuck outta you
So go on about my business bitch, and do what you do
You like to run shit
Do what you do
You fuck with powder bitch?
Hey yo, do what you do
You turn dyke too
Yeah, do what you do
But if it's fuck me bitch, then it's fuck you too
If you build a heist

Kryptonite got me blowed 'cause I hit it five times
I got condom on my dick, but my mind is on scrilla
Bitches just respect this nigga Chuck and I'ma killa
Me and my nigga, four hoes, weed, and liquor
Headed to the boat to freak these bitches on the river
And since I'm from the south these hoes showin me love
And B is from the west, he really don't give a fuck
Twenty minutes later, all hell broke loose
Bitches suckin dick and lickin' up nut juice
One bitch said she like to eat pussy too
She looked at me, I said shit, bitch, do what you do
Bitch you like suckin dick?
Do what you do
Homie, you like to eat pussy?

Hallelujah can tell this
Devin's got some shit wouldn't give a fuck if you dissed
Because shit to each's own and each owns voice
You can be stealin killin' or chillen whateva your choice
Smoke some weed smoke ya pipe fuck it
Life if how you live it
I grab tha mic while tha DJ groove it (turntable scratch noise)
Explicit lyrics is what um known to kick
Trying to make money so I can make honeys blow on mah dick
I go on a quick mission to find some kil'
Ain't no big deal, just hop in tha Seville
Mah homey put me down quarter pound for a bill
Wake up in tha morning and I have weed still and I chill
With tha brothas sippin coffee
Too old to be listenin' into what you say so hoe get off me
You're born in this world by ya self and you die alone
So as long as ya grown ya might as well gone and just
Do what tha fuck you wanna do (Go ahead and just)
Say what tha fuck you wanna say
What did it all mean?
Say what you want hoe ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you
So do what tha fuck you wanna do
Now everybody's got elders and you should respect um
They been through similar shit but then again you can't let um
Put they hands on ya life like a remote control
Have you travelin down tha same bumpy tore up road
Now close friends and relatives they should be constantly by ya side
And understand you gotta let ya conscience be your guide
There'll finally come a time for ya self you must decide
Cause you only get a ticket might as well enjoy tha ride and just
And there's a couple of fucked up man made rules that we should follow
But you gotta realize you just might not wake up tomorrow
And tha dollar you earn is tha dolla you spend
Go get sumthin for ya kids or buy a bottle of gin
Is it a sin? I 'ont (don't) know
What X and O's in this game
Tryin' to survive, tryin' to get high, tryin' to get by and stay alive
So (Do it till ya satisfied) Not just a lil bit
But wait until ya eighty and start sayin' what you couldda did
But what did it all mean?
Say what you want hoe ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you
So do what tha fuck you wanna do

Dollar...

I'm bout my game
Can't take shit light
Rich today
Be broke tonight
I duck the pin
'Cause I seek the light
On my grind
My grind's my life
My life's my hood
My home is slums
My boys is deep
Hoes is young
Funk is here
I'm out the way
I stash the cash
For that rainy day
Those days to come
My storm awaits
I save for now
For babenapes
For cars and wheels
For grills and chains
For cows and bulls
For screens and bang
For candy paint
My life done changed
My kids is grown
I needs the bank
My bank foreal
I leaves behind
A name that lives
For years uhuh
Big weed and drink
Rims and candypaint
Fresh shoes and clothes
Keep several hoes
Y'all idolize
Me, I do it for the dollar
Girls slide down the pole
Niggas trick for hoes
We sell tons of dope
I ain't never broke
Ain't my fault that the world revovles the dollar

I dips to clubs
Gets major play
From major hoes
In a major way
Short skirts and boots
Thick ass with thighs

Come fuck me eyes
Got hoes with jobs
Got hoes with games
Got freaky hoes
That dance with hey
They likes my style
And I like they ways
She wants what's mine
And I want what pays
I love these hoes
Without my heart
I fucks they mind
Not private parts
They falls in lust
Dick game in truth
She leaves her man
'Cause I keeps her loose
She dreams of me
Just met the chick
She mean to you
'Cause you stressed the bitch
I takes her home
You sweat the shit
She rolls her eyes
Like the exorcist
It's in my blood
Been real for deep
Ain't changed a bit
I claim the streets
I've left the hood
But made it back
Sold cocaine
Smoked and I jacked
Prophets from crack, bought cockpits and gats
Bulldogs and hogs
My life I rap
Put down in words
Dope fiends in packs
My block I love
And they love me back
Homeboys is feudin'
Got hate for none
I rise foreal
I stay with guns
I sleep alone
'Cause I trust myself
Respect for all
But I deals in death
That's real in depth
Can't bite my tongue
I speaks my mind
That's where I'm from
That's how I'm raised
I'm cut from that
That's how I'm made

Simply because these niggas got bank accounts that's bigger
I just can't get no peace from you motherfuckin rollers
Everytime I pull my Benz-o out, you pull me over
I'm sick of motherfuckers who be jocking Whitey's coattails
Blacker than a motherfucker, sweat me 'bout my dope-sales
Niggas just take your cut and get your ass up out my face
The only thing you probably get from me is a cock-sucking pistol case
Unless you plan on plantin a lil' somethin' in my shit
Just because you ain't got shit, bitch!
Give 'em a badge and a trigger and that makes 'em figure
That they can fuck with a million dollar nigga
They got you mixed up, fixed up at the Segas, shookin Indo
Gettin' fucked up in the gank-hole
The only way you'll whip that motherfucker is when you whip that motherfucker
And we choke the motherfucker (Man, fuck that motherfucker!)
So when you hear my song and wanna get it on
You better come prepared motherfucker, you dyin' wit'cha boots on

Niggas gettin' caught, doin' time, so they snitchin
They pickin' niggas up on a funky ass suspicion
We'll be goin' down for some questioning we think
And end up gettin' hit with the fuckin' kitchen sink
Racketeer and laundering, Kingpin wondering
If they got some unsolved murders, then give him some of them
Just because we're niggas and they figure we're no smarter
We'll sell each other out, and start rattin' on our partners
They start bringin' up shit that happened back in '85
And then comes the largest jury, bitch, they fuckin' time!
You might as well play the state cause you gon' do day for day
And sellin out your homeboys ain't the shit
'Cause y'all gonna have to die in this bitch, bitch!

Seen it all, it ain't too much I ain't done yet
Let my nuts hang, nigga I ain't scared of shit
Seen death in my eyes, musta not have been time
'Cause I'm the last of this motherfuckin breed of mine
Yeah and can't nobody tell you no different
The nerve of this motherfucker sayin' I'm tripping
The nerve of you motherfuckers questionin this
When I'm as real as a realass nigga can get
And I was raised with that g-code imbedded in my blood
And I would rather die than tell on a nigga from my hood
Or tell it on a motherfucker period
I take the code to the game that serious
The streets got rules, it's certain shit you don't do like
Sayin' it was me when you knowin' that it was you
It's not defamation if what I'm sayin' is true
Picked a fight, got beat, now this pussy is tryin' to sue
Bitch, you knowin' what the outcome was
Fuck with one fuck with all, we were bound by blood
Not the blood of the gang but the blood of James
It's out of love for this nigga we pump slugs in frames
That's the type of dude you're listenin to
Soft to you for a minute then I'm trippin' with you
And since you want it with me I'll position them goons
They carry out the order to this mission and boom
Ya out, now what was all this chit-chat about?
A word from the wise, keep my dick out ya mouth
Apparently I been too lenient on dudes
Cause you niggas done forgot who the streets belong to
I'm the motherfuckin king, I'm the motherfuckin mayor
I'm the president, the don, the boss of all players
Remember me, the one you got your idea from?
Well I'm still here, planted on this block I slung
So fresh and so clean, complicated rhyme schemes
You niggas is monotone, ain't no fuckin' with heat
I'm a motherfuckin g and if I'm lyin' then poof
May the Lord strike me dead in this motherfuckin booth
I'm the truth, emeritus, the F-A-C
The M to the O to the motherfuckin B
OG, to the critics analyzing my shit
Thinkin' so-and-so is better, you can suck my dick
'Cause it's been 20 years and counting and I still ain't bouncing
Fuck the club I'm a true thug, the realest nigga out here
Yeah I listen to them bullshit caps
Or how they so-called shine but that bullshit's wack
Steady on my grind and when I pull this strap
I'ma show you what I mean by ""These fools just rap""
'Cause I'm just as greedy as the next man is
I see 'em sellin and then I'ma feed my kids
And it is what it is, you can take it how you want it
Motherfuck who I offend they can meet me on the corner
It don't matter who you is or where you come from punk
When you see me that's the motherfuckin bell, bitch, jump
'Cause I'm tired of you niggas disrespecting the great
I am legend, it ain't nobody fuckin' with Face

And everybody's playing for keeps, most people pray that
We all make it up out this godforsaken place that we've been all faced with
We take our chances but they all wasted
And once again you see me (marching, mobbing)
But how long must I continue to see my homies dodgin these marksmen
The whole nine put on the line but never in mind to become the head sergeant
We all targets, the votes are in, but they ain't ours
We got these politicians running their game to regain power
While our whole black community sours
Crime rate towers, plagued by white powders
And they claim to helping us to clean up our community
But ain't no open opportunities, impunity
Is what these demons use to regulate
We keep in mind we can run but we can't hide cause the streets we walk are never safe
Still all my shattered hopes and dreams remain scattered
Broken into thousands of pieces, smashed and tattered
But it don't matter, hipocrisy in your democracy
Is stopping me, so I'm retaliating properly
Theologically, society has got me pressured by the hate
And Heaven knows I have faith, I have faith
(I just wanna celebrate) --> Rare Earth
(I just wanna celebrate)
Have faith
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)
Rudely awaken from this bad dream
Thinking my conscience wants to tell me something because of these bad things
(Past things) got me in the center of these mad dreams
(Flashing) homicidal (?) fatal slashings
Now I'm asking: explain to me these visionaries Brad's seen
(Past things) sad things killed him 'cause he had dreams
(A sad scene) but all I ever wanted was my mind back
Now I'm that nigga trying to find out where his mind's at
The time that it took myself to figure out my mind's gone
My mind crack, slide back, look at all the time gone
Rewind back, comeback, understand my life gon' make these cuts that won't change
But things look so strange, the plague
I gots to get myself up out the frame
Try to maintain the same game flipping 10 and flame Jane
A damn shame, people gots to always check your background
To jack now, come jack now and I'ma leave you flat down
Come back now or back down, homie, this is always all day
(Killer) in these dark and lonely hallways
Cause all they wanna see is all us brothers boxed up in caskets
With plastic bags in every bathroom getting blasted
It's drastic, mama help me calm down cause your son's sick
Don't watch me get gunned down for the dumb shit
Then the gun click and now I see the other side of black space
My last day, sad case, Heaven knows I have faith
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)
New day brings about change, everybody's searching for the light
The daydream schemes of living life
Has got us tossed up, believing we controlling our motions
Got the answer in space beside the view behind the ocean
And adapting to the everyday struggle's got us stressed
Cause the fact we know we here one day and could die the next
You've insisted to take equipment to the solar system
Trying to ensure your sole existence
Now tell me: do you think that when the bang goes boom
You can pack up all your things and aim for the moon?
It's unlikely, but you might be equipped with with proceeds to save lives
But you die when the King say die
You can race it but you can't shake it, stop trying
Try to hide it, cause you can't face it but you're born dying
God, please forgive us 'cause we're human not perfect
And the devil try to fronting but it's not working
How can we all sit suspended in space
Just spinning in place and ain't extended in faith
Man, wait -
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)

31,For Real,1997,The Untouchable (1997),,Scarface,"I got this coffee pot of white soap
Stuck my hanger down the center
When I entered I spent it cause it was like dope
But on the real-a he was jackin' me for scratch
Cause out of 36 ounces this motherfucker brought me 20 back
I'm slanging 20 sacs 'cause I done lost 16
And these goddamn streets ain't going to bring me back
Now could it be the southside big baller
Bolo rock slanger stones done got slaughtered-damn
I'm going up on my whole thangs
And stepped on don't go runnin' my clique 'cause it's a old game
And all I ever wanted was some hundred stacks
I went from slangin' o-z's to movin' hundred sacks
Gotta make my money back
'Cause I done came too far up in these goddamn streets
To get my money snatched
I'm so for real about this motherfuckin skrill
That any obstacle obscuring my paper is gettin' killed
For real
(Scratching and mixing)
All I have is this small skrilla
I know this nigga run this game of life
So motherfuckin sheist that at night he got to sleep with lights
'Cause he done come across with shit so shade
That mutha fuckers comin' with clips to locate him
Ain't no waitin and once they spot him they gon' sure face him
And once the got him they gon' sure waste him
This ain't no mutha fuckin' joke nigga it ain't worth it
And even if your mother gets in it you can't surface
It was all purpose
Just like that bullshit you was serving it was all purpose
We all chipped in nigga and we all hurting
I gots to grind just like in eighty-nine
When a niggas 25 cent pieces look just like baby dimes
I'm on the corner selling whole eights
I don't remember being this fuckin' paranoid since I sold weight
I went from 50 sacs to 50 packs
And all because this motherfucker got jipped he wants to jip me back
But when I find him I'm gon finalize him
Just to let a nigga know I'm for real and down to die for mine
And I'm for real about this mutha fuckin' skrill
That any obstacle obscuring my paper is gettin' killed
For real
Game made to be swift since eighty-six when I started
Seems like niggas with hustle got outsmarted
Cause now they wanna analyze they homies for scratch
Catch them when they sleeping come down and up scrap
And even though I plotted hittin' niggas for ends
I never took out straps and shot gats at friends
It was all about being for real where I was from
Where very few niggas came real but I was one
I dedicate this to my homies stuck in battle
Living life being caught up in this mutha fuckin' gamble
The game made to be changed but the niggas still started
Cocaine seems to be blamed for the niggas gettin' slaughtered
How many times you had your homie shot
By the same mutha fucker whose game came from your homies block
Niggas get caught up in the paper chase
And lose respect for the game
That was honored before the cake was made"

Just when they thought it was safe
I picked up the phone and called it a day
I bought a new car, caught a new case - fuck it
The harder I walk, the ground shall shake
Stompin, the harder I march, the ground will break
I am, groundbreakin, like an earthquake, heh-heh
Yeah, I run this shit, but I'll tackle it
You want me to break it down, I'm a fracture it
My mind is wanderin, I can't find it
But ten times outta ten, my mind on the mon-ey
Bandana around my head like I know karate
And I'll wax a nigga's ass like Mister Miyagi
And it ain't over till the fat lady sang
And that bitch got a whole lot more weight to gain
And call me by my new name

I take niggaz from the jump when they step to me with that bullshit
I am a fool, bitch, a native H-Town from the south side of Houston
You're tuned to the sounds of a nigga, who don't give a fuck
'Casue one way or the other
I'm gon' still get mine, play the game, motherfucker
The truth is in the building and I came tonight
And I done sold so many records, change my name to life
'Cause I can breathe into the hood, make it feel my pain
And even though they try to change me, I remain the same
And even if I did have that chrome-plated grill on my shit
I come from out the motherfuckin bricks
Now, never forget, where I come from, son

33,Fuck Faces,1998,My Homies (1998),,Scarface,"(Scarface)
Man I met this chick so fine
So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, it's me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces
You must be used to all the finer thangs
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
(Too $hort)
I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her got to stop and look
'Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
'Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch
(Devin)
Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin' this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
Piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
Nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuch her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my sidee
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and onlly
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces
(Tela)
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her neices
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fuckin' for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind 'cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through
Damn hoe I must admit, that's whit it hit me
So I dips into the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex Chases

34,Fuck You Too,2015,Deeply Rooted (2015),,Scarface,"(Scarface)
You know they always say, man, it's tough being at the top, huh?
I couldn't agree with you more
Jealous hearted motherfucker
Never been able to fuck with me nigga, ever
Super solid from day one
Never put myself in a compromised position, I'm a chess player
And if I did... I'd just shoot my way out
First born to my momma
I come from the place where you're promised
To die before your 21st
You'll be surprised what's underneath the earth
Dug dirt, I put bones there
All my enemies is gone now
I can't sleep through the cold sweats
Flashbacks, I'm a known threat
God fearing yet I'm evil though
I think deep, I believe in ghosts
Ever felt the hand of a dead body?
Then you know why I took my gun and head-shot him
War started over dope cuts
I put what I live by on both nuts
It's either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU!
(Z-Ro)
Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long
My M.O. is like ""fuck you!""
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
I'mma reach out and touch you
I ain't gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!
I live like I spit it
Raised by the wolves so my mentality is ""get it""
A life on the streets takes commitment
The power that you gain gets addictive
The money being made gets you bitches
A real nigga played the game like it's business
A weak nigga facing time, go to snitching
Plotting on his whole team 'cause he ain't wanna listen
If it was all good just a week ago
Take your motherfucking charge, that's your key of dope
We all wanna eat, gotta feed folks
Take an oath on the streets called the G code
That's what we live by, die for it
I got homies standing firm doing time for it
We have 5K1 [?] killers [??]
We gon bust that nigga, fuck that nigga!
Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long
My M.O. is like ""fuck you!""
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
I'mma reach out and touch you
I ain't gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!
They jealous of me 'cause I shine bright
Grind strong plus my mind right
My gun loaded up in both clips
Jump out on me wrong and meet the four fifth
No shit, this is music you can drive-by
G's the only code we abide by
Blunt burning in the ashtray
Playing faggot games and now your ass chafe
Niggas wearing tight pants and high heels
Claiming another nigga's hood that is not real
I am still the hardest nigga being heard
Fuck he claiming he real when he ain't keep his word?
He ain't fooling me, my nigga, he is just a nerd
Nothing but a rap tune, he ain't seen a bird, word
I talk that shit that I can back, though
Cause that's in my boxing game, I'm in the back, hoe
Talk that big six but pack a double blank
You where trouble ain't
Just another saint, fuck 'em!"
35,Fuck'n With Face,2003,Balls And My Word (2003),,Scarface,"(Scarface)
Fears weightless, I fear none in the physical form
Let us face, nigga, you can't do me no harm
Up here shakin, wishin me well, but deep in you heart
You wantin me close to make sure I don't ease in the dark
And squeeze wit thought, and leave you with the hole in your head
For wantin me dead, but I come to watch you suffer instead
Like burnin your bed, 'cause I don't want your blood on my hands
That's not in my plan, to unstrap it and murda ya man, I murda ya man
And I go home and got your blood on my clothes, and I'll be guilty
But werent you the one who stepped on my toes, So I ain't guilty
At least that's how I see it inside, an eye for an eye
He challenge me and he gotta die, so I send him a kite
To let him know that wasn't right, and he in my sight
And I can't let him leave in the night, and he seein his life
Flashin right in front of his face, for fuckin' wit face
This what you get for fuckin' wit face
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Open your eyes, 'cause seein is believin my nigga
And stop breathin and now your ass is leavin' my nigga
Protectin your chest, believin you put life in this bitch

Break it down for me
What you want me to do, What you want me to do
What you want me to do, What you want me to do
I got in-trouble rhymes to adapt to in-trouble times
A double nine, in case niggaz get out of line
And heaven knows that I done tried to change but in the midst
Of tryin' to be a better me, trouble was all I could seem to see
And the facts that I know tomorrow ain't promised to be
So from this day forth, Ima be all that I can be
When my cousin turned his back on me, I had to be my own man
Regardless of what the stakes was, Ima play my own hand
And I'm tired of bein let down be my so called friends
And regardless of the bloodshedin, ain't no tears in the end
Father please forgive me for I'm sinnin, forgive us all
But I ain't to blame, the lunatics were in my heart
And I think I need to build another wall
'Cause I don't want the world to see me
'Cause lately these niggaz been tryin' ta eat me
I'm exhausted and my body sleepy, But at lest its hard to rest
I'm a nervous wreck, I walk with stress
I used to walk around with a tech, but nowadays I be like fuck it dawg
You fuck wit me I gots to fuck wit y'all
And revenge is just another word for payback
Payin' you back today for this grudge that I had for you way back
You niggaz knew I wouldn't play that
I sent you bitches to the morgue with two holes in your head, no remorse
Why you think my niggaz call me the boss
'Cause I be dressed up in designer suits
And for the fact that these niggaz know that I'm the truth
And I always look a man in his eyes before I shoot
And when he disrespect this man of respect, there ain't no excuse
I call on the troops, and put them dead on your case
For fuckin' wit face, this what you get for fuckin' wit face
(Scarface)
This nigga tried to hit me yo, but he killed one of my people tho
So now I got to get this ho, they say revenge is expensive so I
Chartered a plane and I hit the coast, when I ran across this kid I know
We spoke briefly but we spoke in code
Tryin' deeply to destroy his soul
I keep it real 'cause the streets is watchin me
??? 'Cause the beats is jockin me
And all in all it was a smooth ride
Except for when this dude tried to hand me this conspiracy
See, I pimp the game like it's a prostitute
And I won't stop until I clock the loot
Misunderstand me and I cock and shoot
Plus, I done learned what to do and what not to do"

Got a bank account, so I can stack some g's
And have nice things like cutlass on d's
Fresh candy paint, chicken shit live
And fuckin' with this whip before I'm old enough to drive
My teacher can't stand me 'cause I give him no respect
I ain't sayin' ""m'am, yes m'am"" until you're signin me a check
So you can miss me with that muthafuckin bum shit

Give it to me, baby, let me show you what that deuce like
Let me hit the swisher and let me show you what my juice like
Rippin up shit in '93 like a chainsaw

Scope a 40 bag and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park and got up under the tree
Pull the swishers out and gave the ganja to 3
Rapped us up a fattie and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin' red 'cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin' 'cause it's all good
And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood
But other niggas don't wanna see it that way
But all I got to say is: you don't wanna see that S.A.
Because we're all upon a mission
Killin' don't make us no different
And dyin' don't make it no different
'Cause I done been to mo' wakes in this past year
Than the muthafuckin Bingos lost last year
So ain't no muthafuckin' thang for me
To kill a nigga who ain't fuckin' with the gang with me
Formaldehyde smokin', niggas gettin' loc'ed and
Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scoping, hoping for you to fuck up and slip
So we can have a reason for fuckin' up your shit
(It ain't no muthafuckin' peace when they see me)
'Cause we never had a muthafuckin' peace treaty
So I know I got to get 'em with game
And when I hit 'em with the game I gotta hit 'em with this damn thang
'Cause it's kill or be killed, never cut slack
And if you cut slack, they bust back, fuck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
'Cause if they bust one time, that be the worst one
And that's the one that can close the shop
So you gotta stand and hold the glock
Cause in my muthafuckin' hood, that's how it be
But when you're rollin' through your muthafucking hood, what do YOU see?"
38,Game Over,1997,The Untouchable (1997),,Scarface,"Man, what's up with these niggas out here
Mad at us 'cause we on top
I love to see niggas gettin' money
Better get it while the gettin' is good
Get it while you can, man
And stop hatin' me, fuckin' with my shit, 'cause I got more hustle than you
Get yours, get yours, baby
I'm seeing millions, niggaz don't understand
Nnow what? I'm makin' moves, puttin' cash behind plans
To blow up, will he style like this
Every day, I parlay, sip Henne and Tanqueray
Stay in the mix like Alezay
V.I.P., my shit parked valet
On the prowl again, to get honeys familiar with the smile again
Some try to assault Dre, it's still cavi
I'm eatin' steak while they struggle to break the slave mentality
I givin' livin' definition long as my hearts tickin'
I fought and made the world listen
Whatever fly Dr. Dre invented
Turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on sixty inches
I push a Rover, shit platinum before the session's over
Rap master with the Houston heat holder
These playas best to get they shit in check
'Cause when I get my hustle on, ain't no playin' with a full deck
Lord, please, murder my enemies (Yeah)
Burn 'em at a thousand degrees
And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese

'Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No)
Buck the whole world
Meant that, gotta stay strapped
'Cause ninety-nine a niggas, carry they gats
Super fist fightin' shit might come down to dyin'
When the time comes down for the tryin'
I got nine reasons why niggas shouldn't step in my face with the nonsense
'Cause I'm always heated, and you can taste this
Audi little something out the seams a my trousers
With no hesitation, I got a team to come clown ya
I down ya, so let your people know what they face
With the type of individual that'll bomb a sub-station
Kaboom, and everybody dies outside
There ain't no escapin' the Reaper, so don't try
Go ahead, close ya eyes, who the next to step?
Face down, hit, bleedin' on the steps o' death
Check yo self, you just been invaded by true soldiers
December thirty-first, ninety-six (the game is over)
Lord, please, murder my enemies (Yeah)
Burn 'em at a thousand degrees
And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese
'Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No)
(I've got all my life to live, plus with all my love to give)
Smokin' weed I never trail, I lead
Spendin' dough, tripped the cost of a ride like it was pocket money, Gs
But these are the things real playas do
Talkin' shit is real things that the hatas do
I'm namin' you
Shit's thick, it's time to run for shelter
I kept the word, things could happen to marks like it was helter skelter
Dear diary, I'm runnin' outta pages
Fadin', in and out, takin' purple hazes
The dazes, Revelations in the last stages
Red skies institute, the silent horns playin'
I'm prayin' with tears in my eyes
'Cause I'm tryin' to make it into eternal peace without dyin'
But they eyein' my bank account with beams on my Rover
The killa failed to launch his attack (the game is over)
Lord, please, murder my enemies (Yeah)
Burn 'em at a thousand degrees
And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese

Awww baby!
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh!
(Scarface: in background)
Yeah
What do you mean, ""Where am I at""
Tck! I'ma call you back
(Chorus 2X: samples)
Girl you know... (Awww!)
Girl you know I-iii-iiiih
Girl you know I-iii-iiiih love you (Awww baby!)
(Scarface)
I think if Adam would of had another squeeze he might
Not have ate those fruits from the leaves of light
Far as Eve, we could have been the more deceiving wife
Seeing the nigga had a weak spot and she was right
I just call it how I see it, she in love with him
And he in love too, and still be fucking all of them
Can you imagine you in lock with one breeze for life?
Waking up in the morning and laying down the night
With the same face looking at you all the time
Realizing now that happiness was hard to find
You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face
Plus she's always mad, and her sex ain't great
And she don't suck dick like she used to do
Force a nigga into trying to find him something new
And on the real, I done seen it when it went like this
But girl there's one thing happening that you can't forget
(Scarface)
But you can never be my main boo, we can remain cool
But we can't be seen and for this I can blame you
Because you got more miles than a F-350
You been ran through, and I know for a fact you got history
But since we met, I've been hearing your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like a turtle
And you can catch a nigga on the late night
Coming out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite
You make a man out of your clit, that's how you handle the dick
It's unlike no other, she a bad motherfucker
But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover
Make me look fucked up, because unlike those others
I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan
So you can't get mad because I am not your man
Your under-standing was bad, it was not my plan
For you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that
(Scarface)
For me to say that, ""I do,"" would be a lie because I don't
Believe no woman is right for me so I won't
Try to talk myself into thinking she is
And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch
And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man
But for every one woman, there's a man, home man
Saying, ""Damn, I done spent six years in this shit
The first two was cool and then the bitch just flipped""
And then that's it, had to make some new plans
'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man
And you're hurt all along, steady hitting her phone
But a bigger dick and longer bank roll, she gone
And if I ever say, ""Maybe,"" and you thought that I might
You consider, just imagine what my wife was like
And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own
And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone"

And for you to stress a nigga like I'm running these hoes is outta line
Goodbye to your life, pack up your clothes and go

Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I've given all of me so unselfishly
And now he's at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I Go
I'm about to hit some spots with my guys from outta town
And there you go making those mean old eyes
Feel like I'm in prison sometimes
Like my freedom is gone like I've committed a crime and that's some bullshit
You watch a nigga like I'm 6 years old, how the fuck you think this shit gon? grow
I?ma tell you how this shit gon? go
I?ma hop off in this clean ass triple silver Porsche Turbo and hit the road and Go
You run a nigga blood pressure up from that spite shit
And normally I don't fuck with that type bitch
But she got a nigga feeling her though
Text messaging my phone I feel like killing this ho
But before I let her get on my row
I?ma hand the bitch her walking papers letting her go and hit the door
But yo, I ain't never seen a UFO
And I ain't never seen a ho that's more important that dough
So Go

Leaving out a strip club and wanting my fuck on
I'm strolling through a list of my missed calls
And right up out the blue man this bitch calls
You coming over here (woman's voice)
I'm like shit naw
So to question that decision she eats up a dick raw
But man, I'd rather go to bed with a hard dick
Than to have to spend the whole night fucking and arguing
This bitch a lunatic, fuck a nigga high off
I wish it was I way I could hit and just drive off
But that's not happening
So I?ma lay my ass down, watching girl's gone wild penis in my hand
Hardest times and I don't wanna sell out
Still I'm putting on my flip-flops to bail out
I grab my keys off the table and coat
It's an open invitation for a nigga to score, so I go!

If I had to play God for a day
I would open up the gates, let the world see my face
Remove all doubt from the ones without the faith
And put them on the path of the straight
A safe place, for the young to come out if they want to play
I let their mommas know that they ok
And when y'all pray, I'll respond so you can all see a sign
And answer every pray one at a time
If I'm God huh, all the stabbings all the war would come to cease
My whole entire hood would be at peace, no more beef
And you could sleep without the fears of being woke
By the sounds of sirens, screams of people being smoked
No more dope you don't need it, you'll be cured of all diseases
Your whole entire life would be deleted
Please forgive me I've been dreaming
And rudely interrupted by the demons
Laughed at the picture I was seeing on the ceiling
(John Legend)
Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait till I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has a face
(Scarface)
Just imagine if the devil had a day
And God had took a break and walked away, would you feel safe?
If everything you loved turned into hate
Will the dark angel's evil show you grace
Only to be eaten by a snake, one life one mistake
Be careful of the choices that you make, cause one day
You'll be standing on your feet and then the next
You're underneath the sheet greeting death
I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest
Stealing breath, shortening my days even less
Lost souls never rest, a killer walks the streets seeking flesh
A adolescent hangs she's depressed
A priest who confessed, a judged typing a nigga in a text
Your honor, what the fuck did you expect?
A father kills his son look at life it's a mess
Just imagine what would happen if the lord up and left
(John Legend)
Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face
I don't want to wait wait, wait till I die
Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close
Smile on your child so he knows
God has face
(Scarface)
When all that you believed in was a lie
Are you willing to accept it when you find out
Or try to reason with yourself that's what it is when it's not
And all the whole while it's been a plot
To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact
That they keep us in the dark know they act
We react all surprised and not realize that this shit a trap
Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasn't that
The church and these politics they all full of crap
It's a shame but that's how were blaming it's for the scratch
So I don't knock I'm tryna to put a black card in my wallet
But some dollars in my pocket ain't the topic
Y'all need to stop it
This is just crazy these little babies ticking time bombs
Walking around the lunchroom pulling guns
If momma and daddy took the time to raise their son
Then the sister wouldn't be the mom before she twenty-one huh
(John Legend)
Who listens when we pray
Who pulls the strings of the world as we struggle today
Will you show your face

Wait wait, wait for my eyes to close

I turned the corner, hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away
(Now where's she staying?) she must be new in the hood
But I ain't trippin' on that shit, 'cause it's all good
I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name
Ain't a damn thing changed, ain't no shame in my game
She said, "" Used to go Thomas""
I slowed my roll, 'cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas
Now where your man at, she said ""Gone at work""
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinkin', ""Go on and flirt""
My homies women ain't no thing to me,

Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face
Now that's the pits
She didn't have to put up a front
I stuck that ass back in there
And haven't called her for 3 months
I guess it's in me to be doggin' a chic
Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master
Let her take a ride with the Bradster
It cool, don't front ...ooh, no sex
No sweat-not even on my mind-we just met
And furthermore, we can get to those
But for now I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to hoes:

Parked my Ferrari, now I'm back in the coup
I knocked her boots - your baby's mama put me to work
I tagged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt
She wanted me badly so I put it inside
She got the (front, back, and side to side)
Back and forth with the gangster glide
Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9
Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the day
Now she's asleep, 'cause she just had her drawers full of dick
(Now that's sick) and plus she got you staying at home
With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on
So believe me when you downin' the Brad
I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass

It didn't sound legit, but still we chanced it
And if it came through, we hit a big lick
11-7 real clean
Then turn back around and sell them bitches for 17
We gathered up the money, we could score six
Headed out to meet him with 2 uzi's and four clips
Ready for whatever
If we went down, we went down together
We met him in his complex
Niggas were hanging out, ""You ready to roll?"" (Bet)
I knew it was fuckery
Wanted to see the money, said he never trusted me
But I can understand that
I got the money right here, now where's the fucking dope at
Now it's the time for the testing out the dope
To see if it's flour, sheep rock, or some powder soap
He went to his car to go and get it
And never came back, oh shit, I wasn't with it
Got me real mad
Now that's the first example of a good girl gone bad

Sticking around would be real dumb
Fuck this shit, I ain't waiting to see the outcome

I slammed on my brakes, grabbed my shit and got ready to spray
And that's about the time B woke up
Popped in his clip, and lit him a smoke up
Doing about 90 trying to catch him
We spotted the bastard, when they commenced the shooting at us
Somebody was riding in the trunk
The bitch flew open, that was a nigga with a pump
He aimed at the windshield (Duck!)
Blasting the seat and in our face (Aww fuck!)
Jay and Chief must have followed us
Pulled up beside him, and pulled out the ride gun
Put the driver's ass in check
We veered to the left and watch the muthafuckas wreck
We exited the freeway fast
A perfect example of a good girl gone bad
(Verse Three)
Now it's time to do him
Called up Mike to help us find him 'cause he knew him
My nigga was real pissed
Cause them hoes had him mixed up in the middle of this fuck shit
We followed Big Mike in his jeep
Snuck up on him and caught his ass in his sleep
His little boy was sleeping with him
I had to wake him up cause it was time to get him
But I ain't give a fuck what he done
I ain't gonna kill him in the presence of his fucking son
So I drug him outside
He started to beg ""Bitch be the fuckin' lying""
Took him to the bayou
Your ass has got to go for that bullshit you tried bro
""But what about my son?"" I got him
He's in real good hands, he closed his eyes then I shot him
Now his son is calling me dad
I got something more valuable than money, from a good girl gone bad"
47,Gotta Get Paid,2006,My Homies Part 2 (2006),,Scarface,"...Scarface ad libs...
...""Let me spit some game to ya""...
You gotta war on drugs
Well every other day a nigga dies
You showed yours, now let me show you mine
Bring the six o'clock news
And let me walk 'em in my shoes
Through what you call the inner city
And what I call the blues
I'm broke here, and I ain't wainting on a call
From a restaurant to bust tables
When Petie's got a job
Making 35 a week and all he do is run the streets
This nigga always caked up
Chromed out and draped up
Constantly telling me we need to get this paper
I'm getting skinny and it's he who get my weight up
Straight up
And plus I'm tired of missing meals
So I paid the man a visit...
[Petie] ""What's the goddamn deal?
It's good to see you dog
I thought you might've choked up
Respect and money, well I can get you both of 'em""
[Face] ...I went inside, watching him break it down
When he was finished he handed a nigga nine
A nine milimeter, nine zips
Said if I sold each one for nine, I'd have grip
I hesitated, I ain't never sold a stone
I done seen it fuck the hood up
Plus all my niggaz gone
And they ain't never coming out
So with that in consideration
I took the package and bounced
I'm headed home, dazing out in a zone
Eyes on my luggage, I'm abouts to get it on
Get to the house, spread it all on the couch
Getting this bank what it's about
That's how a nigga made
They got a nigga paid
I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave
Get money everyday
It ain't no other way
That's how it is until they put me in a grave
I'm in the living room looking at the news
Got a razor and some zipper baggies
About to do the fool
Cutting hundred dollar slabs
Wholesaling niggaz halves
Getting money like a muthafucka
Serivng niggaz bags
Got the blocks all blowed up
The whole hood smoking
Got a pistol I ain't shot yet
So dude's wide open for it
I'm just a youngster, I ain't done it, but I will
'Cause I was taught you got to get it
So I get it how I live
Finna get my ma a crib, she ain't working
So I'm forced to win the bread for the household
'Cause dad was no support
Often in and out of court, caught a case out of town
Got a body on his conscience, but nobody made a sound
He was going through the motions
He gonna probably beat the case
Still I get down on my knees
And beg the Lord to let him raise
Get up and get my workers out
Supply 'em with the goods
Give instructions to the goons
To come up out the hood
I ain't gotta pay the fronters
So I'm finally finna raise
'Cause the bottom line is this homie
You gotta get paid
That's how a nigga made
They got a nigga paid
I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave
Get money everyday
It ain't no other way
That's how it is until they put me in a grave
I never learned a trade
I fuck with chess and spades
The only other game a nigga learned to play was
Working hopping yay
'Cause kissing ass was gay
I'm on my business, I want money like I'm jade
I'm the nigga in the hood
These little homies wanna be like
I got when shit was good
But now-a-days off in this street life
These niggaz switch it on you
Quick to put you in the crosses
Now he standing in your crib
And got a pistol in your mouth
That's your muthafuckin' boy
He popped you and popped your broad
Now he headed to the closet
And he about to take it all
So watch your muthafuckin' friends
'Cause them the ones that sell you out
Ain't no future in being loyal
When niggaz see you want the top
Jealous hearted muthafuckas
Always quick to say you hating
I don't want another homie dog
He swallowed that and chased it
You can make it like I made it
I think it's best you do it dolo (solo)
That way niggaz can't say shit about you
When talking to the po-po
Oh yo, you know that dude that fronted me my come up
I caught him coming out the neighborhood
And had him done up
That's why I'm skeptic
When it comes to different faces
'Cause I know I got it coming
But till then, I'll get my bank, shit
(More ad libs)
...""Fuck you think this is?""...
...""More food for thought""...
...""That's how this shit go
Muthafucka been foolin' you, fuckin' with you
All your muthafucking life
And he the muthafucka talking to the people
You know... get that nigga ass outta here""...
...""I ride by my muthafucking self""...
...""Look for me""..."

Credit cards slit your throat now it won't let go
Yeah you've gotta get out before it takes control
It's a big black hole it'll swallow your soul
When greed is all that motivates
You'll hang yourself and seal your fate
And you'll go down swinging from an old tree
Suicide of the worst degree
It'll be too late to get yourself free
'Cause you'll be too far down
Was it worth the betrayal that made you bleed
To get your silver to feed your greed
Oh it's a deadly so don't let it in

What you want never need only fuels you're greed

50,Hand Of The Dead Body,1994,The Diary (1994),,Scarface,"-In world news today, officials agree that rapper Brad Jordan alias
Scarface must be stopped
-After being monitored by secret service agents for two years
-Evidence leads Tobacco and Fire Arms officials to believe that his
Literally dope lyrics promote drug usage and distribution
-Degrade women, influence gambling, promote and teach violence and more
Importantly
-Its influencing our minors and destroying our young community
-Officials say, he's the lord of underground rap and his music must be
Stopped
Scarface:
We got this whole motherfucker on a mission
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they callin on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me
Gangsta Nip, Spice 1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you tryin' kick some dust up
America's been always known for blaiming us niggas for they fuck-ups
And we were always considered evil
Now they tryin' to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Lets peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled
So why you criticize me
For the shit that you see on your TV
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus:(Repeat 2X)
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long
So now they tryin' separation
And sendin black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation
Tappin into our conversation
Saying the message that they give
Bring forth or premeditation
So David's got a silver mag
While listenin to Brad, David gets mad and kills his dad
David Duke's got a shotgun
So why you get upset 'cause I got one
A tisket a tasket
A nigga got his ass kicked
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket
An open and sgut situation
Cop gets got, the wanna blame it on my occupation
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me
Because the shit that I be sayin' ain't worse than no western money
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Ice Cube:
You best to free you're mine
Before I free my nine
And stop fuckin' with the void in pop
Or feel my hot rocks
Bang, bang, boom boom, ping ping I'm the black
White boys gat a magazine and don't kow how to act
I'll attack and make you vomit
Down with Kahlid Abdul Muhammad
Do he got a brother, I'm it now
I'm the illest
Wanna kill this house nigga Don Cornelius
Can you feel this?
You punk niggas make me sick
Suckin on the devil's dick
Scared of revolution
Need to start deuchin
Houston is the place
I caught a case
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face
But I bust two times to the gut
To the Reverend Calvin Butts
Gotta pair of nuts?
I started this gangsta shit in 86
Now you dissin me
For publicity
Isn't he a hoe to the third degree
Who me
I'm a g who like to scrap-a-lot
Down with Rap-A-Lot
And I can't stop, won't stop
So fuck Bill and Hillary
Ice Cube their ain't no killin' me
Ice Cube, Scarface
Droppin' on these sellin out niggas, doing it like this"
51,He's Dead,1993,The World Is Yours (1993),,Scarface,"Old McDonald had a farm
Ee-eye-ee-eye - my dick
(Is he dead?)
You can run but you can't hide, I find ya
Just when you think the shit is over, I'm standin right behind ya
You crossed the wrong muthafucka, now you paranoid
'Cause I'm a nigga these niggas just can't destroy
I'm on the hunt, so keep your shit low
But yo, I'm kinda slackin' up, I shoulda killed you from the get-go
Nigga, but this is it
We coulda talked it out like players, but now I'm on some gangsta shit
What possessed this muthafucka to try to punk me?
What possessed this muthafucka to tell me fuck me?
Guess he thinks that I'm a light weight
Hey yo, your shit's fucked up, so let me help you get your life straight
Cause niggas get they ass dunked
For fuckin' with me, I ain't no muthafuckin punk
Punk, I got some good hands, but I prefer my gat
Now where you at, 'cause I'ma slit your Kool-Aid pack
See, niggas got it all wrong
Some niggas fake the gangsta shit, so niggas think we all songs
They come up to a muthafucka jokin, mayn
They wanna test a muthafucka's boxing game
That's when they get they ass trunked
'Cause when you're fuckin' with me, I'ma tear this muthafucka up
You're fuckin' with a dread
You're takin' 2 to your head, I'm comin' fed
(Is he dead?) Yeah, he dead
""It had to be a murder""
""'Cause I'm a fuckin' killer by nature""
""It had to be a murder""
""I looked him in the eye -
Then I shot him in his face""
See, niggas make mistakes, black
They shoot, but they don't shoot to kill, so muthafuckas stray back
But I nip it at the bud
Because I'm not down for dyin', muthafucka, so I go for blood
And let 'em know I'm on some real shit
Not with these fake muthafuckas on the team who won't kill shit
I scream it like I mean it
I mean it like I scream it, cause, niggas, I done seen it
Muthafuckas with the false nuts
Come with the static and they get they funky ass shot the fuck up
So I give they ass a big blast
Instead of turnin' the other cheek, I get dead up in this bitch ass
Cause yo, this shit is real life
I'd rather be piped up in a box than be runnin' from a steel knife
So once I put your ass in the red
I'm goin' for the head
Just makin' sure you're dead
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""You're dyin', hoe, and can't nothin' save ya""
It's over, I'm smokin' on some sweet leaf
Ready to put my dick up in this bitch named Charisse cheeks
A dick-sucker's nightmare
I'm wantin some action, so I'm rollin' through your hood and I be right there
I blew my horn 'cause I don't knock
The only thing that's on my mind is fuckin' this bitch and puttin' her ass out
But yo, this shit is breakin up
She's tellin' homie she don't wanna fuck, so homie loc is breakin up
It just so happened homie see my low
And now he's madder than a muthafucka, 'specially when he see me blown
And now he's got some beef, too
But yo, I ain't gon' squab my partner over this freak, du
So I cut the shit quick
And said, ""Yo, we ain't gon' have to come to ???? over this freak bitch
If you want her, you can have her
Because I got what I wanted, she sucked my dick, so, money, you can stab her""
But I said this to myself up
If I told homie I fucked his gal, then homie nut the fuck up
So I kept it on the down-low
And just laid back and watched the fuckin' reaction of this clown hoe
But this nigga is a real trick
He's talkin' shit and wantin to jump off into some ill shit
So I told him fuck him
And if he came a little closer, then I would have to buck him
He came a little closer, so I gave him one
(*Shot*) And left the muthafucka stunned
And right before I mobbed
I gave him one more for the road, just to finish the fuckin' job
So off with your head, bitch
'Cause I don't fuck around with that 'return from the dead' shit
I'm makin' sure I get you good
And if you twitchin like you still alive, homie loc, I wish you would
Cause that just gives me one more reason
To grab the trigger of this muthafuckin pistol and continue squeezin
I don't believe in second ghosts
You only get one chance, and if you slip, then yo ass is smoked
Some niggas say they feelin' this
But niggas ain't real with this
Cause niggaroes ain't killin' shit
But yo, I guess it's dead
And I be givin' you 2 to your muthafuckin head
Makin' sure you're dead
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
'Cause I'm a fuckin' killer by nature""
This is goin' out to
All those fake muthafuckas
I ain't gonna say no names
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
'Cause I'm a fuckin' killer by nature""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""

There's gonna be some shit you might not understand
But, you may have to rewind this shit a few times
Heaven, heaven
Check it out
I know tomorrow ain't a promise
That's why I live one day at a time
So when it's my turn, there be no crime
I'm aware that when my number's called I'm punchin' the clock
No need for screamin' at me momma, I'm out
And plus I wasn't really happy here to start with, let that be told
My old homeboy was robbin' me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, 'cause 2 don't count
When your own bloods bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is schemin?
And every other corner, you're passin' a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm rememberin' this
Your families your backbone, your friends ain't shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was sayin' ""Back in the days...""
When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl, everybody's sayin'
My angel
My sunshine
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
My best friend
My good time
That's the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
Listen to different scriptions, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religion, just ain't no song
I'm hearin' niggas makin' up scriptions, and playin' along
Probably sayin' I'm the hypocrite, for judgin' these folks
But you can tell he ain't a Christian, by the way that he spoke
I pray for everbody, hopin' that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down, boy
When you're aware of your surroundings, yet you still can't move
Water shootin' outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder, than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Who changed your life, when you hear it?
And the next morn', you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener, and the sun brighter
I know the feelin' first hand, I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life
And it was like (heaven, heaven...)
But I'm a man, I ain't perfect
That's a poor excuse, that ain't workin'
I asked him for forgiveness, for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
And tryin' and get to heaven...
America the Beautiful, don't be so cold
How do you expectin' our seeds gonna grow?
When you trap us in the ghetto
And show love, to the other muthafuckers
While we right here starvin' at home
I'd cry, if I thought, that me sheddin' a tear might help
Then again, me sheddin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the President, and see if he know help
Let him know you up shit creek yourself, we all sinners
Facin' the winter, with no socks, and no shoes
In a position, where we all gon' loose
Tell the penitentiaries, we gonna need more schools
Or what the fuck is we gonna do?
Sit around and let the world pass us by?
Waitin' on a message from the Revrand
And he ain't but another man, tryin' to get to heaven..."

Now how insane is that, had a change of heart
Though you have a worth then it came a pork
Then she hangs with boys you need to tell your broad
Said until she met him she never came this hard

I make her eyes, I try to brake her motherfuckin back

The other one is in a closed-top coffin
You're still talkin', like you the O.G.
When you was locked down though, you was low-key
Them niggaz told me that they had you in there
And the locals you was workin with the boys in there
And even had the nerve to go and try to talk to the streets
Thinkin' that they'd embrace a marked-as-police
And then you tried to sue a nigga, but it got back to a nigga
And when I see him I'm a do the nigga
So skip that funky-ass deposition fool
Since you wanna crank it up, then that's what I'm about to do
To high power"

Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all warrin'
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still

Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'

'Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause its deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't surface
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
He came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintian me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange

And me and you selling fucking toasted up (?)

Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No Limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
We ghetto niggas can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little J down at Rap-A-Lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake its for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
'Cause I be dumping niggas off from New Orleans to California
Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh)

But we young niggas in tennis shoes and diamonds

What do you get from boosting?
Niggas coming out from California to represent them niggas from
Houston
And now we rocking keep this shit popping
And all my niggas across the bay know L.A. keep the shit hot
I keep my glock inside my pants, don't give niggas a chance
To put me inside a casket you dirty bastards
Until the day I die you catch a nigga high off weed the police can't
Find me
My shit will drop and I'll sell five million
While all the niggas enter the game get caught up in drug dealing
How can I fall? how can I ball, how can I catch my enemies and murder
Them all?
My word of flame burn niggas inside their brain
Niggas can't hang with me, and like it changes, uh
Scarface got me on this shit
We laced it motherfuckers in their body and face, uh
Growing thicker, liquor made me daddy and nigga
Niggas don't wanna see me world wide mob figure
M.O.B. and the leaf keep me weeded
Them niggas don't wanna see me when I got weed in my system
Catch another victim, capture bodies
Bring a shottie to the fucking party, yeah
I party all night
I do this shit cause its wrong but we were born right
And to the niggas in my zone we do it long ways
Till these bitches understand nigga my song pay; 'cause I'm the man
Now these are my homeboys, we outlaws till the day we die
Keep this shit rough and raw my 45
Make sure that I survive to another day
To bust rhymes which from I get paid
Now that's the end of my freestyle but it was left for dead
But the shit away you can hear it playing, westside"

Uno is for the money, deuce is for the show
Trey is for the video, what the fuck is fo'?
Fo' is for the hoes, and 5 to stay alive
That shoulda been number 1, 'cause I don't wanna die
Add 6 when I begin to flip the big Benz
With the candy-coated paint, plus the 20"" rims
And what they hittin fo', I roll 7 out the do'
Took his bankroll, plus his diamond and his gold
8: 'Don't be late' is for my niggas paper-chasin
Got Nines for trick niggas in the game player-hatin'
10's is for my niggas locked down in the pen
And my niggas dead and gone, until we meet again
11 is for my poppy up in heaven
Tell God send me a blessing, 'cause I'm down here stressin
12 is for the records we sell, we're goin' platinum
There's no turnin' back now, so let's make it happen
All I ever wanted to do in my life was be a hustler
Some don't get it, but feel me when I spit it
It's all about the dollar
(VERSE 2: O.C. The Sinister)
It goes one for the money, two for the show
Everybody in the game know how it go
It's a whole lotta hoes, a whole lotta dough
Keeps me watchin on toes out my back window
Creep slow by the ghetto, we never go without the .44
For urban travel, watch the scandal
You petty rivals can't handle
Hit your block, increase props as we dismantle
Channel my vengeance through this sentence, I'm relentless
You bitches wanna spend this, then get pimped
We're never said to beat any listener senseless
Heavyweighters livin' major, pumpin this here, no circumference
Who is this? O.C. The Sinister
Navigatin, now we're raidin all over your area
I'm darin ya to static with this Rap-A-Lot shit
The Camorra make hits, tag licks, like movin bricks
The lyricist full of canabis, livin' extravagant
With elegant bitches, plottin riches
On quick-to-get-rich niggas full of liquor
C'll shine one time livin' bigger

Players like us do shows and pimp hoes
Oh-oh, it's the Sinister and Lo-Lo comin' through
Them niggas playa-hatin', what the fuck they wanna do?
I want peace, but if them niggas want beef
We gon' have to take the heat to the streets
Knawmean? They tryin' to stop dreams and block creams
It seems like what? They hate to see us havin' lavish things
Pictures in magazines, nice cars and diamond rings
Ah-ah, ah-ah, we can't have no fake niggas on our team

Don't make me up this motherfucker on some dumb shit

It's WC and Face back on 'em draulics

I keep 'em datin locals, hangin' on the center of rims
And hot ones, and these side guns will get you touched up
And if you think I'm just a rapper bitch ya got me fucked up
I ain't no nigga to be chasin no bitch lickin' her toes
Sharin ice cream cones, so play like the group I did bitch and get on
I'm a front line pusher, for the G's I stay on the defence
Stay by the lane and the gutter, bitch I ain't no sucka, not the one

Hit the neighborhood, let's get it on boy
Let's throw a barbeque, or we can blow dank

'Cause y'all are homeboys, kept the man fed
'Cause disrespect or not and come back and shed

Scarface: I don't know, dawg. Just trying to live it one day at a time, you know?
Man: I hear you talkin', man, live it one day at a time, it ain't nothin' but a thing though, bro.
Scarface: Yeah I hear you fool. Well let me get up outta here, man, my ride out here waitin' fo' me
Man: Aight, cat daddy, take it easy, baby.
Scarface: You stay up, fool. Peace.
Other man: Ay peace, Mob, stay true.
He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the man's child
The world is different since he's seen it last
Out of jail, been seven years, and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's letters
Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young, plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's calling up his homie who done came up
Livin' large, now they dealin' with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth land
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
Now it's different, he done did dirt
And realized killin' men meant coming up, but it still hurt
And can't nobody change this
It's 1994, and we up against the same shit
I never understood why
I could never see a man cry till I seen a man die
Man cry
Imagine life at its full peak
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief
Imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace
Everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for service, then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for the final test
(I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath)
How much longer will it be till it's all done
Total darkness at ease, be it all one
I watch him die and when he dies, let us celebrate
You took his life, but your memory you'll never take
You'll be headed to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face
I still gotta wonder why
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
I hear you breathin', but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of dying, so you hold on
And you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low
Stop trying to fight the Reaper, just relax and let it go
Because there's no way you can fight it though you still try
And you can try it till you fight it, but you'll still die
Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light, but you're still feeling outta place
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light
And you see the ones you never learned to love in life
Make the choice, let it go, but you can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God, you need to patch it up
But if you ready, close your eyes, and we can set it free
There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace
I still got to wonder why
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die"

A letter to the KKK from the black folks
I'm tryin' to get it on, tryin' to check the grip
And there goes officer cracker tryin' to sink my fucken battleship
Turnin' on his flashers, callin' up the dogs
Now my Lexus Coupe is flex surrounded by the hogs
Snatchin' out my seats, tellin' me I sell dope
Am I on probation or parole? I tell 'em fuck no!
Tell me mister officer, what's the problem?
What's the matter?
Why you gotta treat us like scum? Is it that a
Nigga's doin' a tad bit better than you?
And brutality is all that you crackers can do
And mark me up for resistin' yo ass
When in reality officer friendly kicked my ass, damn!
You overflex your authority too
Put your foot in my shoe, and let me try on your boot
So I can run it in reverse
You can treat me like god, and I can treat you like dirt!
The 22 years I been here I saw
Motherfuckers disrespect god before they disrespect the law

In the same streets that you killed me and my brothers in.""
Mister mister officer, mister officer, mister sergeant
Just because I'm young and I'm black I'm a target?
You say I'm sellin' dope but you fake
'Cause young dope dealers flash cash and make mistakes
And besides we ain't dealin' no mo'
Look at my hood, we ain't killin' no mo' so
Everybody's yellin' peace
The only war that's goin' on is goin' on with the police
'Cause they ain't stoppin' with the bullshit
If they could they'd lock us up with some chains and swing a bull whip
'Cause they figure they're the master
And they can take you to jail or take your lifes
Them sorry bastards
That makes me wonder why
The five-o can determine if we live or if a nigga dies
And to me that shit is bull
Only god can take life but I still gotta watch the law
It's bad enough I watch the next G
But even worse I gots ta watch the motherfuckers who protect me
They fucken packin gats yo
They serve and protect, they don't respect 'cause I'm black hoe

Police cars and watch jaw brains shad on the dashboard.
Why when you pull us over you show us your pistols before
You aks us for our drivers license? Somethin' is not right!""

Gettin' tailgated by a motherfuckin' copper
But I ain't got respect for you motherfuckin' dickheads
'Cause y'all was straight hoes back in school nerdy shitheads
I finally figured out why you bitches roll in packs
'Cause niggas who ain't shit talk loud and pack gats

You call the DEA
The DEA
Says I'm a known drug dealer
Straight born killer
A motherfuckin' wig splitter
He don't know shit about a nigga but I'm black
As far as he's concerned all niggas push crack
And plus I'm 22, that really makes 'em check
A drop-top Benz, Lexus Coupe, no respect
I gotta be hidin' somethin' from the demons
He gotta be slingin' yeyo, let's pay someone to spring him

I woke up to a tune on the radio, check it
An old church hymn behind a breakbeat record (yeah)
Sounded kinda funky so I pumped it, right
But rudely interrupted by a neighborhood street fight
When will you motherfuckers quit?
Every motherfuckin mornin it's the same ol bullshit
I peeped to see the thrashin
Some nigga runnin' with a butcher knife, screamin out ""Assassin!""
He ran by a friend of mine, it bugged him
His eyes showed fear, that's the reason why he stuck him
Anyway, that's how I seen it
You rarely see a nigga kill another nigga,
And he doesn't mean it
So that's the way I took it
Anyway the boy is dead, no matter how you look at it
And life goes on...
I was feelin' kinda funny - aiyyo something's wrong
I went to take a shower Duke
Bumped into the wall and I smooth went through
Now I'm thinkin' I'm in trouble
I reached to touch my face, but I couldn't feel my beard stubble
I screamed, ""Oh Lord help!""
Looked into the mirror and I couldn't see myself
I called up my mom's house
And realized somethin' was wrong, no doubt
She picked up, said ""Hello"" in a low tone
I said, ""Hey ma!"" and she hung up the telephone
Sick and lookin' weary
My cousin walks in, I said, ""What's up?"" but he didn't hear me
Started packin up my shit G
Looked at a picture of me, put it down and said, ""Rest in peace""
Realizin what he said man
I can't talk, I don't exist, I'm a dead man
Yeah I guess I'm dead right?
I'm goin' to the cemetery to peep out Action's gravesite
And sure enough, there it is
My mom and girl talkin', holdin' on to Brad's kids
I look into the box G
Son of a bitch! I don't believe it, that's me!
Momma kissed me on my head
Aww shit... I'm dead (I'm dead)"

Kiss and hold and hug shit, she be wantin thug dick

All the while you spoilin that bitch, so thinkin' 'fuck me'
Hard for you to see that, 'cause you be on that weak rap

A gentleman, fuck that, wearin suits, what's that?
You hit the hoe she lay there, I hit the bitch she fuck back
Makin' voices, noises, voices and noises (moaning)

Pussy hole swole up, every time she roll up

Now I admit, I didn't put my prick up ya gal
She saves her pussy for you, she's just my dick sucking pal
She tells me her problem, I like to listen and learn
And I don't mind because she's always got a Swisher to burn
And a six-pack, I sit back, chill while she drives
With her skirt pulled down and her panties to the side
Wanna smoke, what's up, open up the glove compartment
Grab the Swisher, kiss her, get my lighter and spark it
Don't know how she do it nigga but when she be drivin'
She be slobbin and bobbin while she's givin' me noggin
And I've been, tryin' to tell myself to chill
But I find myself just takin' the wheel

She followed me to the bathroom, and I ain't have to pee
I'm at the club tryin' to do this little nasty freak
I met last week, you know the panties drop quick
She suck dick with two hands and a whole lotta spit
Average niggas get nervous around the bitch
Lick between her legs and run circles 'round her clit
Fall in love, she'll make your mind a wreck
When she lay on her back, and put her legs behind her neck
Sperm drinker, come in her mouth, she keeps suckin it
It's too sensitive, have a nigga sayin'
'Fuck this shit, bitch, can I have my dick back'
You don't wanna hit that, you don't wanna be inside that kit-cat
She's too nasty, but I like that
Pussy have you right back, fuck where your wife's at
It's hard for you to fight that

Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen
I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight 'cause the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle-game changed quicker than lighting
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife
I tried to give another nigga advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit 'cause this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two?
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid
Be one in your crew
I don't respect killas, I respect those with knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, catch your mental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It not your enemy who get you
It's always your own people
It's always your own people
It's always your own people
It's always your own people
It's always your own people

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
I be wondering, can I trust my friends?
'Cause they stab me in my back every time they can?
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With the loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons, in between us, came between us

I know you hate me, don't you
I bet you sitting, wishing my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well y'all see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggers start looking at me different than this
I'm down to play the real nigger shit to get with a bitch
But I'ma tell a motherfucker like this
You going good is what you come up against
Nigger you get what you get
So the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, weel I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggers know I
Don't believe in letting shit slid, nigger gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
The homeboy demeanor, but let the bullshit come between us
(T-Boz)
Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
I be wondering, can I trust my friends?
'Cause they stab me in my back every time they can?
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With the loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons, in between us, came between us"
64,In Cold Blood,2002,The Fix (2002),,Scarface,"(Scarface)
I started small time, dope game, pushin on the corner
Twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you want 'em
Full of formaldehyde, my clothes wreakin marijuana
Cops rollin' up on us, my neighborhood's like a sauna
Pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us
But if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
I ain't playin' no games, I'm on a mission fo' the change
Motherfuck bein a lame, I'm ten toes in the game - deep
I can't slip, this whole world want me sleep
See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin' for keeps, cause see, it's a thin red line
Between a nigga gettin' his, and me gettin' mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin' like it's my time
And anybody standin in the way of that is dyin'
I bust nine, how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me...
(Scarface)
One wrong move, and I'ma have to leave you for the goons
Catch you slippin asleep in your bedroom and then {*BLAM*}
Get you Audi, now what the fuck was this dude thinkin'?
You can cheat the rules of the streets, and not leave stinkin?
I can squeeze without blinkin, I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta
(Scarface)
I got a brick from a sucker that he wanted to move
But the whole while I'm cookin I'm like, ""Fuck this dude""
It's on, thirty-six zones of my own
Keep the money fo' myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone (ay) I just got knocked
And the cops was askin 'bout you, come get me hot
Never showed, so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme, steppin on the dough
It's cold, but that's it, I'm on it like I want it
And twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
That means I'm on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break 'em off a couple of C, and double up they fee
Takin' over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
And when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block
And if they wanna ride for they corners we ride right with 'em
Dummy move, whole thing, the goon squad get 'em
(Scarface)
No mo' petty rock hustlin, I'm in for the run
And I'm fo'sho I'm gon' be murdered for this shit that I done
But I'ma die standin up 'cause I'm a stand up nigga
Fuck dyin' like a bitch on my knees, I'm a killer
So don't nobody cry 'cause I was destined to get it
Just remember, I'm the one who took the dope game and flipped it
And pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
Of me seein first motherfuckin light of the day
A trigger man, deadly as fuck with a loaded AK
Spot my enemy and kill him the American way
I turned a dream into reality, with a fuck you mentality
Silencin all these niggaz in the neighborhood who challenged me
Family grievin from they loved one's mortality
He ain't got a reason to die then kill hi, it's a tragedy
Right?"

You wonder why,
I hang with these thugs
Whut,
I'm from the hood
Nigga,
I gives a fuck (I gives a fuck)
It's in my blood
Since I was little I been hangin' with these Niggas
And till I die I gon remain with these Niggas
St. Paul in
The M-P-L-S, I hear you callin'
I put it down yes
Now Chris Rock were you at
I heard you say some shit about some blacks
Nigga, this been your ass back
Come see the real deal
Stay in the fields Nigga
These Niggas will kill
This ain't no cap-gun shots, Nigga
This a Glock, pah, pah,
It's death on your block
Knock, knock
Whut's up Nigga?
These sirenes start singing
It's me and Yuk with the L-G in the makin'
It's stinkin', freakin'
Bowlin' on the weekend
Creepin', seekin'
Me, till the currency
Gimme stacks up on mo' stacks
I'm dubble parked for the train
Even your moms know my name
I be the D into the M and the M into the G
And I bring the B-O-M-B-?

It's In My Blood
Smokin' sweets, drink 40's to the suds
And fuckin' wit these thugs, Nigga
That's In My Blood
You wonder why us niggas be hustelers
And out there slingin' drugs, Nigga
That's In My Blood
That drug money, stuff that shit up under the rug
And make that Nigga bug, Nigga
It's In My Blood
Niggas like me turn Niggas like you into hustelers
Fuckin' wit us, fuckin' wit us!
(Yukmouth)
It's in my veins
Like a chain-reaction
How it all happened
Paps is slangin' crack in the mid 80's
Back in the day when shit was crackin'
Niggas pay 38 for a package
Tightly rappin'
For shippin' and handelin' taxes was added
That's where the A-raps headin'
Even when I sleep they in cavage
Lavage shit
Do automatics with scopes under my mattress
With the dope and the drugmoney,
Stuffin' that shit up under the rugmoney
Thug hungry
Takin' drugs only 'cause we love money
I'm a Nigga, he's a Nigga,
Would you like to be a Nigga too
Makin' big scrilla like these Niggas do
You probably be a drugdealer too
Scan and tuned in to the boys in blue
Listen for clues
In the kitchen bakin up Peruvian flake
It takes
28 grams
Multiplied by 36 zips to make
A triple beam brake, a triple beam shake
A hundred grams on the triple beam flake
2.2 pounds to be straight
My Niggas just flew in from GA
Ready to buy 4 kilos
Then drive slow back to Youngstown Ohio
So fuck these rhymes
Let me stick my dick in your ear,
And fuck with your mind
Nigga
(Big Mike)
Niggas betray themselves as low key,
Broken down and fabricated
Easily ejaculated, table with and half way faded
Ain't no wars 'cause they made it
That type of bullshit is outdated
But I played it like I laid it
My partners have always said that
It was set me up
For life
Money, clothes and hoes but road I chose was
Nothin' nice
Niggas know just what it's like to be hustelers
Governors from strugglers
Bitches lovin' us
Blindly chasin' that life we lust
I blush,
Bottles, havin' thoughts and iring dreams
Goin' down and roll fast
Tryin' to get what my eyes have seen
Fried of me, huh
Nigga for a hand that got me through these eyes right to see
But part not I was blind to the point,
Not even I could see, or that I could be
Obviously
I wasn't meant for me this type of trickery
Hit me with the type of mystery
Lay it down like history
With the intend of be myself and I
Street desire, easila
Piece of mind, I was least to find
Some sassiness
Hossisiless it gets to shit and praise to the farmer innercist
Nobody was meant for it, it was deadly
And I was discontent
With the shit that life once sent
Government depend, now most of my time is spent
Escapin' what I love
It's in my blood"
66,In My Time,2000,The Last of a Dying Breed (2000),,Scarface,"It was a cold morning, gloomy, sun barely shining
Figured it was gon rain today, so I'm in
Sit around the house until the thunder storms slacks off
Look at my nightstand, and pick the paper back up
Nostradamus, I'm readin chapter, after chapter
Predictions of the end of world, and after
Life, wit no beginning, as the world stops spinning
?As a journey that's never ending
I glance at my baby boy, I can see this in his eyes
The little nigga glad to be alive
And as the days go by, I thank god for watchin mines
Prayin' that I remained in fire
The same man that I was, which starts from the other mind phrase
Was it the cash I think my time came
For me to venture off into different demensions
The beginning, the endind, of my time
What we fail to realize
Is that we runnin' outta time
Do we ever be born again
In my time of dying
It's like I'm runnin' outta time
Will I ever be born again
In my time, I try to stay true steps on the game
And if you nigga's thinkin' like me, do the same
Which is one minute ya smilin', the next ya start cryin
'Cause we can't accept we born to die
And I, ease my edge, and be a nigga to the end
But it's more to life then me and my benz
When my mama told to speak to my friends
I kinda took that shit to heart
So don't fuck up your life, 'fore it starts
Some nigga's wanna be like Mike
I'd rather be like Christ (like Christ)
So at the end, I'll see bright lights (bright lights)
I save a prayer for the fallen soldier's
Too many nigga's died young, for tryna to hang
On the slaim's of our slums
And outcome, as mommy neals, sittin' on the front row
Hopin god will accept your soul
The new millienium, and as I sit watch the distance
Ships walk the horizon, I'll stare into space while I'm drivin'
And pray for me, all the ends of my sins
The beginning, the end, of my time, till I'm born again
In my time, I've seen life born, and I been blessed
Enough to see life lossed, it's just the price life cost
And shortly, explain my born, I know I'm born to do it wrong
So when I'm gone, life goes on
Tell my mother, when she on the front row, hold her head up
Shed no tears, and dred those years
Smile, and even though my whole life's been a po'ball
You did your's, and it's not your fault
Tell my grandmother those words too
She knows I'm headed to a better place
That'll put a smile on my wife's face
God's graced the evil spirit that surrounded me
And pass me, and anytime it could'a had me
But when it all went wrong, sung the same ol' song
Now it's peace after the storm blew on
And??, it's the better life, security for your's and mines
What the evil lies, and not so guide
In my time, it's been times, I would've stopped and called the quits
But I might as well sit until it's over wit
Eath to earth, and ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's the lord I trust
The territory where I come from, so I guess it'll be when I return
No sorrow, it was just my turn
And in those, last trumphet sounds, put me down in the ground
But I'll proably be at home by now
And it's help will change (these helps will be changed)
Blinking of a eye, but I don't think I'll get to see that
In my time, till I'm born again
(Scarface talking)
It's changed, when we born
And how we born from woman
We born, from the spirit, of life
And all our flesh remains
And not, by the flesh of man
And not by the flesh of man
Do not believe that
(Chorus until fade)"

It was the day that hell had broke loose, demons in the sky with the {?}
Take over the heavens and burn it over
It's darker than the hearts of men, but I ain't scared 'cause I'm a soldier
I walk with my weapon across my shoulder
Refuse to live, yet impossible for me to say I'd rather die
'Cause I'm a killer with the devil's eye (uh-huh)
I want the world to feel my heart, my heart, my set, my set
And these niggaz who contested me regret that
Poisonin my own breed to terminate yo' offerin
And may they die young and never live to cause {?}
I'm just wrapped up inside a homicidal mindstate
Destined to outrun the time it takes to catch fate
The day that shall come, that thou shalt be done
The day that I run till then I smile with the gun
Let off a shot and make the whole world hear it
Murder, I've written in blood, y'all fear it
As I walk through the valley of death I shall
Fear no man but God"

The ending, I'm the reaper, why you hiding
I'm violent I strike with the force of a bomb
And right when you least expect it I come
Uh, I know you see the fire in my eyes
The hunger the hate I'm trapped inside now die
Everybody in here gotta die, ain't nobody in here escapin my nine

Murder inc in the muthafucka like irv gotti

Raised like a machine, you suckas get blasted

It's been thirteen years and ain't went nowhere
Still, one of the coldest ever done this shit
And ain't no motherfucking question know who run this bitch
I got my nigga Erick Sermon he supplied the beat
And I be in the vocal booth, supply the heat
Up in the game, for the street, these blocks and thugs
With a pistol grip shotgun to box someone
And it's a thin red line between what was and ain't
Got a $50 sack, plus I love to drink
I be in southside nigga till it's said and done
And I was always taught to take the bread and run
Here it is, the motherfucking moment of truth
I came in one deep now what you hoes wanna do
All these Rolex watches
It ain't shit to me
And the Cristal poppin'
It ain't shit to me
Bitches out boppin
Ain't shit to me
It ain't shit to me, ain't shit to me
Man, hold up, got too much bleek in my truck
I silence niggas like gag orders
With motherfucking powderpuff I just add water
I blow you punk bitches out the frame
And I'ma make you hoes remember my name
I'm the J E S S E, J A M E S
I'm shuttin niggas down, H town is mine I bet you know now
So hush with the talk, talk
Claimin you gon' put it on the map
Well I done already done that
So follow in footsteps of the gangsta shit's finest
Since 1987, Mr. Scarface
Gosh, I'ma stop you at the moment of truth
The last man standin, now what you wanna do
So you got tight flows
It ain't shit to me
Money, hoes
It ain't shit to me
Brand new clothes
It ain't shit to me

It ain't shit to me
Build a house on the hill
It ain't shit to me
Brand new Benz, big wheels
It ain't shit to me, ain't shit to me, it ain't shit to me

Next time you mention southern rap remember the name
All you magazine niggas gettin' caught up in the new shit
Just remember what the truth is

Diary of a man made, nigga comin' agg'
The wall, the dead, lettin niggas know I ain't a prankster
Damn it feels good to be a gangster
Smile for me now, I see the man died today, my fuel
I'm still up in this bitch, what they wanna do
Ay, ay

All that talk it ain't shit to me

It's danger in the streets these days
Man how the fuck am I gon' keep me paid?
Believe me mayne; if I got to die I got to go
This was all never sure cause danger life I know
It was all about the diamond chains, or the ride and bank
Smoke and listen to the Isleys sang
Would I ride the same? Dawg, probably not
Laid back reminiscin on the times I shot
Dare all motherfuckers trippin' in them parkin lots
If it was war niggaz wanted it was war they got
I'm a nigga, a real nigga, a quick thanker
That would hesitate to aim and see the chamber
Discharge the cartridges that the hollow-point came from
You can hide but you cain't run
Yeah, and he just started what can not be stopped
And fucked up cause you were thinkin' you could not be got
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
This is not a game
Niggaz want a lifestyle with finer thangs
Hustlin to come up on these diamond chains, diamond rangs
Runnin' on the daily out here tryin' to slang
(Scarface)
Now analyzin all the wrong I've done
I'm surprised I ain't dead I guess the good die young
I put a hole in a nigga head, fuck why run
From a lazy motherfucker 'cause he flashed his gun
We ain't cut from the same shit, nigga I'm a shooter
If I show I got a pistol best believe I'ma shoot a
Stupid motherfucker down, shoot a motherfucker down
Chalk his ass in the dirt with a bullet in his mouth
And I won't lose sleep 'cause when it come time for me to pay the piper
Fuck it, I've been tryin' to meet
Yeah~! So please believe that when it's time to show
I'll be ready with my arms crossed, dyin' to go
And I won't shed tears, I'm respected here
And you won't hear things you'd expect to hear
I rejected fear; and I don't wanna be another second here
But the question is, is he lettin me live?
(Scarface)
Right here the pros and cons
Cause life's way deeper than the frozen arm
They might streetsweep you if you're holdin' on
My Sunday School teacher taught us Job in songs, another soul is gone
She couldn't have told me shit
Cause all I wanna do right here is fold me grip
And she talks to me in codes and all I know is bricks
Learn how to rock me up an O I coulda sold for six, instead she sold me tricks
So now I plead my case
The cops all on me tryin' to bleed my safe
My pops all on me tryin' to squeeze my face
But I'm not gon' squeal so I'ma need my space, back up I need my space
Momma ain't raised no rat
The word got back and niggaz paid for that
Yo' ass got served and never made it back
Your ass had birds a nigga laid you flat, and then he raid your stack
That's how the game is played"

There'll be no witnesses to this homicide
No re-enactment on the late night news to be re-dramatized
All you got is a nigga with a dot
In the middle of his muthafuckin head he been shot
Dropped in the middle of the floor and he ain't breathin
And the nigga's on the go 'cause we ain't seein
He did his dirt and got the fuck up out the picture
The hollow point just hitcha, out of line, so it got witcha
Call the muthafuckin helicopter
But ain't no hope, cause the Tina broke that nigga off a hella proper
That oughta hold your monkey ass (muthafucka, you)
That oughta teach your funky ass (muthafucka, you)

And lately I'm under a lot of pressure
It seems to me you can't come clean, so yo, I gots to check ya
I pull my .45 and (buck, buck, buck, buck)
And right before he die I (fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck)
I could give a muthafuck about the sentence
I snatch yo ass up off the hinges 'cause I'm (SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE)
Cause life has no meaning, no meaning
We were all born to die, so no screaming

Can't make me believe it
You a nice girl, but I'm a hood nigga on some street shit
And yeah, you know my weakness
Sucker for some love type
I come from the slums girl, you come from a good life
I wonder what you see in me
I love weed and Hennessy
You barely doing happy hour, I ain't never seen you drink
And now that's leaving me to think, how I got so close to you?
This was just a hit and split, that's what I supposed to do
One thing let up to the next, I'm addicted to your sex
You addicted to this dick, every cause has its effect
That's what I get I guess, I can't commit that's killing this
You gave me an ultimatum, I'm numb I ain't feeling shit
Must not know who she dealing with
Puddles on her pillow case, tears running, eyeline, lipstick smeared
Hey are you ok?
You disobey, you pay for that
Well, the love is gone, and she ain't made it back, pray for that
(Avant)
What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do

Think before you answer that, it's hard enough we breaking up
But after this no turning back, brought this on myself with her
Mistakes I'm forced to live with that, I'm knowing more mistakes to come
I'm human, that's my best excuse, in fact my only one
Tears fall, my kids call, 'This ain't me, it's his fault'
Oh shit no, we did this
A partnership with no room for forgiveness
I take the blame, take your aim
Shoot that shot, can't wait to claim
All of this, in Jesus name
Pray in church, they give you change
I feel your pain
Songs sung in the key of life, with no meaning right
Hopefully one day might come I'd see the light
Can't sleep at night
And I'm wondering who's fooling who?
I'm sure you know who's fucking me, 'cause I know who's been fucking you
We used to be inseparable, never thought that that day would come
Where I'd take that shit so serious, and you get so good at playing dumb, you got away with one

Lookin' me in my eyes, lyin', killing me with that soaking wet
Wouldn't let me meet your connect
Scratching me all across my face
Says she loves the way it feels when I'm in it all the way
60 calls a day, wondering where the fuck I'm at
Wondering where the fuck I stay, who else I fuck like that
Now let's be honest, you got him with whom you made your promise
And let us not forget, it's her with whom I made my woman
I know our days are numbered, enjoying moments after
Plus in lust we fell in love, the pains are more than laughter
Living our separate lives, are husbands reckless why?
Beneath the questions lie, why was she left to cry?
Should have left shit quiet, but you was out of line
Better step aside, gotta tell me why?
I was everything, you was all I had
Now this is change, and then this change is bad
Make a note of that
(Avant)
What happened to us, you acting foolish
I'm acting foolish, what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, we're going through it
This shit confusin', what we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what we need to do
Before something happens we better keep it movin'"
74,Keep Me Down,2002,The Fix (2002),,Scarface,"This song is about a nigga always trying to keep you down. you know you got to
Touch that
We made something from nothing
And vowed to never tear it apart
We turned the street hustle into an art
That would quickly change life forever for us
No more riding bikes or catching the bus
We on the roll up, money to fold up
With cognac and cooked yola
Got the neighborhood about to blow up, but hold up
I see this van sittin', this old cat in a fitted
Trying to get your little homey tore up
Yo bruh, we ain't working on this corner take your ass on, dog
'Fore you make me feed your ass to my hogs you fucking faggot
I know you want to catch me with this bag so you can hide me
Or with my 44 so you can 45 me
You put this shit off in our neighborhoods and sweat us
And when you finally catch us up you give us letters
A cold thing
Just when a nigga reach his gold man
You hand him a case for easing out the dope game
And I'm...
Watching us unfold with the times
He don't really want a nigga to climb
You'd rather separate me from my family forever
Instead of trying to keep us together
You motherfuckers would rather keep me down...
So what I rap about these streets
That don't make me be no less of a man
Than a person that do work with his hands
It's bad enough I gots to deal with all these pressures that stand You tryin'
To make me stray away from my plan
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm from the gutter, where all we had was one another
No wheat bread to butter, from one bed to the other
All uncles and no brother
My mother's at work
My grandfather was my dad
And when he died it hurt
And as I hold back the tears my eye-wells swell
I been praying for heaven, I been living in hell
And these niggas in my age group is dead or either locked up
The bitches no better, they smoked out or knocked up
But I still love my hood, that's where it started
Ain't no hard feelings, we partners nigga, regardless
That's why you always see me coming around
'Cause I could never turn my back on my town
But still I'm...
Money never changed me
Money changed the people around
Now they plot to try to keep me down
But still I rise like yeast
Your whole conversation 'bout B
Fuck a nigga talking 'bout me, I'm a G
The realest motherfucker ever done it
You can't continue to pimp me and y'all eat from it
So fuck every soul who ever felt like I owed
Them a god damn dime, or a god damn rhyme or a god damn chance
Motherfucker you sad
You a grown ass man, holding a nigga hand
Now get out on your own, stop depending on your homes
To chuck you a bone, and stop throwing stones
And that goes for everybody thinking it's them
Fuck you, you and you,
Her, him and him
Tom, Dick and Kim
All of y'all stand accused
Saying fuck to me
And I done bought your children's shoes
I'm..."

(K.B.)
As I proceed to give your ass what ya need
A straight guerilla, that hit these niggas for the scrilla
The wig spliter, I cock this 44 revolver, the problem solver
Step and get wet, like saliva
Like Pearl Harbor, I bomb muthafuckas
Got a whole army, so bring it on muthafuckas
You gets no ends, fuckin' with interface, nigga
Your facin death, 'cause it's a whole clique of killas
And cap peelas, niggas that don't give a fuck about they damn self
You'll get your ass heated up, beat a nigga blue
And now we wanna get his crew, I take his whole crew
And I go through 'em like the flu
I finish niggas
Got more Clan than Menace niggas
I pull triggas, bring the pain to bitch niggas
And terrorize, and I could see it in they eyes
I capitalize, when it's down to Krunch Time, it's Krunch Time
(K.B.)
Hoe's phase 'em all
'Cause I'm Mac like Mall
But fuck a brawl, I beat a bitch to my hall
Country is hell, straight from the land of ATL
Got a gang of dope, except I sell it from the shelf
A million sells, and now these muthafuckas jealous
Schemein and plottin, and then they asses smell rotten
Lost and forgotten, they shoulda known there ain't no stoppin'
Niggas be floppin, releasin shit when I be droppin'
Some try to copy, bullshit be sounding sloppy
But they can't get me, them niggas suck like a hickey
The rhyme sender, drop your shit and surrender
You're no contender, make niggas Fall like November
In the fuckin' rumble, you'll see the biggest nigga crumble
Tryin' to tumble, I make the widest nigga humble
Big as Mutumbo, stepped away for 44
Your ass is dying, goddamit, in Krunch Time, it's Krunch Time
(K.B.)
I hope now you see, that can't nobody fuck with me
In this industry and in the F-a-c-e
The fuckin' label, with straight guerillas in the stable
Hit ya like Cable, ain't no muthafuckas able to stop my crew
Interface run shit, and if you niggas can't recognize
Your ass die quick
Bitch, you're askin to catch a casket
I'm so drastic, pullin the trigger back like elastic
And blasted your whole area, hoe I bury ya
For layin your mouth ahead of ya
I'm the predator, and you the prey
Nigga watch what you say, I keep this AK
So muthafucka make my day
There's no escapin from this full blooded ape and
You made a mistake-in, and now the beast has awakened
Time to take your life, nigga
You shoulda thought twice
Now your ass is mine, muthafucka, in Krunch Time, it's Krunch Time"

It's jumpin' off in H-Town, baby
He-he-he
Strictly for the funk lovers, give it to me
And we really want the whole world to see
How it goes...
We want your mind to blow, baby
...When you free your mind and let it float
Let me roooooooooooooll...
We want your mind to blooooow
Just let us hang with you
Hangin' in the hood, just shootin the breeze
My partners on the cut smokin' swisher sweets
Trippin' on the hoochies rollin' by in they rides
Guzzlin up a forty ounce of cold St. Ides
Jammin to a tape to my partner had made
'Growin' up in the Hood' bein mixed with Face
Swisher sweet's a killer, feelin' nothin' but nice
Reached in my pocket for the old school dice
Pulled out a knot and dropped the dice on the flo'
And asked my partner Mike what they hittin fo'
Pulled out a yard and said, ""We bettin a dove""
Tee Lee Baby, show your partner some love
Kickin back fadin, put the flame to the joint
3-2, drop baby, 3-2's your point
Back in the do' with a fo' and a ace
Picked up his ends and waved the dice in my face
And then he hollered out ""School house!""
Schooled 'em again, now d's come in ounce
And walked away from the crap game broke
But it ain't no thing, yo - just let a brother smoke
Let me roooooooooooooll...
We want your mind to blooooow
Just got some things to do
Back on the creep after losin some change
Seen my partner [Name], Big Chief and James
Creepin' on the boulevard, actin' a fool
Trippin' on the broads at the old school
Music bumpin hard, never turnin' it down
Trunk super tight with surround-by sound
Paint job crackin' cause the punch ain't fade
Jammin that brand new 2Low tape
Windows all smokey, blowin' coke-laced seed
I'm throwin' up the deuce to the HPD
Now they lookin' crazy like I sold the hay
Just another day in the heart of S.A.
Roll a little further there, I seen O.G.
With his brother named [Name], S.A. O.G.
They chopped up the hood, so I'm chunkin it back
And then they pulled out a $200 sack
When I saw it I almost choked
Twist your partner one, big baby, just let your partner smoke
Let me roooooooooooooll...
We want your mind to blooooow
We got some things to do
Smokin' on some lovely, now I'm feelin' fine
It's jumpin' off at the 9.9
5th Ward in the house with the S.A. fools
Ain't no set trippin' 'cause we all so cool
Drinkin' up the bottle, gettin' drunk as a skunk
That 151 just ain't no punk
Hit the stage and grabbed the mic and started flexin styles
A stage full of tight MC's goin' buckwild
Now throw your hands in the air like that
On the wheels of steel is my homie Lonnie Mack
Gettin' down on his own
Now I'm finna pass my partner Jay the microphone

Throw your hands in the air like that

77,Lettin' Em Know,1993,The World Is Yours (1993),,Scarface,"Yeah nigga
Back in this muthafucka once again
I'm just lettin a nigga know
You know
S.A. and 5th Ward forever, fool
Niggas watch your back cause here I come again
Rappin' funky shit for the 199-trey
In 1989 I sold dope for a pastime
1991 they called that nigga Scarface
Started on the team when a nigga turned 16
Stackin that green sellin dope to the dopefiends
Daddy seen a scheme, thou so it seem
'Cause he hooked a nigga up with a nickel-plated triple beam
Had a lotta game with the beam, that's what it came with
Taught a nigga how to get to funk when it jump
If static jumped off, then I was down for the dirt
When puttin' in work I ain't no muthafuckin punk
Down with my partners that a nigga fucked around with
Huntin for some shit to get up into and we found it
If you had a problem with a nigga we was down with
We rolled by your set and shot your whole click down, bitch
Niggas play for keeps in the city that I come from
Niggas talk shit from out of town, but they don't want none
If you think you want some, then go ahead and come
It ain't where you at, you stupid bitch, it's where you from
And comin' through my hood is where you findin all the thugs at
Lookin' for some dope and they gon' show you where the drugs at
Lookin' for some trouble, well, a nigga's gonna plug that
Niggas keep they pistols up underneath they rug mat
Show your little ass, go ahead and let your ass show
Talkin' that shit, punk bitch, you better dash, hoe
Once I get it on it ain't no muthafuckin holdin' this
Kinda fucked up that I'm a nigga that be chauvinist
Niggaroe, the heater want this fool to let the trigger go
But bitch, I gots to give you one to let you niggas know
I'm lettin you bitches know
Front, back and side to side
I'm lettin you bitches know
How a nigga back in the game I used to start shit
Moppin up the hood, makin' muthafuckas squab
You fucked with one nigga out of the muthafuckin click
You had to fuck around with the whole fuckin' mob
Cause niggas rolled thick and they didn't take shit
Quick to put that ass up in a muthafuckin lynch
Whip it on your ass, then tie it up to a fence
And since we began it's been that way ever since
My niggas used to kick it up around the fuckin' pikes
Smokin' swisher sweets, drinkin' Miller Lites
Takin' turns heatin up the muthafuckin mic
And maybe beat a buster out his muthafuckin bike
Crackerjacks kept a muthafucka on the hustle
Makin' sure my business stayed stead' trump tight
Hoes sell flippers, gave two for ten
And even gave up shake to keep my clientele tight
Before long I had customers out the ass buyin flippers
Bearskin coats, tight ropes and fat slippers
Fresh fade daily, I had my own fuckin' clipppers
And all kinds of hoes on my cocksuckin zipper
Hoes came in handy, but my money came first
Causebitches get aghost when they see a nigga's hearse
So if I ain't have shit I had a muthafuckin ???
And could pull on my dick if worse came to worst
So if you got a problem with the way I run my business
Let a nigga know, so I can put you in your place
9 times out of 10 you ain't man enough to deal with
The born killin', dope dealin' Mr. Scarface
Rougher than a muthafucka, takin' no shit from a
Busta muthafucka who be flexin off the bullshit
Got my bull pump on all you bitch-made niggas
So let a nigga know when you bitches wanna flip
I'm lettin you niggas know
Front, back and side to side
I had to let you know I ain't that nigga you should toy with
So don't come in my face with that muthafuckin boy shit
Never comin' soft with that 'love, peace and joy' shit
Mr., Mr. Scarface, the real deal McCoy shit
Sendin out a shot to all you busta-ass one times
Suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
Cause you don't get props for what you doin' for the cops
Except a swift kick and a mouth full of dick
Lettin muthafuckas talk ass about your gameplan
Just because you got a big gat you'se the same man
That used to get your ass kicked daily back in the neighborhood
Finally got a nigga back pushed like you said you would
Fuck it, I'm a nigga gettin' down for his cash flow
Down to down a hoe, I'm lettin you niggas know
I'm lettin you bitches know
Front, back and side to side
I'm lettin you niggas know
You know I'm sayin'?
This is for the
Front, back and side to side
Sendin this out to all my muthafuckin partners"
78,Look Into My Eyes,2000,The Last of a Dying Breed (2000),,Scarface,"(Scarface)
Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see
Do you think I'm cra-zy??? (AAAAAGHHH! Just bein me)
Sometimes I wanna die, maybe I'll be free
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin me
(I can feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed
Look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes)
And tell me what you see (and tell me what you see)
Can you see my future, and what lies down the line?
Is it just my test, or is it just my time?
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did
I forgot to be picked off, when I was just a kid
A poison in my mind, tryin' to find relief
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin me
Tryin' to set me up, bustin' down my streets
Blockin' up my door, to see if he can catch me
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what niggas say
Fuck Ronnie Carbone (?), and fuck the D.E.A.
And fuck these undercovers, that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese
And I ain't finna snitch, 'cause I don't know a thang
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane
I know you crackrs pissed off, I can see it in your eyes
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die
(Until the day that I die)
So fuck you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie
You just wanna destroy me, just like you did my guy
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth
Listen up my niggaz: ""The F.B.I. been watchin' you""
Especially if you black, and tryin' to leave the streets
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin' me
Runnin' in my crib, makin' niggaz lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed
But not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me?
Look me in my eyes!
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?(My eyes!)
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee?
(Scarface)
Look me in my eyes, I've told all I could tell you
And now you know too much, if you leak a word I'll kill you
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged?
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain
What's up with all these nightmares, this long rewinding road
That leads me to the same place I started from;
Right before I left home
(Look me in my eyes!) I thought you was a shrink
Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think
OK your time is up, now analyze my life
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes
(Look me in my eyes, my eyes)
You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations, when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers, I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes
Looked me in my eyes"
79,Ma Homiez,1998,My Homies (1998),,Scarface,"(Scarface)
(Bring it back)
I bring it back with all my old school game
No matter how you hate the OG, you can't change him
See, cause to me it's total disrespect
For motherfuckers who done lived in the ghetto
Turn around and talk they shit
And try to downgrade the next dude tryin'
To get up out the ghetto like you
But you straight fried him
See, now what you niggas need is open eyes
Although you made yourself a couple a million, you keep an open mind
Cause down the stretch, you lose your grips on reality
And he who grips, slip on life fades fatality
I seen the same shit you seen in the 70's
And you can blame shit on me, but nigga never
Beat the flow of a youngster, raised up amongsta
Niggas who ain't bullshit with life, they straight stuck ya
Now how the fuck am I supposed to change
A place that since my mother been born it ain't been known to change
And all my niggas can relate to what I bring to 'em
Instead of turnin' my back, I sing to 'em
Jockin my homies?
Ride for my homies, think?
'Cause I'll die for my homies
(Scarface)
Dedicated to my homies who been trapped in the jail
Since these other motherfuckers seem to lost they respect
For the place, niggas got game on how to handle these streets
Instead of layin dead, you get knocked down you stand on your feet
If I ain't learn nothing else, I learned to struggle and strive
Cause the ghetto made a man out a nigga, I can't lie
But every black community done seen the same thing
Somebody come up out the hood and make a strange change
Ain't no forgettin where it started for me
The hustle out the hood never departed from me
No matter how many niggas try to change my story
Can't nobody make me go change my story
So motherfuckers claimin that they represent life
Make sure them hoes is representin it right
Talk to me
Now break it down to the beat one time
(Vocal breakdown)
Talk to me now
(Scarface)
How dare you so called black politicians
Knock me for the game that I explain to my listeners
See, they wanna put me on remote control
So they can turn me on and off when they feel it
And try to take control
But I refuse to cooperate
You take away the plug out the game it ain't gon operate
So now we're picky with the wickedly ways
And I done been inside the beast in his belly for six days
'Cause they solutions is institutionalize
All the game made millionaires would choose to survive
Instead of fallin' dead, we bounce to these beats
But you look at my music like an ounce on these streets
I send this out to every street in your city with blacks on em
Since every motherfucker got paid to turn they backs on em
I got more love for the ghetto than that
And every time I step my ass out the hood, I go back
So you can miss me with that bullshit you stressin
I keep it real with my niggas with no question
So while you're teachin 'em that shit they can fake to
I teach 'em shit that they can relate to
My homies"

(VERSE 1: Scarface)
Is this how you made it, or is this sickness out of control
Is the beginning of the end right now? Let me know
Do the saved souls travel the road of the souls lost?
How come the dead can't talk?
Through horrified eyes I can picture the other side
And though my heart shed tears outside I couldn't cry
Watched my homeboy die, day by day body tired
Remember, I finally accounted before he expired
They tell me there's a peaceful place, I wanna see it
They say I gotta leave it to see it, so it be it
And though I appreciate bein alive
Sometimes I wanna see how it feels to just die
Come back and tell my story to the ones who really know me
Converse with the angels and elders that went before me
And satisfy the hunger for those who wanna know
If there's life after death, and if so, where we go
I often find myself involved in deep thought
I wanna see is heavens a place like we thought
And Christian science seems to think it's just a mindstate
But before I put my trust in a man I'll just wait
Or better yet, I take the journey for myself
Put a bullet in my own head, it's my death
So when twelve o'clock jump on eve of 11/9
(*Gunshot*) suicide
Just as I thought, a bright light
Greeted by friends and family, so life-like
Black and in between screams and then peace
Lookin' in the eyes of the grieved and deceased
Father pleace, send me back, I don't wanna die
I'm not as strong as I was and I can't lie
And during all the mayhem somehow I remained calm
And I woke up singing this song
I been a pawn and I been a king
And I been down since the beckoning
I try to look beyond the sight of sound
And the lights come from the underground
Rarely got questions but I found myself somewhat astound
And through my quest for the answers, know what I found?
I found that regardless to what people say
The shooters gotta do it day for day
So make your peace
(VERSE 2: Scarface)
Open your books to the first chapter, verse four, page eight
And link to my thoughts as my intents are to initiate
And enter the minds of the ones who are blind
And shed light to all the mankind written in rhyme
I preach to each to get off your ass, stand on your feet
Cause everyday it's niggas lyin' dead in the street
We stuck in our ways, it's different now than back in the days
Fuck what they say, cause ain't no comin' back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
I had a dream and seen a double sun, a different world was in the makin'
The ruler of this new world was Satan
The sky turned blood-red, the silent trumpet started playin'
Then I woke up, my imagination
Runnin' wild but then again the coming of Christ
Could be the moment of any minute, now or tonight
So make your peace, cause 666 is the mark of the beast
It's dark in these streets
And some might see it hard to believe but God is in me
And yeah, though I walk through the valley of the wickedness
I know I'm protected 'cause I'm convicted
Anybody believin in the Big Bang Theory
And thinkin' that thyself is the God, you need to hear me
How do you explain
The skies, the moon, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea
The Earth without form facing the deep
Darkness and challengin the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds
Didn't make up the trees, so why we turn our backs on the truth?
This heaven and hell part we seem to hide from the youth
I'm tellin' what few tongues of the evil will despise
My intention's to revitalize, still I revive
And I've read the Books, and I heard the lessons
And I'm on my knees steady stressin
You make your peace"

""King of Da Ghetto,"" whassup 'Face, big homey
I greet the Father on my knees, with a bowed head and humbled heart
My conversation is have mercy on me please
I just wanna be happy will it come to pass
Fresh out of my mind, been 27 years and every day I've seen is sad
Even though I've tried till I've cried I can't even stand
Feels like I've died a thousand times but just can't make it man
Ain't nuttin different about me doin' dirt
Except I've never crept up on a come up maybe that's why the hustlin hurts
I remember just like it was yesterday I'm 16
Can't find no love can't find no peace I wonder what it means
Could it be because I didn't choose the devil all the time
I became an outcast to the hood, restricted to my rhyme
Where I could not just live my life without my talent makin' danger
Jealousy is now state jail from friends that turned to strangers
They hate me, I don't understand why
I swear I never seen a man cry, till it was my own eye
(Z-Ro)
I'm 21 and think I finally got a grip on life
And how bills pay the apartment, a step-son and a step-wife
But without a vehicle it's kinda hard to get around
If I got weed I ride for free if not my partners let me down
So now I'm livin' to be one deep so much I'm hatin' people
Lookin' at everybody, even babies like they Satan people
Nobody understand me, everybody's trippin' with me
Wonder why when I gotta ride when none of my people flippin with me
Too many haters tryin' to take a player off his game
Not tryin' to be ballerific, I'm just tryin' to have some thangs
They're just like crabs in a bucket, these people pull me down
If I didn't have so many obstacles think where I could be now
On MTV or BET or in some magazine
Instead I'm stressin, hooked on codeine, headed to tragedy
Sometimes I think it's better just to die
Because I never seen a man cry, till it was my own eye
(Z-Ro)
(What's happenin' now)
In the year two thousand (six) ain't nothin' changed for Ro
12 albums strong, lookin' for dough and yet I'm still po'
Now I done had and I done lost and I done had again
On the verge of suicide, I deeply wish I had a friend
But even still a good samaritan is Z-Ro's way
And with that Christian attitude I caught a homeboy case
I done took too many blows, a punchin bag is how I feel
The deep depression starts to set, sanity's outta here
I start my mission tryin' to find my fate
CDC #4 in name I'm feelin' oh-so-helpless in this place
I want revenge it's heavy on my mind but ain't central
Say don't fight evil with evil, try to relax and do yo' time
I heard a voice say there wasn't no need in actin' up
Realized I wasn't at peace with God and had to patch it up
Hopin that blessings fall out of the sky
Z-Ro ain't never seen a man cry until it was his own eye"

Coming up out ya
And every now and then I can't help but to think about ya
Hatin' that we ended like this, but I had ya beefin'
I knew what that was missin' wondering, and I need ya
More now then I ever did, put in my heart for ya
Starin' at my eyes they ain't shot, wide open
Gotta love forming in my life, for another day
And I thank you for some other doing, just let em' pray
(Scarface whispering)
-Just the only thing, I need Mary
-Sssssshh!, I just need Mary
Had me thinkin'
She was the only I'd ever needed
Stick in ground, runnin' round, like oh... never need her
I remember seeing cancer sticks, and smellin' inscents
The intimate, and couch, hoping it's soak sex
And niggas so thick, I had to call her up the same night
Dang, they said the number still is the same
Wouldn't let my friends kill her
Take ya penetentiary chances to be with her, go deep with her
Cheif with her, sprung on the number lawn braud
Once she get you hot in her clutches, you can't run
In the dark, hearing footsteps, and you can't sleep
You find yourself so in love with this bitch, that you can't eat
Paranoia, that's a feeling so scarce (so scarce)
This bitch almost made me need Mary
(Scarface whispering)
-I'm the first one to tell you I need Mary
-Shit, I need Mary
Mary, been home sick, I gotta see her
And when I finally hit you this time, I'd never leave ya
Took ya love for granite, I was blind
And I'm hoping you can accept my apology, for this one last time
You can tell that I ain't had her, 'cause I can't control her
This hasheesh, Mary I love, just like I told ya
I'm sensitive as I write you this letter, so listen to it
Seeing if you'd be down for a threesome
...Mary
(Scarface whispering)
-I'm the first to ever tell you I need Mary
-I'm the first to ever tell you I need Mary
-Man I tell ya, I need Mary"
83,Mary Jane,1997,The Untouchable (1997),,Scarface,"(Scarface whispering:)
I don't really remember feeling like this
Got this love formin' in my life - from this dame
And indeed took the form of life - it's a shame
How a man can fall in love with dreams - not afraid
Not afraid to let you up and leave
Do your thang MaryJane mess with all my folks - got 'em high
For the days that they were lost and broke - shit got 'em by
Only right was stopping it from props
Plus she from the block of only finer crops
Do your thang MaryJane

Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
Do your than MaryJane

When the world starts to stress you out - what you do?
Put a cancer stick up in your mouth - or grab a brew
Sold in stores but the fact remains is - they the blame
And the government's been taxin' that () - gettin' paid
If it's taxable it's cool to smoke - kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks - true or not
Other people try to make you bad--but I know you not
When my situation's lookin' sad I know I got
A true friend in my time of need - all I need
Your natural you come from seeds - I decree
Makes me happy when I'm feelin' pain
Once again makes me happy just to hear your name
Do your thang MaryJane
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
MaryJane do your thang
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary

When you sad depressed and feeling strange - who you blame
Need some company to keep you sane - call her name
MaryJane I love you MaryJane - do your thang
You're all I need to get me through this thang - true to game
You ain't never made me stash my thang - scratch the brain
Anything you've always kept me tame - and its plain
For me to see that you my everything - MaryJane
MaryJane helps to ease the brain - when you hang
Through the seasons you ain't never change - stayed the same
Never seen what people seen in speed - you became
Naturally you everything we need - do the thang
Do your thang baby true indeed

84,Mind Playin' Tricks 94,1994,The Diary (1994),,Scarface,"I sit alone in my four cornered room starin' at candles.
Are we on the radio dukes?
Awww yeah, give it to me.
Yeah.
At night I can't sleep, I'm tossin' and turnin'
I still got the candlesticks burnin'
It ain't changed but it's a different time
And I'm still playin' tricks with my mind
My mother's always stressin' that I'm livin' wrong
But I got my 
'cause I'm gettin' grown
And their lookin' at your little boys success
And I been thinkin', I'm dealin' with too much stress
So I stay up on my 
And watch out for the g's and fools
'Cause the homies that I thought I had
See me stackin' up a grip, and they just started talkin' bad
So I stay away from outsiders
And when I roll through, it makes 'em open they mouth wider
I used to think that you was my one and only homie
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me
Yeah
Dear diary I'm havin' a little trouble with my mind state
How many bullets would it take to change my mind? wait
Sometimes I want to end it but I don't though
They tell me see my pastor but I don't go
'Cause they all be on this one street
So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
And give my money to the most needy
And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
'Cause their puttin' a price tag on a man's word
And it's a fashion show, so the men flirt
The world is endin' so they try to make us switch fast
And they openin' up these churches for some quick cash
And usin' the money fo' they new cribs
While Brother Johnson just got kicked out where he lived
I follow no man, 'cause man be phoney
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't seem to keep my mind on a steady track
I'm all about gettin' mine so I study that
But it seems they want to get me
So I try to keep my 
 me
Just in case they want to see a homies head blown
But I got to stay around to see my kids grown
I finally found a woman who could deal wit me
Back then I had a woman who wouldn't real wit me
And now she's back with her old lady
And now I got it goin' on and they sure hate me
Now I'm a gone and she's alone
Hahahaha, her mind was playin' tricks on her
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
Bringin' it back like this here
1-9-9-1 all the way to the 1-9-9-4 and they me face.
Yeah.
My mind was playin' tricks on me"

Never goin' back 'cause I got
Money and the power
(Scarface)
Deep in the heart of South Park lurks a stalker
S.A. fool, native Houston South Parker
Born and brought up to be a heartless motherfucker
No one else to blame, fuck it blame it on my mother
When I was growin' up nobody seemed to give a shit
And that's what makes me one hard son of a bitch
Since they ain't give a shit, I ain't give a shit either
Sweet 16, time to stack me up some ki's
Learned the game of hustlin, fuckin' dopefienders
Sellin niggaz beat, in other words amphetamines
My game was more advanced, sellin speed I'm goin' broke
Got 'em up with Floyd and Floyd had fronted me some dope
Learned to rock it up, now I got it sold
Time to go for broke, motherfuck who I owe
Business started boomin, started movin powder
Motherfuck the bitches I want money and the power... yup!
Chorus: Scarface
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin' short I got the
Money and the power
Yup!
Money and the power, money and the power
Bitches on my dick 'cause I got
Money and the power
(Scarface)
Bought me a Caddy, 30's and vogues
Brand new crib, brand new clothes
Mom would ask questions, and often pitch a bitch
Where am I gettin' the money? Mickey D's ain't paid me shit
I'd make up a story, just to get her off my back
Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack
Everything was smooth, exactly how I played it
A dollar to be made, best believe a nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties, and sixty cent bumps
Nigga rollin' hard, stackin paper like Trump
And I ain't give a fuck I told you that from the jump
Didn't worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump
Ass out of line, word 'em up a nigga sprayed em
Momma told me shoot first, and ask questions later...
Six hundred bucks a motherfuckin hour
And I ain't fallin' short 'cause I got money and the power, yup
Chorus: Scarface
Money and the power, money and the power
I ain't fallin' short I got the
Money and the power

Money and the power, money and the power
I got it like dat, 'cause I got
Money and the power
(Scarface)
There goes 21, and still stackin 30's
Brought my brother Warren Lee down from New Jersey
He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up
Said fuck gettin' paid, I guess my brother'd rather fuck
Bitches ran his life, and they're still runnin' Lee
I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin' me
It really doesn't matter, cause Ac'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin' funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers, to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggaz stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggaz up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will
Come to find out, they wasn't fuckin' with my boys
Busted a nigga who said he paid em, talkin' noise
Hehehehehe... I guess the juices are sour
But I ain't fallin' short 'cause I got money and the power YUP!
Chorus: Scarface
Money and the power, money and the power
Sold a million records I got
Money and the power
Yup!

Best to come clean, 'cause I got

87,Mr. Scarface,1991,Mr. Scarface Is Back (1991),,Scarface,"Mr. Mr. Scarface from walking down the block
Out jumps some fiends and steals all his rocks
Pulls out a gun and shoots down all the fiends
And Mr. Mr. Scarface went up the block again
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have, all I have, all I have in this world)
Ah yeah, hah
Mr. Scarface is back in the motherfuckin house once again!
Yeah, droppin' some of that new
Mr. Scarface Two, on your motherfuckin ass
So suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
Or something, bitch
Verse One:
I don't give a FUCK about the chatter in the background
Niggaz get beat when they step this is axe down
If you don't know, I recommend you check
And ask them motherfuckers, how many heads I put to rest
I play a game but the game ain't roulette
Slangin cane is the thang and I beat
That there's a lot of wannabe Scarfaces
I've heard the name in ninety-nine different places
I'm here to squash it all original will speak
Scarface on your ass from the streets
I left my cut, in fear of a prison term
They wanna put me in a chair and let me burn
But go to prison on a murder rap, fuck that
I refuse to be a visitor in state's camp
So I broke and left behind all I worked for
Either that or be sentenced for a drug war
And many want to know why I've slowed up
It's either that or get fucked
Cause laws get happy on the trigger
Say fuck it put a cap in a nigga
But this ass ain't made for no caps homey
This ass says 'Exit Only'
So I get in the wind but hey
A nigga still sold a quarter everyday
I sat around for six months black
Waitin for the day to make a comeback
And now I'm ready for combat
Mr. Scarface is back
Chorus: repeat 2X
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have, all I have, all I have in this world)
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the farilla my nigga just call me Scarface
Verse Two:
Aiyyo Bido, drop that shit
Yeah, heh heh
Back in the South Park, six o'clock on the dot
Checkin' on my old rock spot
I seen the same old set
Heh, the small timers see me so they jet
Buildin one-twenty-eight
I got myself a bag and I can't wait
To cut 'em up small to make a profit
Niggaz on the cut short stop it
Fiends'll see 'em small then they go
Where, to see the motherfuckin pro
One nigga got pissed
And started reachin' for his shit
Three-fifty-seven on your ass fool
Like I said before, you don't get a second chance dude
Unloaded on his ass he was hurt
Six shots put his dick in the dirt
Laid him out like a motherfuckin rug
Gettin' pumped full of thirty-eight slugs
Some other niggaz stepped out y'all
Aww shit, I had to make a phone call
Hello?
Hay Jay
Whassup?
I'm in a little trouble man
Where you at?
I'm out here in South Park Village
Stay right there, I'll be right on
C'mon let's take these motherfucers to war main
Jay called up some niggaz from the 5th Ward
And came back with a motherfuckin hit squad
Motherfuckin uzi machine
Big Chief packed an M-16
Will and AK with a banana clip
And little Bill had a god damn pistol grip
I hit a little laugh and got me a buzz
And that's about the time they got drugged
One more war took place
You can call me the shit started, or call me Mr. Scarface
Verse Three:
Damn, check this shit out
Later on, all alone, you know what happened next
Another bitch came by to give me sex
It was kind of strange I was thrown off
The last bitch got her head blown off
But fuck I ain'tsta pass up no pooty
She started strippin at the door, oh goody
I got in that ass with the quickness
Fuckin' her down with the diznick
I didn't have to pretend I loved her
All she wanted me to do was just fuck her
So I gave it up to the lady
And all she said was 'Fuck me baby, fuck me baby'
I started stroking in an outrage
The whole while I was starin' at my twelve gauge
The bitch was makin' noise I said I'm killin' her
And all the while my dick was hard and he was still in her
I made a nut as she fell to the floor
I heard a knock on the front door
I grabbed the twelve gauge from the bed head
Who is it? (Fred) Who?
Who the fuck is Fred, I stood by the door
By that time someone jumped in the window
Now what the fuck was I do? *bam bam bam*
The bitch packed a twenty-two
Hit him in his head, there she laid him
The nigga standin by the door I sprayed him *automatic fires*
And headed for the back
I seen that same old brown cadillac
It kinda fucked me up at first
Cause the nigga that drove that caddy rode away in a hearse
I opened up fire on the ride G
Who I was shootin for was standin right behind me
I had a double barrel pointed at my ass
Could this be the end of Mr. Brad?
I don't know what happened to the slut
Well that's about the time the closet door it opened up
*Kicked open* On your ass trick!
I'll be damned if I go out like the last bitch!
Heh, five-oh's on my ass main
They know me by the face, but they don't know my last name
Now I'm back on the case
Yeah, just call me Mr. Scarface"

Hey
Shit
Yeah nigga, that's
That - that - that
This - this is some - ehm
What we gon' call this one here?
Fuck it
Let's call it - ehm
Some - some
Some old school Scarface freestylin
Youknowmsayin?
Yeah
Ah shit!
I'm finna freestyle in this bitch
He-yeah
Huh youknowmsayin?
Check it out
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Pushin rocks on the block, I'm never broke, mayn
But now I'm up against some mo' shit
Because the five-o's done jumped in my face with some hoe shit
Tried to mix a nigga up in a homicide
Said I shot a muthafucka in his mama's ride
I ain't the nigga in the trench coat
I don't push rocks on the block, I deal the big dope
I ain't the nigga on the mic that done said he quit
But I be damned if I get popped for some petty shit
That's why I move the real chickens
So if I'm goin' down, I'm comin' home on a meal ticket
Cause in this game you can't bar shit
Do your dirt on the cool, so they can't say they saw shit
So when them muthafuckas step up with that he-say
You can tell 'em hoes to hit the freeway
'Cause I ain't touchin shit with my own hands
I leave the dirt to be done by the next man
And count my money when they push it off
I wonder if the dope game is still bein good to y'all
Cause in the past four years, yo
I done clocked more cash sellin dope than them white folks
That's the reason why they upset
And always tryin' to mix a nigga up in some fuck shit
But I'm a killer comin' atcha
Mr. Scarface Part III, nigga, The Final Chapter
He-he-he
Just freestylin in the studio, though
Where is Scarface?

(Here I am
Here I am)
How much do you make, Sir?
(I don't -
Man, what the fuck is you talkin' bout how much I make?!)
Ha-ha-ha...
(Fuck you!)
I'm in the South Park, peepin out the territory
Finna set up shop just like in every story
So I'm rentin out the backside
And let them niggas do they work, and me, I'm kickin back, right?
And layin low in the next section
Got a fully automatic M-11 for my protection
Everything is goin' smooth as planned
I gots to try to fool the man
'Cause if I'm caught, I'm doin' 10 flat
So I'm gettin' it while the gettin's good, nigga, fuck that
'Cause if I fall short, nigga, then I'm ass out
And then we'll see what the judge try to pass out
I see some niggas we competin with
It's goin' down tonight in the village, and I can see this shit
So I'm on the telephone callin up the squad
""Get your shit together, nigga, we finna mob""
Before I hung up the phone, niggas was lettin loose
I grabbed my shit and tried to find my bullet-proof
But fuck it, niggas, ain't goin' for the chit-chat
They startin off with a headshot
So if I gotta die, then I gotta die, nigga
And when I fall on my ass, don't ask me why, nigga
It was just my time and the man came to get me
Fuck it - plus a bullet hit me
A straight niggaroe subtractor
Mr. Scarface Part III, muthafucka, The Final Chapter
The final chapter for real
(All I have in this world..)
Yep
He-he
I gotta - ehm
Shit, I guess I better talk about a broad then, huh?
Before I close this muthafucka off, right?
Check it out
Later on, all alone, sat around the house layin low
Waitin for these niggas to jump so I can buck a hoe
And just like I expected
A bitch came by in a gee wantin to get naked
Now shit's gettin' hectic
The situation's lookin' grim, so yo, I gots to check it
Clean those traps, all the other shit
I'm fuckin' one hoe, and in comes another bitch
So now I'm jackbonin two hoes
Who's the nigga in the Kamurshol? Fuck, nigga, who knows?
She musta knew the bitch that I was fuckin' with
And plus I'm strapped and she was suckin dick
Up and down with a smooth stroke
Takin' 9 inches of this dick like a deep throat
The other bitch was involved in masturbation
Oh shit - now I'm ejaculatin
I let loose and they was fightin for the white shit
I got a rubber tryin' to make my pipe fit
I finally made the cock crack
The bitch pulled a .330 and shoved it up my back
Then some niggas came out with a chainsaw
And tried to hack my muthafuckin brains off
These bitches set me up, y'all
Pussy - a nigga's quickest downfall
I couldn't do shit except take it like a man
But if I live, it's on again
But I wanted a quick piece
So I put down my piece and end up put down, deceased
She put the rifle to my muthafuckin head
Mr. Scarface is - naw, fuck that shit...
Ah-ha-ha

89,Murder By Reason Of Insanity,1991,Mr. Scarface Is Back (1991),,Scarface,"Niggas get stomped when they step with that bullshit
If you got a firearm, go ahead and pull it
'Cause I'ma put it dead on ya ass when you reach
I got a little friend on my shoulder that I think you wanna meet
A 9 millimeter, that will stop him
Get his ass focused, once I focus him I drop him
Boy you should of known not to fuck with me bitch
Brothers like me will make ???? rich
So if you got something that you think you wanna prove
You better prove it now, cause you don't get a second chance dude
One chance is all you get
And if I beat you to the draw, that's it
Get your momma's black dress and call your family
It's gonna be a murder, my reason insanity
I was born with a chip on my shoulder
Now that I'm older, momma's talking shit but I told her
""Mind your fucking business"" I love the girl to death
But I don't wanna hear it, save your fucking breath
I know my time is coming, and I ain't gonna lie
I may be scared of Jason, but I'm not scared to die
So when a nigga talk shit, and I buck 'em
Shoot me in the head, put me a box, and just say ""fuck 'em""
Later on that day I heard gunshots
Watching niggas running (Aiyo that nigga got shot)
Ran to the corner said ""What happened my brother?""
He just laid there shaking, bleeding like a muthafucka
God damn! ""Who would let that off to him?""
Man: Some niggas from your hood, Triple ?????
Get your shit together, we're heading for the village
I think its time to pay them hoes a little visit
Them niggas don't understand me
It's gonna be a murder, my reason insanity
Pulled up in a Rider, trailer full of niggas
Mack 10, Tech 9's, all with fingers on the trigger
Backed in the bitch like I was staying
Opened up the trailer, *gunshots* South Park started spraying
Bullets flying everywhere, niggas getting struck
Had dope in the village, but I didn't give a fuck
Shoot the bitch up, then I'ma leave her
If I can't sell my dope, then you can't either
Now here's a valuable lesson to learn
You fuck with mine, you get burned
Headed for the nigga who shot my partner
*Gunshot* Shot his father
Walkin' through the living room tearing up shit
He's loading up his pistol, ain't that a bitch
You should of had it loaded, he said ""Come on Scarface, hold it
I won't do it again man"" Yeah, I know it
I told you when you take mine, I take yours
Hands in the air, fell to the floor
""Please don't shoot Scarface""
I looked him in the eye - then I shot him in his face
A sucka's way out is to steal 'em
My dad said ""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
It had to be a murder, them hoes couldn't handle me
""What's your reason man?"" - Insanity"

Ooh, yo Vice drop this heat dog, ugh
Hit the bass line, yo Vice what you're doin' man
Straight up, ugh
(Verse 1: Scarface)
I'm too deep to quit, and too strick to fold
And you need to split nigga G into code
Come on, these years to teach, homey speak to know it
Bodybag what we're talkin' about, you weak, you row
The game is overcrowded so we fight for space
Neighbourhood show the hustle, still we grind to win
Tryin' to find a way, to come up on 2 pounds of yay
And double up it, ain't never happened touch it
A lot of niggaz focued on they candy paints
And that was in the grills, steering wheels and grand
But I ain't trippin' out here, flippin' I just need to thank
Money miny, yo all the mission tryin' to steal me bank
Ride and homicides we get it, fuck it, peepin' in horn
Killin' all these pussy niggaz think they keepin' in God
Pistol cocked on the block and all they fearin' is death
Then again nigga, roaddog you feelin' me yet
So if I die, I'm tryin' to get it mamma, barely deed
And pray to God that he kept this spot hell me
Sad as fuck, what the nigga stuck down the raw
Bust friends, back in the prison, foundin' rock to the troupe
Here I smoke and tryin' to hide it but was played by the rule
And if live like the gold fiend then you'd do what they do
I'm on my own limits sold buck words
All alone in the ghetto, deep in weed, sweat in Jelly Nose
Worrey eyes, you either do it or you die
Crimin' in flood, ridin' your blood, cause this is your life...
(Chorus: Johnny P)
Our golden law, now foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
And still ??Hurricane can be, ??
?? Loose when you pumped the face
Real nigga blues and it hold your aims
You're bold or fold no in betweens
Console your seems don't blow your creams
Also don't you loose your dreams
This is my life, this is my life
(Verse 2: Willie D)
I just got word: my uncle done died
But ain't no tears on my face 'cause I done already cried
I been here before, dead to me is not new
My heart safe it, mamma don't, cops too
I got my best to get my purpose to the Lord
But sometimes this shit be fuckin' with me hard
And I'm heartless, I'm a kid again
Lookin' out my window watchin' niggaz get murdered
In college worked the parties, step with??, drink ??
Just to get through the night
Go to school only the anchor stomach givin' you fight
Cause sure there were fights and I was bustin' like a the sun bitch
The smartest nigga on the block live in ??kick
The convicts with worry ?? hard to ?? to the tails
Searchin' for heaven and livin' in hell
They say I'm wrong for teaches this on
Fuck what you believe, can't heal by myself
That's the way I'm livin', this is my life
(Chorus: Johnny P)
Our golden law, now foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
And still ??Hurricane can be, ??
?? Loose when you pumped the face
Real nigga blues and it hold your aims
You're bold or fold no in betweens
Console your seems don't blow your creams
Also don't you loose your dreams
This is my life, this is my life
(Verse 3: Bushwick Bill)
I only got one eye but I see things ever so clear
Been acquainted with death but I never know fear
I still roll to spots, cats scared to go there
If it's a heaven for a G, if not, prepare to go there
I live for today and not promise tomorrow
Smoke weed and set lead and try to dry my sorrows
In this game of life ain't no rules to follow
And if I come to lie for them it's a hard heal to swallow
I'm still the smallest cat with the biggest rep in H-Town
Stress in my life is gettin' hard to take down
Havin' visions of cats rollin' in my weight now
It feels like I'm about to have a nervous break down
It takes a big man to share this pride
Tryin' to get my soul right and put the brain inside
Y'all niggaz are so scared to ride
They got it from Still I alive to Why I Feel So bad inside
This is my life...
(Chorus: Johnny P)
Our golden law, now foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
And still ??Hurricane can be, ??
?? Loose when you pumped the face
Real nigga blues and it hold your aims
You're bold or fold no in betweens
Console your seems don't blow your creams
Also don't you loose your dreams
This is my life, this is my life"
91,Never,2007,Made (2007),,Scarface,"(Samples of ""Sara Smile"" by Ronnie Dyson)
(Scarface)
I would, never violate the codes of the streets
And I would never make a promise, that I know I couldn't keep
And I would, never testify, cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police
And you could, never catch me on the block without a strap
And I would, never pull it out unless I'm bouts to black
And I could, never forget my homies dyin' for they scratch
Forever pourin out liquor for 'em, God send me back
And I'll, never shed tears, my heart is like a stone now
Never thought I'd live to see 21 look I'm grown now
Never say never they tell me all the time
Cause never means it's forever, but it's never crossed my mine
And I'll, never go broke, I promise I'ma shine
Never come short on my issue, I'm on it every time
And I'll, never be past it, you better gimme me mine
It's my money, and I want it, every motherfuckin dime
No I, never forgot all my struggles in the past
And I could, never forget how to hustle for my cash
And I will, never forget how I felt when I saw Brad
Take that first breath and from then, I knew I had to mash
And it could, never be said I went out like a hoe
Never been punked, I'll never let it slide, never let it go
Never ever, never ever ever no
Get on my level hoe, or get a shovel hoe
It's never any question for my manhood I get down
I'll never switch, never snitch, never sit down
I'll never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
I'll never squat to take a piss, who's the bitch now
I never ran, I never will, I ain't never scared
It's in my bloodline, the realest nigga ever bred
And that's some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics, I ain't never dead
I'll never disrespect my momma, never disrespect her momma neither
I'll never turn my back on Jesus
I'll never get caught off in the system, 'cause I believe a
Man that follows man, ain't no man, and I'm a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga, I could never trade
I'll never cross my homies out, that I ain't how I'm made
And I never had not one regret, on how I was raised
I'm from the ghetto, where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way, this ain't gon' never change
Never gon' bite my tongue, FUCK what nigga say
100 with myself I swore to God I'd stay the same
And when I finally got my paper, I was on my game
I'll never talk a nigga down, do yo' thang dawg~!
Never hate a dude for tryin', that's insane dawg
Get yo' motherfuckin money, that's the thang dawg
Too many homies dyin' young, feel my pain y'all"
92,Never Snitch,2006,My Homies Part 2 (2006),,Scarface,"(Scarface)
Niggaz forget about the streets but when they rap they songs
They claim they tote the heat, they quick to clap they guns
In interviews be braggin 'bout the crack they slung
But when it's war, these cowards never blast, they run
The fuck you think you foolin dog? I live this shit
I know it when niggaz fake it - I live this shit
You can front it all you want but when yo ass gets hot
Then you can rest assured nigga - yo ass gets got
I'm sayin' that to say this - I can plot those hits
I'm connected in every city on capo shit
I ain't even gotta say these niggaz know my ties
A nigga made, therefore whoever cross gon die
Money changin motherfuckers, makin' hoes grow nuts
You a bad motherfucker, you don't give no fuck
Let me snap you back to reality dude, shit's real
You a target, niggaz in Houston want you killed
Facemob until it's over, Southside the pipes
Dirty Third in this bitch, J. Prince for life
Dedicated to these niggaz live and breathe that shit
Let the real niggaz shout it out, scream that shit
(Chorus - Scarface)
I never snitch, I never lie
I'm not a bitch, I rather die
Can't nothin' change me, not even time
I make the money, money don't make me a dime
I make the money, money don't make me a dime
(Beanie Siegel)
Facemob! Yeah
B. Sieg baby, I'm back up in this bitch like what
Fresh out the pen, once again I'm here to grab my nuts
I am hell for real - you doubt it nigga? call my bluff
Only respect men that's real, you coward rat-ass fucks
Who raised you niggaz? Yo father probably hate yo guts
Mad he didn't double up, and that Lifestyle bust
Ya lifestyle fucked, ya duckin, every corner tryna clap at you
Plus fuck ya mother, the bitch ain't shit for havin' you
What? If you don't like what I'm sayin', fuck ya attitude
Same lame probably showed these rap niggaz gratitude
Huh, happy they ain't snitch on you
Must I remind yo monkey ass what a bitch might do?
They act like they got yo back to infiltrate yo rest
Then have you talkin' +Through The Wire+ like Kanye West
To all my real niggaz trapped homey, mind yo tongues
'Cause these cowards comin' home after firin they ones (?)
I never snitch
(The Game)
Snitch niggaz, bitch niggaz, they all the same face
No matter what hole you crawl in, nigga you ain't safe
All you niggaz is rats, nicknamed Jake
Sam, Curtis or Alpo belong in the same place
A penitentary cell block gettin' gang raped
Coward motherfucker, now tell me how my name taste
I leave you bleedin like ya period came late
Red bandana on, call that my Game Face
Niggaz come in all shapes
Some snitches wear Reeboks, some wear Bathing Apes
Sometimes they Crip niggaz, other times Piru
And some snitch niggaz look just like you
I promise to never snitch, like some of my homies
G-Rock, B-Mase, and O.G. Tony
Before I have the police run in ya house
I kiss my son on the cheek and put the gun in my mouth, motherfuckers
(Chorus to fade)"
93,No Problem,2015,Deeply Rooted (2015),,Scarface,"Greatest ever done it, you can learn from it
Dope game; ran it - rap game; run it
Street cred hundred, nerd turned D-boy
Naughty genetic make-up, baby, I'm a G-boy
Hashtag street-boy, wrong one to fuck with
Cross me at your own risk, play to get back, you can trust this
I am far from average, to me it ain't no such thing
Me against the world so fuck it I let my nuts hang
I've been known to bust bang, Kíli of the NEB
I don't need an army when the smoke clears, he sees me
Rhyming at its finest unlike those vaginas
They claim that they the real deal knowing I'm the highest
Time for the command chain, I am what the streets made
I am what the hood built, you are just a weakling
Homocidal maniac with suicidal tendencies
You're more like a punk band, I'm more like a pedigree
Nigga, you ain't seen yet so y'all can not describe me
I'm a freak of nature, Don't shit here surprise me
Money over everything except a nigga's manhood
I am not a prostitute, you don't understand hood
Fuck a nigga getting his unless he 'bout to give me mine
Otherwise he prime beef, shocking when I up the nine
And hit him with it several times, fuck you thought I was civilized?
Welcome to the jungle, fool, it's only right I punish you
Nigga with an attitude, feel like MC Ren felt
Quiet on the set, you funky bitch, you get your friend slept
I'll give your gang a black eye, blame it on the black God
I be on some nigga shit, I'm nigga rich so that's why
Guess what my religion is, this is what the business is
Expose you for your garbage ass rappers, you can witness this
Came to bang the game up, pussies think they came up
Oh, you got a drophead? So now you think you're famous?
Out here it's dangerous, if we don't know your name 'cause
We don't even give a fuck, rappers get it fucked up
Security save you? Nah, it's their side job
They don't want no conflict, they don't want no problem
Nah"
94,No Tears,1994,The Diary (1994),,Scarface,"Now the funeral is over and all the tears are dried up
Niggas hangin' deep on the cut gettin' fired up
Lookin' for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie
An eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me
Look deep into the eyes of your muthafuckin killer
I want you to witness your muthafuckin murder, nigga
And since you wants to kill, then your ass has got to fry
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slept I guess you sleep
You sho nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
'Cause where I come from, yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy, then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rollin' through your hood, now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house and now your sister's life in danger
(By a total stranger) with the ?kanga?
Niggas wanna bang ya and hang ya
Sting ya with one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holloway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standin' up for our own shit
And if you outside the click, then you die, bitch
It ain't no love in this muthafucka
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother
Because we real with this shit, so we stay true
And since we bang, we do what O.G.'s say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror
So I'm lookin' at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me
I've got my pistol pon cock
Ready to lay shots non-stop
Until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
'Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit
You muthafuckas know who run it
So when you put this muthafucka to the test
You gotta realize somethin', nigga: (you fuckin' with the very best)
I've got this killer up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother, so I talk to my diary
I'm goin' off on the deep end
I find myself face to face with myself while I'm sleepin'
I see your picture in my head and my hand shake
You can run, you can hide, but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this muthafucka before he gets to me
So in your own blood you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this muthafucka in his fuckin' grave
And I can say this once again
You can cry but you'll still die, there'll be no tears in the end"
95,No Warning,1997,The Untouchable (1997),,Scarface,"It's the return of the real nigga wit real shit
And when the smoke dies down its still a nigga left to deal wit
This mutha fucker standin one deep solo
Exercising parts of the game but don't know
I bring it to a mutha fucker full throttle
And any mutha fucker want pain I brought the full bottle
Now take ya two of these and call me in the morning
Three times point blank range wit no warning
Nigga I'm straight killa slash for show drama
And every mutha fucker involved gon' face drama
Punk I ain't no mutha fucka rappin' in song
You bust your caps when you rap
But I bust back at your dome bitch
And this is always all day killa
And bitches who be stressin me out I get rid of
I'm still a guerilla in these goddamn streets
Walkin' up on mutha fuckers and leavin' 'em sleep
('Cause if you gonna ride then we can ride)
But 99.9 of the times you gon' die
(Die mutha fucker die mutha fucker die)
Mutha fuckers crowdin my space they gon' die
I can't believe you hoes is playin' wit this
But since you mutha fuckers want drama I'll bring you this shit
I got my dime down cocked and shined
Just a homie from the hood
Had the paper still I'm bout to grind
What you thought this was nigga some studio gimmick
A mutha fucker talking that shit but couldn't spend it-shit
I come around this mutha fucker bending beads
And dare one of you hoes to come and fuck wit me
I'm real with it I'll warn you mutha fuckers again
That if you step to me wit ho shit I'm turning you in
Shocked-and shot wit five holes in your memory
And when you headed for hell you gon' remember me
The one MC who told you niggas once
And after that he gave no warning he straight done him- punk
I got my mind all made up to go off
When bitches start to threaten my life I go off
Take a walk on the wild side
And all the coloreds go whoop whoop
When I come down in my coupe
And mutha fuckers hatin' me come give it a try
But 99.9 of the times you gon' die
Wit no warnin
Dealing wit the killer wit the strap out
No warnin -then
All fo a sudden homie blacks out
Wit no warnin
And now your dealing with your outer body energy
All the pain you left in your life you still feeling me
Everybody living must have thought it would change
But living fast and dying young's a part of the game
How can one spit the game so sure
Turned around and emptied his than
Wit no warning"
96,Now I Feel Ya,1993,The World Is Yours (1993),,Scarface,"...It's a new day... ya know what I'm sayin'?
A new day, brings a new problem to a brother
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
Cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke
Either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
And with his help, my mother made a man of me
Didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in
Taught me how to save my little dividends
So when I graduated I'd have a little school money
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
And flunked outta school with the flag pole
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
'Cause we was alone, and me I bought an ""F"" home
My real pops he broke out with the style
So I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child
So now we livin' comftable
Taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldn't see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'
And ended up in a big fight
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now I'm livin' at my grandma's home
My grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own
And keepin' me ain't no big deal
But now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels
Being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke
And now the money's low
And pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go
Or either try to find a job so I can help out
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
So my family can have a better place to stay
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope
And now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong
She just prayin' for me heavily
Take care of her grandson
And the lord must of heard her prayer
'Cause he made me get a grip
And got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...
I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun
My baby's mother just had my first son
May eleven, I never will forget the day
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface
My first born and yo I'm a proud father
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father
And sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead
But what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk, and pampers tryin' ta do my part
And he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes, and jewelry not the Tonka toys
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
And I don't want my son to look at life
Through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like
But yet and still I let my son be a kid
Just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
And now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role
Because these years he'll remember most
So it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close
But I got a buncha obstacles
If it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybody's got my baby
Wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin' to drive me crazy
""It's your daughter, don't she look like you?""
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma dukes
Because my mother knows the real deal
All these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal
So now we in and outta court
Tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me
Now eveybody knows, that she was just fakin' G
Come to find out, the girl never had me
She's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy
And biological tests done proved
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
But now I finally got a real daughter
No need for the testin'
I know that I'm the baby's father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...
I feel ya...
Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife
And got a bigger stick to fight with
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick
Because we livin' in a concentration set
And everyday, we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
And judgement day is just somethin' we can't run from
So I know my number's comin' up
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up
And even though I hate killin' off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine
My brother corners tryin' to keep the neighbourhood at peace
Don't fight each other, we gots ta stand and fight the beast
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
Because we always tryin' to take another brother's shit
And the cops is in the same boat
Just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin' ta kill, they gats ain't sparkin' duds
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
And now the story's all twisted up
And if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldn't give a fuck
Because he left my partner's family with memories
And after hearin' this I know you don't remember me
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up
Because I know what you did was wrong
But you won't realize until you dead and gone
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning
You straight up shot him from behind
But all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back
You give a gat to a black he don't know how to act
But you gotta tell your story to the judge
Not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
Then in reality you took care of your business
But regardless I know you wanna kill me
But I ain't goin' out like dat
Ya feel me?
...Yeah"
97,O.G. To Me,2000,The Last of a Dying Breed (2000),,Scarface,"(Verse 1 - Scarface)
Stupid ho's that I use to fuck around wit
Way back, see a nigga now and they say that I changed
Put another notch in the game
You watchin the range, I'm floatin
And ain't no stoppin' the rain
Cock and I aim, I see you bitches jockin the name
Boppin to fame, a crooked nigga droppin' in pain
Rockin' a cain, back up bitch, you blockin my lane
Tryna foul on a nigga cause you hot in the flame
Fuck you, and them ho ass nigga's you run wit
Fuck your whole street, you ain't no motherfuckin O.G.
Cause O.G. means, means you a original gangsta
Understand pure motherfuckin man
Ain't no police or judges
Just nigga's holdin' grudges
You mark ass bitches is low budget
Straight traitor's, so fuck you and the glass that you puff on
Don't smile in my face, when you see me get the fuck on
Dope fiend ass nigga, tryna to get a free check
Talkin' that shit, but you's a motherfuckin bitch
So when you see a nigga on the flip duke
I'll flip you, you must be smokin' dip fool
Nothin' but a bitch fool
""Means, Means you a original gangsta
Understand pure motherfuckin man""
(Verse 2 - Jayo Felony)
Call baretta's on my dog, nigga's get sweated for they shit
If all a law enforcement, nigga's get deaded for that shit
Thought you was a street nigga, pulled a heat nigga at that
Come to find out was a cunt that got slapped, and didn't scrap
'Cause, you know what motherfuckers like you do wit nigga's on the set
Finish fuckin' face and leave ya clean cut shirt wet, and jet
'Cause, I'll smack the shit outta ya bitch ass you wanna run to the one's
Tell 'em about the cash and the stash, and were I got my guns
And you know I'm the bird man, 'cause I sold so much coco
Beware of the crack pipe, that's by far in ya life
I got heroin by the balloons, kabooms, and mushrooms
And my 38.specialist puttin' banker's in they tomb's
I'm one, shot, killed, and these bullets all go
And you takin' finger print's, and mugshots photo's
I use to beat bitch nigga's till they face turned blue
But they get weak in dice water, and pedal you in the sue
And it's true
(Kurupt Talking)
Yeah!gangsta shit, Kurupt Young Gotti, Daz Dillinger, Jayo, Face
Fuck all these bitches and these punk ass nigga's
Out this motherfucker nigga, they ain't talkin' bout shit

The chronical, psycho, brain bender busta
Fucker, sucka ass punk motherfuckers
Tommy the talent tucker, calico conseler
Daz the real dealer, motherfuckin busta killer
Facin all you nigga's, Scarface nigga

Shake, crack, and brake, no mistake nigga
Fuck em, stick em, stuck em, Chucks laced nigga

Kurupt Young Gotti, 6-4-4-5 me

Popped em, and dashed, fast and freaked
So fast instant??? is splashed
Fo' life, somethin' I ain't gotta say twice
Step 'cause, cause bustaz get rolled like dice
Uh-uh ass though, ice nigga, flow better then
We comin' to California shinin
(Verse 4 - Daz)
On my side of the world it's lo-lo's and jheri curls
Smokin' water by the pearl, runnin' the street wit double earl's
I did it all 'fore I can see, walk, and crawl
Made it out the ghetto, bustin' a male, so I can wet y'all
Took a while 'fore I ball
Wanted for eight or nine murder's and spoke came
For cocaine, raw game, another die for what he claim
And where I'm from they know my name, I cause lot's of static
Automatic's and canic's, and nigga's start to panic
Ain't no ruler's or leader's runnin' the set
Outta respect we G's, YG'S, and O.G.'s connect
Fifteen, sixteen in a chevy we roll
Get you full of hole's, god dog, you scream echo's in fo-fo's
Who dare to mack wit the tarantula and scorpion
Brought you in the depth's of danger when I tortured it
I love it when the bustaz squealin
And they chrome start spillin
Then ya start the grinnin, and said that nigga Daz did it
(Chorus until fades)"
98,On My Block,2002,The Fix (2002),,Scarface,"For the block boy, take it rough...
(Scarface)
Everyday it's been the same old thang on my block
Ya either workin or ya slangin cocaine on my block
Ya had to hustle, 'cause that's how we was raised on my block
And ya stayed on ya hop until ya made you a knot
On my block, to hangout was the thang back then
And even when ya left out, ya came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Belford, to Scotts
Reed road the blocks, we load the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On yo' block you probably bred a Fat Pat or Tupac
Or Big Pun, or B.I., ya homeboys from knee-high
And even when it was stormin outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me dawg, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggaz knew me back when I was stealin bell from Shamrock
And my nickname was Creepy, if Black June could see me
He'd be, trippin' - and I'd bet he still try to tease me
My block - where everything is everything fa sheezy
My block - we probably done it all homey believe me
My block - we made the impossible look easy, fa sheezy
My block - I'd never leave my block, my niggaz need me
(Scarface)
On my block, we duck the nigga-haters and the cops
Fuck a hotrod, we race Impalas, chromed-out
On my block - it ain't no different than the next block
Ya get drunk and pass out, and they back ya to the house
And when you wake up on the couch you goin' right back at it
On my block when ya that fucked up they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, makin' ya mark
On my block, we're cueing all the time, playin' dominoes
Keep the swishers sweet down until my mama goes
Back inside -- then we can fight
Pass it around a few times to get high
(Scarface)
On my block, everybody business ain't ya business
What's goin' on in this house is stayin here, comprende?
On my block, ya had to have that understanding
'Cause if ya told Ms. Mattie, she went and told Gladys
And once ya mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, the set yo' ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets shell-shocked
Who never quite got right, now they inhale rocks
On my block - it's like the world don't exist
We stay confined to this small little section with dividends
Oh my block, I wouldn't trade it for the world
'Cause I love these ghetto boys and girls
Born and raised, on my block...

99,On My Grind,2003,Balls And My Word (2003),,Scarface,"Artist: Scarface f/ Z-Ro
Typed by: escobar188@yahoo.com
When I was in the sixth grade, these niggas was bitch made
They was thinking science, I was thinking get paid
I always kept a plan to get doe
Like selling the same shit I use to steal from outta stop-n-go
I use to run a paper route
But that ain't pay me enough, I was still on the bus
My momma would always tell me don't you rush to get old
But rarely did I listen to the shit I was told
I was a ghetto boy long before the rap group existed
I use to take my lunch money and pitch it
I stayed on suspension, I ain't fuckin' with school
Truant officers be chasin' me, I'd give 'em the blues
Hit the pipes off of Roomer just to pass the time
Shoot the shit and walk to Shamrock, stole me a wine
Get smashed and hit the bus stop when school let out
Get off at tina house and bust that cot
Walk up outta Ridgemont smelling like fish in my pocket
Then back to the southside walking home from Watkins
I stopped to see the homies off of Huckala street
All you game in the front yard bumpin' this beat
(Chorus: Z-Ro)
Ever since I could remember I been on my grind,
All the time
Nothing but paper and pussy and the finer things on my mind
I had to Shine
By any means necessary I had to go out and get it
And come back wit it, thug life I was wit it
My balls and my word told a nigga that the world was mine
That's why I stay on the grind
I remember when the dope game started up, serving the hypes
I was seeing more doe than I ever seen in my life
I was rocking up eightballs and knowing the shake
Kept a thousand in my pocket, twenty more in the safe
I had my grandmother guessing how I got that shit
'Cause every other day I had to buy new kicks
Older cats steppin' to me as if I was the man
Getting telephone calls from my uncle's friends
I'm sixteen years old, with game so throwed
I was parking niggas frontin' me and fucking they hoes
Eventually I moved out, rented a house
I'm stretching the dope, cuttin' seventeen from an ounce
We cop ya pots fulla spray, I'm moving big weight
But that was back in the days, nobody thought about a dope case
It's all mapped out, get in get out
They giving mutha fuckas ten years for each rock
It's fucked ain't it, but I'm lookin' at the picture they done painted
They hanging all these niggas who's careers was dope gamin'
The crack epidemic had you locked if you was in it
And even if you stepped out with bread you couldn't spend it
In the beginning niggas had they whole hoods flooded
Wit that Antonio Montana disease like ""fuck it""
And drug wars just another day in the life
You fucked over me, I fucked you, done gave me the right
I'm up and down I-10, with a car full of hens
Finta check my ends, finta get this Benz
Stopped short of my drop spot by red lights flashing
I'm dirty, and if he wants to search I'ma blast him
I roll the windows down so I can show him my hands
Wouldn't you know, the cop done pulled me over my man
I got a brand new plan take this shit to the line
Stop an Sony's and give it back I'll give you a dime
With ten thousand you can go to work for a week
Take some time off to think, I'll even throw in a key
He stopped at the mo', I gave him the doe
Checked in my room then whooped out the scale and the blow
There's a knock at the door, I grabbed the four-four
It was the homeboy who set me up down on the floor"

And leave your body corpse parked at the Travellodge
You can't reason with a fool with guns and no brains
Thrown off your balcony get stoned and let's remain

So go on about my business bitch, and do what you do
You like to run shit

Kryptonite got me blowed 'cause I hit it five times
I got condom on my dick, but my mind is on scrilla
Bitches just respect this nigga Chuck and I'ma killa
Me and my nigga, four hoes, weed, and liquor
Headed to the boat to freak these bitches on the river
And since I'm from the south these hoes showin me love
And B is from the west, he really don't give a fuck
Twenty minutes later, all hell broke loose
Bitches suckin dick and lickin' up nut juice
One bitch said she like to eat pussy too
She looked at me, I said shit, bitch, do what you do

Raggedy-ass bitches
That bitch ain't no good
(VERSE 1: Scarface)
Look at your face all frowned up
The only thing you got goin' for ya is your fake tits and round butt
You're a rich nigga's worst mistake
You're just a trophy, and what make matters worse you're fake
A mall broad tryin' to keep up with the Joneses
Whatever they wear in the videos, you want it
You tryin' to find the nigga with the biggest contract
To get you pregnant, so you can ride around and get fat
And collect big money, with the baby all sharing
Got a 18-year career from child bearing
And only God knows what this kid'll go through
Got mixed feelings about his dad cause of you
The dollar signs popped up, that's what did it
And dude, he was just as fucked up 'cause he hit it
And now you out there buyin champagne for the club
To me that's kinda fucked up
(CHORUS: Devin)
Only your mother could love you
Much too freaky, you're easy
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I ain't never had to pay for mine
Only your mother could love you
Much too sneaky, you're freaky
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I wouldn't give a broke bitch a dime
(VERSE 2: Devin)
You used to turn up your funky-ass nose before I even stepped up
I guess fuckin' with me just wouldn't keep your rep up
I used to think about you when I'd go sleep, even dream
Of fuckin' you without a rubber, fillin your pussy with cream
But when I wake and see you again, it be the same old shit
I finally realized you just a plain old bitch
Started gettin' my shit tight rockin' shows every night
Gettin' my dick sucked, fuckin' hoes left and right
Workin hard to blow up, now you wanna show up
With your stretch mark titties and pussy lips all towed up
I heard you got married, that was it you thought
Until he kicked your ass and took back all the shit that he bought
Now you're lookin' for a shoulder to lean on
Bitch, I sho' hate it, cause my shit is dis-located
You was the only one I was thinkin' of
But now you got a face only your mother could love
Break it down
(Devin)
I can't do nothin' for ya
Only your mother could love ya
I can't do nothin' for ya
Aight, check this out
(VERSE 3: Tela)
Look, Young Tela a pimp by force, not a pimp by choice
See, these bitches ain't playin' when it come to the courts
They'll fold you like some foil when it comes to support
And you niggas out here trickin like nature takes its course
I'ma spit it till you're fitted, it's your main employ
See, I was trained and I was taught that a pimp keeps a choice
But you lames gotta change when you gave the whore a port'
One weekend at the Allstar and the bitch bought a Porsche?
I ain't mad, girl, flip em, you can get em, look we did it
Cause his mind was all twisted off the aether from the clinic
Now hit it, oh lawdy, look at shawty
Mission hit your boy for a four and a forty
Miss done get your Ford for a house - ""Help me homie""
See, I can give a fuck about your loss 'cause you're phoney
You'se a lame and she seen it in your heart from the start
Why she ripped yo ass apart? It was lying in her cards
But eh, she'll only come up with another, I don't trust her
But she got one hell of a hustle
You black-hearted bitch, you are full of lies
So like go on and suck Young Tela and die"

Yo Nod
What's up B-lo?
Hey man, niggaz tryin' to stir up shit between amongst us
And Chicago man, what you think about this shit?
Ah, between us and the Snypaz?
Man I'm talkin' about us and every muh-fuckin' body, man
Ah but you know we too tight up in Chicago
We got love worldwide baby don't stop, north, south, east and west
That's right, know what I'm saying, straight up comin' to you
Snypaz and Do or Die, Rap-A-Lot mafia
From the Chi, here it go like this
I went from zip locks and bakin soda
To smokin' herb, cookin 'ola
Never lookin' overnight success
'Cause I want a Rover
Hold you head up and stick yo chest out
And if you heavy off in this game then get yo vest out
I hit the scence like po-po's
In the four door Chevrolet, we gas
With hats broke off to the left
To show you exactly where you at
I want the scratch that you done say
Remember, bust a cap a lot
For the rooftop Snypaz snap a lot
Puttin' down with Rap-A-Lot
You'll die, can't fuck with us
So when you say it, you'll a lie
You'll try and get shut down
From Texas all the way back to Chi
Ain't no success even if you cryin for it
Them niggas alive know it, they dyin' for it
Even them niggas that kill, get caught, and strive for it
I strive for it
That's why I sixteen years and a positive
Try to let go of my negative
Only got one life to live
It's fucked up, only had one chance
And now I'm takin' it
See niggas fakin it
If a nigga ain't real then his ass ain't makin' it
Overnight, I had to do more than hold the mike
Had to control the fight
Had to make sure my dough was right
Had to make sure my boys was tight
Noise and lights, stalkin from the end of my (?) gonna spook ya
Horror type of tactics, you bet the Snypaz (?) knew ya
Stressed out, had me feelin' left out
Stuck and I gotta get my self out
But when I was kid then crept out
Fuck all the ones who never helped out
Stepped out with grams and plans to be an overnight achiever
Since (...?...) to non-believers, overnight
You can do what you wanna do
But it ain't gonna happen for you
Not overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight
Livin' it up, this ain't no overnight shit
See (?) got a death wish
But Do or Die and Snypaz, represent Chi-Town
Took a life and get lit up quick
Rain niggas got me doin' this
Used to be on some sell ass shit
Or mail that bitch back home in a box
And leave no trail of this
Now won't witness this and this is
How's it's gonna fall
All of y'all gonna battle
Leave this life, all shells gon drop tonight
You say that you want a spot
Better they hit like the shit from Rap-A-Lot
So pack that glock or AK stops your clock, my straps get hot
Even though it's hot it ain't hot enough to stop this entourage
Rain, Do or Die, pick a piece Snypaz, one big mob
Better stop that heart
Beuregard this industry from backyards to owin Lexus cars
So flex that shit cause down in Texas, everybody talks
Cause ain't gonna fall, overnight
(Rock Roc)
I got an American dream of gettin' out the ghetto
Runnin' out they mails
About the loved ones that said they love me, but didn't care
Do Roc scare? With the fuckin' niggas who groundin me
It's Roc on the block, 45 glock cocked
Finna pop these niggas and they drop
I'm screamin more and more and more war
Killa for scrilla and more war, more war (more war)
I'm screamin more and more and more war
Killa for scrilla and more war, more war (more war)
A to the muthafuckin K
Runnin' through the gateway bustin' at the niggas back
Uh, Ooh wee, whip a, nigga, wit his, own gat
Oh snap, you in the business, dump him in the tar
Point blank range, nigga I'm game, do anything
(..?..), (..?..), Hangin' out the window
Me and my comrades take a nigga out his shoes
Rule number one, don't get it confused
I'm talkin' bout that one three, s-h-o-t
Nine millimeter kill 'em off of me
Make 'em freeze
Kill for my nigga that'll kill for me
Infa, red, lights and bombs leave a bitch, a nigga his arms
Stay alarmed, Vietnam, when I closed caskets
Pimp, lyrical tactics, shit look hectic
When I bomb a bad bitch
1997 niggas, and you can't do it overnight

103,P D Roll 'em,1991,Mr. Scarface Is Back (1991),,Scarface,"* Send corrections to the typist
(Verse One)
Here it comes fool, I play a game where there's no rules
Homies on the cut call me Joe, 'cause I'm so cool
Quick to get 'em up with a nigga, I ain't dodgin' them
Win, lose, or draw in the hood, I'm squabbin' them
Representin' the Park since I'm living here
Walkin' through the hood from another set, give it here
And after the jackin', you still want more, heh
Fuck your posse, it's time for the coroner
Don't fuck with the Park nigga swarm
More niggas found dead in my hood than in Vietnam
Rollin' seven deep to a car
Quick to take that ass to war, yo
It ain't no sleep being lost
Cause territorial rights are being enforced
So when you're rollin' up, Holloway floor it
And if a nigga flags you down keep going
Don't stop and sell your soul
You'll fuck around and get your ass P.D. roll
(Verse Two)
The last album past gold
And you wanna know the meaning of P.D. roll
Well I'ma break it down for you real clean
*Gunshots* know what I mean
In other words getting blasted
Shootin' at a bastard, to see if he can last it
9 times out of 10 he can't
So that's one more nigga in the paint
You see, when I go to work
I hit a muthafucka where it hurts
Starting off at his home sight
And fuck up a nigga's whole night
You out of there, just like that there
For jumping in the ring with a bear
It's easily executed
Put the pistol to the head, cock the hammer back and shoot it
You can't get it no cleaner
Make a hit, break quick to the Beamer
And South Acres to the hole
And don't be no fool and get your ass P.D. roll
(Verse Three)
My own hood is confusing me
Shit just ain't what it used to be
I'm stepping back on my old block
The finest bitch in the hood smoking crack rock
Even the niggas I was raised with
Are walking around in a daze and shit
Man: ""Say now, can I get a dollar for a cold one?""
And got his hands out like I owe him
But I don't owe nann nigga
I was ??? in the hood until I got bigger
I hollered at my boys in the game
And only a couple of them changed
Peace to Q-Dog, Cool Coin, and Old Mack
And all the rest of my boys down with Ac'
The rest ain't about jack
But I still love the hood, so it ain't about that
It's all about being down with it
Shit, to be got, you gotta go out and get it
Like my nigga doing time in the ???
Now that was a down muthafucka
A couple of keyss, my nigga stole 'em
Straight up fuck 'em P.D. roll
So lay it down in the dirt
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt
That's how it is, and always will be
I had to have it, even if it killed me
The sight of losing didn't thrill me
So I had to go and steal G
Just to make a quick one
And I ain't give a fuck who fell short to be a victim
You and your family bro
Your ass out of line, your ass got P.D. roll"

Grab ahold to the tec, put a hole in your chest
Grab your ass by the neck then lay your soul to rest

I been be's on a nigga, put these on a nigga
Squeeze on a nigga, now ease on nigga
'Fore you get peed on nigga, you know what I'm about
I'm a nigga from the ghetto, comin' straight out the South
Keep my name out your mouth, 'fore I pop up at your house
Put a bullet in your spouse and set a flame and bounce
I'm the wrong nigga to deal with, 'cause I be on some real shit
Worst one to play with, so careful what you say bitch
Y'all be on some gay shit, my heart pump the G shit
Don't start shit won't be shit, 'cause I'll expose your weakness
With a gun at the playground, makin' niggaz lay down
And your ass like stay down, the fuck you gotta say now?
Niggaz is silent when the pistol's in they face
And the barrel's in they teeth and they breathin the oily taste
And the reaper's standin over ya heavin can hardly wait
For the heathen to squeeze it and leave you leanin on the gates"

I use to watch you on stage gettin'money, lookin' lovely
Got these niggaz offerin they pockets tippin you twenties
'Cause you cold with that shit that you do... ya mood shocked me
Unlike these other hoes in ya crew you don't jock me
I'd like to get ya phone number just to see what you about
Call you for breakfast to get you out
And see if you just some eyes without a face
Let me see ya crib - take me to ya place
I wanna show you that it's mo'to me then fuckin' on my mind
'Cause in yo mind I bet you fuckin' all the time
Come to find you only out tryin' to go to school
And tryna go to school and pay bills is hard to do
I see you fool so go on and do ya thing
But when you tired of showin ya titties give me a ring
I like a woman gettin' hers cause that's better
Then her tryna come up off mine I can't let her
(Chorus - Bun B sampled)
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke (Repeat 4x)
(Verse 2 - Z-Ro)
Go on and let a nigga peak, go on and let a nigga poke
Give me some assistance as I maneuver my long stroke
I hope you don't think I'm payin'for it that's the wrong hope
'Cause I know you wanna be Z'Rollin' over chrome spokes
Bitch I know you wanna tell ya girlfriends how it was
To get hit from the back, in the back of the 'Lac by a thug
And to get ran through until you get carpet burns off the rug
And to get nutted on by nine niggaz with diamond grills and guns
And how you got on my microphone and sung a sixteen
Ya performance deserves a grammy check out my big screen
Most bitches don't know but you know what suckin a dick mean
Yeah the head was fed but what up with that in them jeans
I can see the pussy (?) lookin' like a big bee
Make ya cycle start early my shovel be diggin deep
I don't wanna relationship, I just want me some relations
Go on and let a nigga poke hoe, and stop shuckin with my patience

Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke (Repeat 4x)
(Verse 3 - Pimp C)
Bitch get down on me at the drop of a dime
Fuck all that R & B singin' shit I ain't got the time
I'd rather bust yo'ass up with some screwed and chopped
Let me test ya jaws and let me stretch out ya cotton
I'm still Pimp C bitch, the name ain't changed
Puttin' stick up in these hoes don't remember they name
'Cause we tired of playin' games with them booty lickers
'Cause we jumped up in ya life, 'cause I'm a true dirt digger
So go on hit the streets, break them lame tricks
Then bring it back to daddy that's how you can get this dick
I need the cash first - and the ass last
And we can blow dro in the Benz while I smash on the gas
So let a nigga pimp, and let a nigga mack
And later on tonight you can get hit up in ya back... and get ya money back
But when I make ya pussy skeet bitch you gon'buy me a 'Lac

I ain't tryna talk a hole in yo head
But I can tell you didn't excel what them hoes done said
Starrin' at my neck and my wrist 'cause my shit is frozen red
And I look like a easy hustler so go ahead
Ya leavin' the same way ya met me
You gon'be grievin if you sex me, while I'm schemin on the next piece
I'll poke ya cookie I don't give a fuck who know this
Who up in the area that aknowledge what a hoe is
All my warriors is lovin' my rep
How I took it to the world from the project steps
Playin' touch with my broad like my children
And it ain't like back in the days when we ducked behind buildings
I be a threat to tell a broad what I'm feeling
Especially if she poor and she need to be gettin' no bullshittin
She ever fix her mouth for some money it's good with me
I ain't the one what you need is a stool pigeon

Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke (Repeat 4x)
(Verse 5 - Petey Pablo)
If you think I'm a treat a bitch with high price drawls
Any differance then the way I treat the grandma's on
How many ways is there to say that you terribly wrong
Would you understand me better if I just said ""naw""
Fuck what another motherfucker told y'all
That's tipical talk when they dick hard
They just wanna little pussy mama that's all
It's like fourth down, two yards fuck it they goin' for it
How am I payin'for it?, and how much you charge for it?
It ain't about being a whore that's what it's made for
Get ya paper baby fuck what the world say
Get ya bills paid... okay!
(Chorus - Bun B Sampled)
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke

Clutching on steal triggers
Pouring kool-aid on hilfigers

Take a bullet to my gut for
Shoot up your 'cause for
And nigga you askin' me what for?
'Cause this check I wrote until death won't bounce
'Cause to quit is to care and excuses don't count
Yeah, the real nigga blues
Short sticks and long brooms
Two feet planted whether it be the tomb or the courtroom
Bullet wounds in my flesh
Powder burns I digest
On the front line I press
Until in peace I may rest
For battles I can't win
With stripes I must defend
Done been to the pen, behind friends
And I still can't turn my flags in
When you break weak I got to stand strong
I strive to go hard while you strive to go home
These checks I write are required day and night
For better or worse, ups and downs
Or just plain old fist fights
Packin' all the weight
Puttin' in work from birth
Running myself in the dirt
And you askin' me why my back hurt?
Even when your gal tried to give me some fish
I eighty-sixed that shit
Pulled your coat but you was scared to dismiss that bitch
But I guess you got to be one of me or walk in my shoes
Or drink from the cup that I drink to feel my blues
Yeah, the real nigga blues
I can't bend, brake, front, fraud, fold or get hacked
It's like I'm married to this game and my team looses if I get sacked
Turning down licks on niggaz I know ain't got no heart
Arguing with my baby momma because she's convinces you'z a mark
My word is my bond, my life is my son
My duece is my gun, and my fear is to have none
'Cause I refuse to run
And for my honor I'd die, and for my mother I'd lie
My heart done got hard
I still show regards, call out to the Lord
But it seems like I can't cry
So when bullets fly...
Yeah, it's my fault
Locked in with no way out
Fuck some clout, this is what I'm about
Even if I am the only one to get caught
It ain't in me to back down
That's like laying my gat down
Nigga I ride for the cause, and I hide from the laws
And I ain't scared to get ragged on
And for my crown... yeah
Caps gonn peal
I ain't no threat, nigga but I will kill
And to all my partners up under them hills
Y'all know how it feels and that's real
Yeah, dig these blues
The real nigga blues
Dig this
My partners hit a lick for two and a half bricks
And since I'm the cornerstone of the clique
They came to me when the shit got thick
I took in all their evidence and made it mine
Not realizing that while they were ballin'
I'd be doing time
All they had to do was push the witness out of existence
And I would've walked because the case was inconsistent
But insted they got caught up in the joys
Of the fruit from the hussle
Said fuck me, let the witness live
And I got twenty five years
All 'cause I kept it real
A mark would've squeeled
But insted I chilled, put it on the pill
But got ?chofferred in? a deal
See I respect the code of the streets
The code of the ?jeeks?
But when they gave it to me they said 'Fuck the police'
We'll never help these hoes solve a case
Now tears in my sons face
Because his daddy is out of place
With no trace of my peers
Missing my little nigga younger years
All because I kept it real
Regrets?
Sometimes have some
I'ma walk when me time come
It wasn't my prints on the gun
In yo' eyes, you'z a real nigga
So what you would've done?
Stand strong?
I'm not surprised
I was in the county camoflauging my cries
Squabbling niggaz twice my size
For mistaking tears for fears in my eyes
But I ain't ask to be real
I was born like this
Sacrificing my fo' sho's for your maybes
Got me scorned like this
Tattered and torn like this
But my roots won't pluck
I'm the only reason your tooth won't buck
But is my authenticy worth the price I be paying?
All the shit I've been through
Nigga, do it look like I'm playing?
I'ma be down till I get laid down
All the ex-real niggaz would've still be real
Only if they would've stayed down
But these my blues
I just spread the news to who I choose
A tale of a real nigga
Can you dig his blues?
Yeah, the real nigga blues
And all I got are my balls and my word
Yeah, my balls and my word"
108,Recognize,2003,Balls And My Word (2003),,Scarface,"...Motherfuckers out here rapping for protection
I'm gonna expose yo ass you bitch...
See me in these motherfuckin' streets (don't stop), with ya fag ass
Gangsta Walk, yeah right, ya pussy...
Look out, we everyday grinding
Everybody in the North gotta love us down South 'cause we blindin'
And we don't trip the big diamonds
We mainly focus on the old schools with big blocks lying
And I been around the world in one day
Chucking up the duece for S.A.
I'm a hood cat, and that's for searching me a hood rat
With good cat, something beautiful to look at, fa sho
I kick it for my niggaz in the ghetto
And all my homies in the federal-
Lock up, behind the wall setting shop up
They beat the block up, yet and still they couldn't stop us
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta back at it
'Cause I'm the last of the Dons, God damm it
I hear ya talking, but I don't cater to the chit-chat
But when I see you in the streets I got ya get back (word)
It ain't enough protection on ya ass, to fuck wit Brad
I got a lesson for ya ass
I showed ya, the Southside niggaz tote heat
I showed ya, the Northside niggaz roll deep
Ya weak, 'cause I'm the biggest fish in the pond
And when I say the magic word, bitch ya gone
Assassinated, people lay steppin'
Eliminated, enemy with aggression
Sit back and smoke me one
The Obi Won Kenobi one
Fuck the champagne sippin', woodgrain grippin'
I'm spittin' for the Vice Lords, gangstas and Crips and Bloods
And everybody neighborhood
From the Idery Wells, back down to Inglewood
How can a nigga from the South get a pass in every section
And walk the projects with no protection
Be surrounded by a mob, and not get robbed
Considered to be a savior, and not be God (Whoa)
Listen to the nigga flow now
I can speed it up or slow down
Face the facts baby, I got it locked like this and like that baby
Southern rap/rock baby
The last of a dying, we born again
The vicous life religious, I was born to win
The closoure after the greatest hit the sofa
When I still ride for Prince like a soldier
The two-thousand millennium comes
Since I'm the son of the father, that makes me the Don
The next up to bat, the Jordan, larry, cousy yo of rap
And I ain't gotta walk around strapped
J don't tollorate the mack dirties
You in our motherfucking way, we tryin' to stack 30s
Now back it up, for he send something back to you
Ain't plan to defend
Staying loyal to the Prince to the end, so recognize
So what you gone do Face? (Play till I win)
So what you gone do? (Double back and do it again)
So what you gone do Face? (I'm a play the game till I win)
So what you gone do? (Play till I win)

So what you gone do? (Double back and do it again)
So what you gone do Face? (Play the game till I win)
So what you gone do? (Then I'm a double back and do it again)
So here it is fool, I play the game where it's no rules
Dropped out in the 10th grade and told my mom to fuck school!
'Cause they ain't teach a nigga shit, I learned to read when I was 5
And plus I been smart a long time
Fuck a history test, I'm more concerned about respect
I make my moves in an L like a night nigga check
It's on till the break of dawn, I keep it on
And on and on, and on and on and on and on
Like clockwork, we hit these niggaz where it hurt
Knock they dicks in the dirt
Now you the bitch that's in the skirt
I'm passed the motherfucka out here paying his dues
Not the average nigga out here rapping claiming he true
I just stick to the script and take it in stride
Get my daily dose of game from James and take it and ride
Yes yes y'all, funky fresh and in the flesh y'all
This time I'm aiming at the neck dog
It ain't no ducking when I'm bustin', I'm a leave you a nice-
Little whole in ya throat, releavin' ya life
I'm going out with a bang, letting my nuts hang
I'm outty like flame, the signature just James, recognize
So what you gone do Face? (Play till I win)
So what you gone do? (Double back and do it again)
So what you gone do Face? (I'm a play the game till I win)

109,Redemption Song,2008,Emeritus (2008),,Scarface,"I'm too hard to kill, I refuse to die
Sweat tears and blood, paid dues survive
In these streets I roam, I've been blessed to live
Could've easily got caught up in my yesteryears
But I'm here, my story remains the same
I ain't changed a bit, I speak words of pain
From a frozen heart, lost what's left to lose
I'm alone and what I promise is death to you
And it's true my only fear is I have none
My conscience makes me keep me to myself 'cause I blast on
And I can fall asleep right next to a dead man
I'm cold, I put bullet holes all off in your headband
So bring me death 'cause I've been itchin' to see
If it's an afterlife, aim it at me, cock it and squeeze
Please back to back to back to back to back to back, nigga
From my first fuckin' album nigga
And I still can't be fucked with, trust me
I'm the truth in here, I give up what's real
Not afraid to die, not afraid to kill
But afraid to lie and too scared to steal
'Cause what's mine is mine and what's his is his
In these streets it's clear, punishment's severe
If that line is crossed that's when them guys appear
It's like nothin' you've seen, so fuck what you've heard
It ain't what you believe 'cause it's deeper than words
If silence is broke then somebody's comin' to blow
Holes in yo' upper body, leavin' a bloody coat
To be viewed by these dudes who feel like this
When it's enough said, it's bloodshed, believe that shit nigga
'Cause we that sick nigga, you see that bitch, get her
'Cause he that snitch nigga, so squeeze that's it, figure
That you watch what you say, you say it and die
What you cherish is close to me so don't testify
Straight up hood nigga, made it rappin'
Yeah, caught a break
My life put down in words, homey
That's some real shit, yo
A rapper you hated to love, respected and feared
What I'm capable of there's nothin' they say in our ears
I'm a soldier for fortune, I've got murderous plots
Plus I'm suicidal, walkin' this parking lot
With my dangerous thoughts, I'm a dangerous dude
When I up it and cock the hammer I'm aimin' dude
I came in to do, I'm a killing machine
And with life comes a price so I triple the fee
When it's trippin' with me, either win or you lose
In the end he who wins is he who finishes fools
I'm sentencin' you, to a home in the sea
With lint in your pockets, you rolled with weed
Exposin' the weak, you hoes fin' to sleep
With the fishes bitches and y'all should know the demeanor
Yeah, everything that I say I am nigga, I am
Know the rest of you motherfuckers wish you could be that real
I tell you what my nigga, be real with your motherfuckin' self
I am Facemob nigga, I am the best nigga
I am the back to back to back to back nigga
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah"
110,Rooted,2015,Deeply Rooted (2015),,Scarface,"You win some, you lose some, life in a nutshell
Free all my niggas on locked down, fuck jail
I've seen enough hell to never wanna live there
Tattooed teardrops, sitting in a wheelchair
Kids on the streets doing bad, momma moved out
Dopeman pushing on the corner where the schoolhouse sits
This is bullshit, this can't be life
I can't blame it on the hood 'cause it gave me life
This a stick-up, don't turn it to a 187
I don't go to church so I'm far from a Reverend
Ain't nothing like a young nigga, armed with an AK
Walking up the sidewalk, shooting in the broad day
Fuck what a broad say, I'm all day villain
I'm getting money so I'm always chilling
And even though they say I'm killing all they children
I'm just a nigga hustling for my million dollars
(Papa Rue)
You know I stay rooted
I stay rooted
I and I stay rooted
Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
I and I stay rooted
Now if I had to play Jack, I'll be leaving you bad news
Everybody in here be bound and gagged too
I'm postin' at your crib nigga hurry yo ass home'
You was out here hi-capping and all yo stash gone
The money met the work and that's a real life no-no
It don't take a bunch of niggas, just me solo
I go for dolo, I can't tell on myself
Immature ass niggas get you sentenced to death
Loud talking in the tank like he a stoned cold killer
And you fighting a murder charge, my nigga?
The moral of the story is keeping your mouth shut
'Cause everybody is listening, speaking you fucked up
I tell you like them old cats say: get what you get and get your ass out the way
'Cause greed'll get you 35 type, you're 27, that's the rest of your fucking life

Crooked officer, crooked officer
I stay rooted (beh!)
I and I stay rooted
(It's in my DNA, my blood type G, my roots is deep up in these motherfucking streets)
Real recognize what's real, the bullshit see through
The way I spit it, ain't another one that's equal
This for my people in the game ten toes, rooted in the streets, and withholding info
We got secrets we gone take to the grave
We don't honor nothing else, except the rules of getting paid
And no wonder why a motherfucker hustling dope
Everything we doing legal equal leaving us broke
What I hope is that a nigga don't forget where he from
And turn his back on his hood 'cause he's seeing some crumbs
And no money in the world that's enough to respect, when somebody take a gun and put it up to your chest
Saying 'fuck it' at the same time he squeezing a round
You can blame it on your homeboy for keeping you down
If it was me, I'd be leery of the people I meet, 'cause in this motherfucking game niggas playing for keeps

111,Safe,2002,The Fix (2002),,Scarface,"I got the new 'Face tape I'm about to, pop in the deck for you niggaz
Turn up your radios
(Scarface)
You're down and out, money funny, you hustle and die
On the verge of pawnin your jewelry and sellin your ride
Somebody shoulda told him ain't no life in these streets
You only out here till you touch it, when you touch it you eat
Niggaz done took too many chances shovelin snow
And ended up facin a lifetime for tryin' to sco'
I'm givin' livin' definitions on the subject of dope
One week he back on his feet, the next he's Whoa
I was a 70's baby, raised in the 80's
I was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
I remember in the 80's, me and pop would ride
Now we conversate on acres we's about to buy
He had already been what I'm about to go through
Told me ain't no sense in gamblin if you gamble to lose
If you made twelve dollars, you put seven away
And lived off the five, and never ever fuck with ya safe
But when
When he hustle and he robbin
That's when niggaz start plottin
And when you niggaz start plottin
Us country niggaz start mobbin - mobbin
(Scarface)
I'm bout my paper, these other niggaz slang for the sport
Like unaware tomorrow ain't promised, the game is too short
I've witnessed niggaz get it all and give it away
Gettin' back was out of the question, they lived for today
Then the hunger pains start up, then the murderous plots
To set up, they fuckin' homeboy to get what he got
I mean the ones he broke the bread with, the ones you don't want
To be the ones fuckin' your girlfriend the moment you out
I know the street game backwards, forwards, sideways
It used to be an honest hustle back then but nowadays
It's cutthroat, that's fucked up, niggaz want they come up
So bad they'll take the .357 and smoke they brother
A damn shame; but, that's the way the game go
A chance niggaz is takin' especially if they slang dope
I've been in that position, back in the day
And feel my homey, hittin my head to crack in my safe
And that's when
When ya hustle ain't evolvin
That's when niggaz start starvin
And when you niggaz start starvin
That's when you niggaz start robbin (when these niggaz start robbin)
When these niggaz got problems
That's when niggaz start plottin
And when you niggaz start plottin
Us country niggaz start mobbin - mobbin
(Scarface)
So listen up my niggaz, and I ain't tryin' to preach
I'm just tellin' it from my side 'cause I'm in the streets
I done been there, done that, seen a whole neighborhood
Destroyed by the government bein tipped off by one rat
He caught a dope case and they threatened him with time
He get his own fuckin' people jammed and he take the five
That's the shit there; they ain't even catch him with dope
But they gave him thirty-five years cause the nigga done spoke
Snitchin, that's a motherfucker, watch what you say
You don't know no-motherfuckin-body, nigga you lame
Watch your so-called homeboys, keep to yourself
Stay away from niggaz gettin' caught that get out of jail
Don't talk about your business, keep yo' thoughts in yo' head
And this game it got a paper trail, watch where ya spend
Don't write down names and numbers, it's a memory thang
Never shit where ya sleep, keep the crib out of range
And plus you never let these niggaz know where you stay
'Cause when the push turns to a shove, they hit and you say...
... True motherfuckin game... true motherfuckin game
When ya hustle ain't evolvin
That's when niggaz start starvin
And when you niggaz start starvin
That's when you niggaz start robbin
When these niggaz got problems
That's when niggaz start plottin
And when you niggaz start plottin

Flipping the script, from balling back to gansta rap classics
You know that shit that hit the hood and upset it
If real niggas respect it, the squares gon' rep it
I done came in here to bring it to you
The uncut version of ganstarism with the nickel painted Ruger
Quick to cock it on you, spark light in your eyes
The unexpected is happening to you now nigga, surprise!
Who is it? (Face, marchin', mobbin')
You said it one more time (Face Mob)
What else? (we keep you)
Now motherfuckers lay it down
The ruler's back, 'cause it's too many pussies out here
Making bullshit records and ruining rap
I gotta check this whole game; niggas out here listening
To these record label bitches instead of doing they thing
I'm a real nigga, a street nigga till it's done with
And I could never let you talk me into dumb shit
Like selling out to move a few more units
Just keep me in the ghetto cause the hood stay truest
You fuck around and cross the other side of the track
Catch you a brick then realize that you can't come back
I'ma stick to the facts
Fuck it if I don't go two
The homies know that Face stay true
And though I've got more muscle, my sounds don't change
Been the same ever since I stepped in the game
Now, this is for these niggas switchin' they shit
Prostituting theyself, trying to get them a hit
Suck a dick
You a sellout nigga
Bow down nigga before they fuck around and find you face down in the river
Talk down nigga and I'ma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga
You a sellout nigga and I'ma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga
Fo sho I talk a lot of shit but you can bet that I'm the nigga
Out here backing it up, while you acting it up
I can prove you ain't as real as what you claiming to be
You the king on your block, but you ain't shit in DC
You ain't shit off in the city of Chi
You ain't shit off in the Do It or Die
They want to skin you alive
Out here talking like you carrying arms
We don't shoot at motherfuckers, we done flipped the script to carrying bombs
I can end it for niggas out here who's hard in the booth
Any city I can hit the hood cause Scar is the truth
I know so much about these streets that I can walk them asleep
You can't tell me shit about your hood, I walked on your beat
I know your whole life story, plus I've seen for myself
You got caught smoking dope, that's why they sent you to jail
Had you locked up with wet backs, only real niggas suffer set backs
90 days and I ain't goin' to respect that
And you can sniff a snitch a mile away
Fuck him in his ass and feed him dick, a pound a day
You a sellout nigga
Bow down nigga before they fuck around and find you face down in the river
Talk down nigga and I'ma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga
I've got niggas I was raised with who know who I am
Lil' Brad from out of South Acres, prone for scams
Never ducked the motherfucker, I was down for the dirt
Got respect from older cats 'cause I was down for the work
When Fondren had its Great Skate I'd roll to the club
Drunk off the bird with thumbtack holes in my glove
Stood in the corner waiting for bullshit to jump
And in the event it jumped you saw a fool get stomped
There it is, can't get this shit no realer than that
Had a super boxing game, but now I'm peeling your cap
I done been in fist fights with niggas twice my size
Got an incredible record, 27 and 5
And the 5 losses I got, I had to redeem 'em
So he had to fight me every time I seen him
Ain't no pussy in me, I've been for real before this rap shit
I study MCs, that's how I know you hoes is plastic
So-a, shake your ass and I'ma tell 'em the truth
Fabricate your bumps and bruises homey, do what you do
Just remember who for real when they tell you they real
I survived the game of life nigga, fuck some skills
You a sellout nigga
Bow down nigga before they fuck around and find you face down in the river
Talk down nigga and I'ma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga"

Born in the city where the niggas die young
Mist-covered street corners collapsed where I slung
And everybody standin stiff waitin on the cake
I'm waitin on a muthafuckin break, ain't no escape
Make no mistakes and leave a muthafucka breathin
They all got to die this evening, 'cause I believe in
You kill a muthafucka 'fore a nigga come through
With his crew makin' your nightmares come true
Now who gon' be the first to die 'cause I'd extinguished your whole click
Gimme the money, nigga, no shit

Now I'm havin' dreams of firin at them lames
I used to have dreams of retirin from the game
Now as fast as I got it, I'ma lose it
See, the cash and narcotics made me ruthless
Timer know the real, they heard the situation
'Bout the drama in the Ville, I'm 3rd generation
Now they wanna put a jacket on my risen hustle
'Cause I couldn't hack it livin' in the struggle
Now I live every minute like my last one
Labelled a menace and a threat, and I'ma blast em

Bitch it's steady straight
Makin' 'em, gettin' dividend
Got it hot yeah in-between
If them popo's come and get me
Let me out, I'm doin' again
We low, kilo, everythang I worked fo'
Have my girl workin' that corner
Don't come up in this short, hoe
Never seen, you know what I mean
All about that crispy green
Have it sewed up from H-town back to New Orleans
Murder murder if you play me short
Takin' heads clean off this bitch and bustin' hard
Fiends have my block on fire and have me workin' it
And my boys on the corner out there twirkin' it
They twirkin' it
(Chorus and Fade out)"
115,Smartz,1997,The Untouchable (1997),,Scarface,"(VERSE 1: Scarface)
It's been a long time comin'
But now I'm back up in this bitch to hit these niggas with this gangsta shit
I keep the strong rhymes runnin'
My shit don't switch, I'm 10 years in, and ain't changed one bit
It's all about the real, nigga
I keeps it real, nigga
And won't sell out for ??? with Tommy Hilfiger
Fucker, I figure niggas wanna see
The side of society they don't see on TV
So when I bring the shit, I bring the shit like I seen it
And when I scream the shit, I sing the shit like I mean it
No secret, these muthafuckas figure I'm a threat
'Cause I ain't fallin' short to the traps the demon set
Now sweat, cause now I got my head in your books
And when I think 'cracker', my definition read 'crook'
Now look, we're livin' under laws that they set
Back then we were treated like dogs and wasn't shit
And slowly but surely the shit changed
>From they fault, but if you black, then you get blamed
A damn shame, that means this muthafucka's one-sided
And blacks, we get lost in the sauce, because we unguided
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
Get what they can get and rip they assholes apart
They smart
(CHORUS: Devin / (Tony 'Scarface' Montana))
They smart, man
(Those guys...)
You niggas better watch yo ass
(..They're the bad guys)
Them bastards they smart, man
(Those guys...)
It's up to us for how long we gon' last
(..They're the bad guys)"
116,Smile,1997,The Untouchable (1997),,Scarface,":
There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see, that's gon' make it hard to smile in the future.
But through whatever you see, through all the rain and the pain, you gotta keep your sense of humor.
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit.
Remember that.
Mmm, yeah.
So keep ya head up.
Yeah.
Our lifestyles be closed-captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales, for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears, save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve, just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Just smile for me now
:
Smile for me, won't you smile (
)
Just smile (
), smile for me (
)
Smile for me (
)
Won't you smile (
) just smile for me (
)
:
Now as I open up my story, with the blaze o' your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, upon phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy, hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality, we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over foot broad chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now, is collect it and smile
Smile for me, won't you smile
Just smile, smile for me
Smile, for me
Won't you smile, for me
:
Fuck the world as we elope and witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', crooked thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitenturies the best revenge
Is fuck friends, we military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change, and still I smile nigga
:
And now a moment of silence, let us pray.
And as you journey into outer-space, may the angels help to lead the way.
May the prayers that the families made, shine up on your soul to keep you safe.
And all the homies that done passed away, be there to greet you as you pass the gates.
And as you headed to the tunnel's light, I hope it leads to eternal life.
Can we say a prayer for our homie 'Pac?
Smile
(Smile for me)
(All ya need to do is smile)
(Woo smile for me)
(Come on smile for me)"
117,Soldier Story,2008,Emeritus (2008),,Scarface,"Where I'm from killers go dumb, usually death is the outcome
Welcome to the jungle, where kidnappers haunt you
The streets, they really want you
I'm serious, no smile on this block, gives answers if you curious
Good times disappear quickly back into a mist
Shooter hardly ever miss, that means I'm accurate
Crack the pitch man, pretty soon Ima have to switch
Scratchin' the itch with paper cuts on my index
The real riders shoot up blocks and screams who next
Like my nigga two text, he told two text
Done been in beef before but in Houston they call it plex
Gotta know the protocol, I'm warnin' y'all it gets deep
So deep, the prison guards'll put you to sleep
Rest eternally, no comin' back, ya O.D., overdose
This neighborhood got me comatose
Back against the wall, another statistic I know
The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail
I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail
And if I get busted I'm not about to tell
'Cause I'm a gangsta
The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail
I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail
I ain't tryin' to do right, I'm already livin' in pain
'Cause I'm a gangsta
The gas prices too high, the pay raise is too low
I'm better off in the game flippin' kicks like Judo
Or out somewhere pimpin' gettin' money and by the two wholes
That's why I'm at the lab of the product, spittin' you flows
Feds' watchin' my hood, entirely too much gun play
Neighborhood basketball stars slain last Monday
Raided the neighborhood, king pen last Tuesday
If this was goin' on in your neighborhood what would you say?
Given the opportunity to tell it to the masters
Lower middle class still a carryin' bus passes
Young girls givin' birth before they hit the ninth grade
'Bout to be a mom and can't even make Kool Aid
Who made this crack anyway? Told us about the heroin
Sold us alcohol and the guns that we carry 'round
Can't blame us for everything goin' wrong in the States
I don't blame a nigga for nothin' he do to get cake
The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail
I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail
And if I get busted I'm not about to tell
'Cause I'm a gangsta
The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail
I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail
I ain't tryin' to do right, I'm already livin' in pain
'Cause I'm a gangsta
It's like the ghetto's got a heart and a soul, a mind of it's own
A hunger for a young cat to die 'fore he grown
A lust for a young girl to slide down a pole
She's always fallin' short on her goals
The street life is cold, it's either win or lose or you fold
Money is the root to all evils what I was told
When everything you thought you'd believed in was a hoax
You put your faith in front of those demons
And when the smoke clears, the truth appear
The fight for your life, the struggles of a wrong versus right
And wrong won, a song sung in the keys of reality
When death crosses your path, blood shed tragically
So automatically you come to a close and realize
That no matter what we key to the codes
I seen the hood swallow muthafuckas whole
The shit amountin' in the system ain't never make it home, that I know
The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail
I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail
And if I get busted I'm not about to tell
'Cause I'm a gangsta
The streets always been my daddy and mommy is the county jail
I'ma soldier and I'm about my mail
I ain't tryin' to do right, I'm already livin' in pain
'Cause I'm a gangsta"
118,Someday,2002,The Fix (2002),,Scarface,"(Feat. Faith Evans)
**Chorus [Faith Evans]**
I know god is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me
I wanna walk with you, follow in your footsteps
Talk with you to find out where my good's kept
I been gone away from home for so long
Seems like everything I try to do without you go wrong
I'm confused about a lot of things, but not with my fate
So I'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
See I'm a sinner in the 3rd degree
Ain't afraid to admit it, scause I seen niggas worse than me
Who am I to judge a man when I'm a man myself
In the dark, trying to get me some help
I went from pawn to king, king back to pawn
Doing my best to try to ease out the storm
I know that every tunnel's got an end and a light
And I prepared a new beginning in Christ
My life is like a jigsaw dulling in time
And as I'm thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine
**Chorus [Faith Evans]**
I know god is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me
It seems like every other Wednesday I'm attending a wake
But I don't question you, I know that's your way, ok
I know we living for the minute and there's a moment in time
We've got to leave here, cause that's your design
And nothing lasts forever, not even spirit, only your word
That's what I live by, 'cause that's what I heard
I wasn't there when you rose from the dead or parted the sea
I never seen you, but still I believe
How you explain the moon, the sky, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea, the earth without form facing the deep
In darkness challenging the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seas, to make up the trees
So why we turn our backs on the truth?
It's heaven or hell, the point we seem to hide from the youth
And I was singing this morning, got touched by the spirit
So I wrote it down for the homies to hear it
**Chorus [Faith Evans]**
I know god is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me
Lord I know that I've been wrong
They say a man is lost without a prayer, without a song
So I'm singing on my knees 'cause I believe you'll keep me strong
Until it's time for me to bring it home
But until it's time for me to bring it home
I'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood
Even gangsters need to pray, 'cause when I pray it's understood
That I got flaws about myself, I can't make it by myself
I need the heaven's help, I want to follow in your foot steps
Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
And given all his glory to god cause god towers
Over all, and in that I save this prayer
For all my homies that's been trapped out there
That's stuck in their ways, it's different now than back in the days
So fuck what they say, cause ain't no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about
**Chorus [Faith Evans]**
I know god is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

I just want to be your best soul, woo lord"
119,Sorry 4 What?,2000,The Last of a Dying Breed (2000),,Scarface,"Is anybody out there...
(Scarface)
I swear I feel so all alone, back down on my knees again
Hopin you can keep me strong, 'cause I can't hardly sleep tonight
I took too many sleepin' pills, I drunk too many Miller Lites
And I can feel the Reaper near, so please forgive me for my sins
I am just another man, sorry for the pain that I've caused
I know that you'll understand, these demons'll drive me - insane
I've been goin' mad, rightly oughta blow out my brains
'Cause I'm hurtin' bad but I'm fightin... blast, on the other day
These problems got me usin' more drugs, along with the other things
I'm slowly fading into my thoughts, (come against me, bring it on!)
And I'm driftin in and outta space, and I don't believe I'm wakin' up
With the alcohol, them drinks, drift me to another world
Where the sunshine stay shinin, I think I was finna url
Mom, can ya look at me? This ain't what I used to be
Tomorrow, I'll be somebody else, 'cause I ain't been me
I can't seem to shake these, I'll put that there on every day
Boy tryna figure me out, is like Lamar changing
But my childhood was fucked up - raised rowdy by a single moms
She told me my daddy didn't give a fuck, she ain't let him do his job
Seventh grade; failing, and I don't know my next of kin
These days in these fucked up ways, who the fuck are them?
My daddy had three other kids, but I ain't never seen 'em
So, ain't no sense in coming around now, you ain't been here befo'
It's sad but I ain't feelin' nuttin, my whole life's been a fuckin' maze
And when I tried to locate my siblings, they were gone away
Lost inside they other things, fucked me then, fucked me now
Quick to tell me ""Show you some love"" nigga show you Hell
Ain't no love I'm feelin' here, I ain't never felt this vile
Momma - did you really love me, or was I just a child?
Said it, outside, I knew you seen it in my face
I wasn't really happy here, but I was forced to lead the way
Copped me a Cheverolet, drift away to the other side just to think
If I get to see Heaven, I can thank you for the ride
And thank you for my other kids and even though
They mommas won't admit that they can't make it but bad,
Low on the child support - always been bad boo, tryna make me out to be
The bad guy that I really ain't, bitch so quick to hassle me
'Cause I don't see my kids enough, but I make the time to pick 'em up
But you find somethin' to stick in my face - it ain't me fuckin' up
It's bad enough, face to face, always wanna catch a case
So bad, they'll try an get me they make me - and what takes the cake
Is the whole world is fuckin' up, daddy know where the weankess at
And you spoke lies to ya old man's eyes, how could you sleep wit that?
Jepordize everything, just for searchin for larger life
Sacrificin the whole family, with no regards to Christ
Funny how people can take this shit for granted, right?
But then reality strikes, and changes things overnight
I thank the Lord for watchin over me, though I'm prone to doin' wrong
I repent religiously, hopin that the weak get strong
When the heat get's on {*wind blowing*}
Hopin that the weak get strong, when the heat get's on
(Talking - echo after each pause)
Ya know... the street's different... stays as it likes...
Either, headin into a storm... ya in a storm...
Or ya just got out of a storm... (yeah) think about it...

Typed by: escobar188@yahoo.com
This a wake up
(VERSE 1: Scarface)
Ain't nothing like the Sunnyside sunshine (sunshine)
Hitting corners ducking one-time
In my platinum color four dog
Tinted out roll rolls (yeah I roll, roll)
I hit the beach and I say tops down
Girls with they tops down (whistle)
They got bikinis and they thongs on
Dancing to the thong song (thong song)
(CHORUS: Tanya Herron)
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
(VERSE 2: Scarface)
I see that lately that my loves on
Stop at Papa Joes and get my grub on
I ran into my old fling Tasha
Still looking cute but she was knocked up (knocked up)
I'm like ay how you been girl
I see you finna have a kid girl
The funny thing about Tasha (what's that)
Is that she was destined to be knocked up (knocked up)
She twenty-nine and still a cold freak
But she got a baby in the car seat
She wanted to be seen in all the funk spots
Still getting crunk staying drunk huh (drunk huh)
The Friday nights are still the same things
Looking for diamonds and the chrome things (bling, bling)
I'm sitting in my Benz in a nice spot
I bet you want to be my wife huh
(CHORUS: Tanya Herron)
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
(VERSE 3: Scarface)
And I been lonely for a long time
That's why I'm glad the baby ain't mine
Ran up to the door but left my car keys
I went back in the store and I saw Daffany
Lookin' like she did back in eighth grade (eighth grade)
Just like she did back in eighth grade
We used to skip school and do the wild thang
And I'm like daffany was up man
I just got out law school
She said attorney for the criminals
I'm making six figures every six months
She said she had everything a bitch want
And been lookin' for a nigga for her whole life (whole life)
Don't you want to make me your wife? (Uh, uh)
I guess my answer must have stunned her
(I don't think so)
I guess I must have stunned her
(CHORUS: Tanya Herron)
Bye, bye baby
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
I guess I didn't know, I guess I didn't know
I'm calling; I'm calling not anybody just you now baby
Keep your eyes on me baby"

Staring down the barrel of a colt 45
I'm feeling mad suicidal, so I think I'm gonna drive
Everything is hazy and I can't see my lanes
Demons got me seeing double in the rain
If I put the peddle to the metal, take my hands off the wheel
Lord if you hear me, steer, steer
Lord if you hear me, steer
I think I need to breathe 'cause I ain't feeling right
My conscience is at ease saying live your life
Got everything I ain't missin' much, bruh
Got my little paper back I ain't feeling fucked up
My woman got my back so I ain't stressed out
Side looking in, you can say I'm blessed huh
Career still intact got my street cred
Went on with life thinking that the beef's dead
But every now and then I get flash backs
Get down on my knees and I ask that
God keep my head on 'cause I don't wanna spaz out
Load back up that 45 and air a nigga, ass out

Staring down the barrel of a colt 45
I'm feeling mad suicidal, so I think I'm gonna drive
Everything is hazy and I can't see my lanes
Demons got me seeing double in the rain
If I put the peddle to the metal, take my hands of the wheel
Lord if you hear me, steer, steer
Lord if you hear me, steer
Awaken by the sound of the siren
Helicopter spotlights illuminate the crime scene
Crowd gathers round try to find out what the fuck just happened
Wait a minute, time out
I looked a little closer at my t-shirt
I see squirts of blood just now starting to bleed worse
I'm lost I got blood on my hands, though
And then the camera man starts to pan slow
Realizing what I'm up against
I guess I just have to face the consequence
Snap back to reality
I gotta think fast, got some motherfuckers after me
Paranoid, got me running for my life now
Homicide, questioning my mama and my wife now
Parking lot, full of cops, got the dogs out
Running, chest burning, out of breath
About to fall out
Hit the corner, parked car at the stop sign
Going back to jail ain't the plan so the outline
Is to come up with something so I escape this or hand cuffs
Fuck that I ain't gonna take shit
I rather be carried by 6 than judged by 12 getting that cell
Or maybe they gon' gun a nigga down
'Cause they don't wanna see me in the trial
(Rush Davis)
Everything is hazy and I can't see my lanes
Demons got me seeing double in the rain
If I put the peddle to the metal, take my hands of the wheel
Lord if you hear me, steer, steer
Lord if you hear me, steer"

Waken by the sound of my cell phone,
Donny hathaway singing on the ringtone.
Was a homie that I went to school with,
Tellin' me life wasn't shit to fool with.
These young niggas steady dyin' over dumb shit,
Fast money for your soul,
Now your done with.
You hear the gun click.
(Gunshot).
Blood stains on the walls and carpet,
Pain and the hardships
Of a father identifyin' his child
From a photo of the plan,
With his brains blown out now.
Lets rewind to where it all took place,
Started off in math class early that day.
Hey! Its high school,
And everybodys tryin' to earn a rep
And he gone gun shot a homie to death.
The impossible is happenin',
Children are left to make decisions.
Do ya let 'em die or kill them urself?
Choruse (Shateish)
As I look at my life...
Remembering where I've been.
I may not have been here.
Cuda been in the gutter,
Drowning in my tears.
I remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeah)
Everytime you turn around somebody got shot...
Ooh,
But I'm still here.
I'm still here.
Another homie got murdered in the dope house,
Ass pocket full of money,
Chillin' gettin' smoked out.
Two shots hit him in his face when he blast it,
Frame pictured,
And its closed casket.
This is so tragic.
I see death on every block I turn,
Its just not my turn.
Live the same lifestyle,
Cash money to burn.
Weed blowin' steady slippin' in the darkest term.
When it feels like real life,
Knowin' is next.
Rep to take it,
Be the last left,
Humble yourself.
In slow-mo you see your wholse life flashin'
That second from the beginning,
Back to the end and that lesson
Is nothin' short of what a nigga expect.
Livin' life like this,
This is duly respect.
And I refuse to give debt.
As I look at my life...
Remembering where I've been.
I may not have been here.
Cuda been in the gutter,
Drowning in my tears.
I remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeah)
Everytime you turn around somebody got shot...
Ooh,
But I'm still here.
I'm still here.
Yeah I remember,
We tatted are names on our arms for fun.
Writin rest in piece for the dead and gone.
That's just me,
And I ain't the one to stunt,
But seems like I'm losing somebody every other month.
That's why I walk through the hood
Tryin' talk to the hood,
But some niggas is lost in the hood.
And we blind to that fact,
That we actin' like they wanted us to act.
White man versus black.
Reason I ain't vote for my iraqs 'cause I love 'em.
They gonna want him hanged after that.
In god we trust,
What? (what?)
Money or the life of a soldier
Sent to die in the war in a fight,
That never should took place.
Mary K-K-K
Used to be a great place (great place),
Now I guess we save face (save face).
John McCain hates niggas, (hates niggas)
On Martin Lutha King day. (hahahahaha)
Go Figure.
As I look at my life...
Remembering where I've been.
I may not have been here.
Cuda been in the gutter,
Drowning in my tears.
I remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeah)
Everytime you turn around somebody got shot...
Ooh,
But I'm still here.
I'm still here."
125,Street Lights,2006,My Homies Part 2 (2006),,Scarface,"(*Talking*)
That's a set back, you know I'm saying man
Lil' Red, way back in the motherfucking cut man
Nigga was like shit nigga, I was like what come on man
(Scarface)
Street lights are glowing, everyday's another struggle
And moving slowly in silence, steady making sho' my hustle
Is air tight, these city streets is hectic gotta get it here
Tomorrow ain't a promise to me, so I don't live in fear
I work until I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, re-up and that's when I bleed it
The soldier could never see me, as being some'ing that's lesser
A nigga straight out the gutter, murdered without a question
Product of my surroundings, click it clack it and and down him
All they know is he missing, but niggaz ain't never found him
I'm sorry but still in yet, I don't live it on regrets
I'm a motherfucking killer, for realer this ain't a threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets, and my advice to you is live your life
And never when niggaz might, hit you under city lights
So get it right (never know)
You never know when niggaz might, hit you under city lights get it right
Lord forgive me, 'cause I know I ain't living right
Still I gotta make some'ing happen, under them street lights
But pay attention, let me show you what my life like
You can get your days cut short, under them street lights
(Yung Redd)
Them folks got me under the scope, 'cause I ain't living right
Still I ain't the one to provoke, dog you get it right
20 inch shoes when I cruise, under them city lights
Careful with the road I choose, cause you can lose your life
I'm praying and hoping, I never get caught in the moment
Shot from a glock, that's smoking from not scoping
When a nigga told me, you don't work you don't eat
So I'm slanging thangs for cheap, where the streets lights meet
And my pop, was a rolling stone
15 I was grown, 16 I was holding my own
Is it wrong to sell you a dream, or sell you a zone
A long way from home, on this road I roam
Still I'm po'ing the liquor, for niggaz who ain't with us
Ery'body ain't a gangsta, every nigga ain't a killa
Naw but them laws, couldn't tell ya the difference
So pay attention, or find yourself locked in prison this ain't living man
(Lil Ron)
Years have passed, and shit in the hood getting drastic
Two days ago, my homegirl got blasted
That's tragic, happened right on my block
I'm feeling paranoid, laws might run in my spot
So I'm living low key, and them folks don't know me
Slowly I ride through the city, stack mo' cheese
Then I slide out, to the hideout and smoke on
Haters watching, my chest is froze like a snow-cone
But hold on, trash talking ain't my game
Rather pimp me a dame, or switch lanes in a Range
Peep this it ain't a secret, them laws ain't right
They like to catch a late night, living the life
That's why I'm on top of my game, always thinking twice
Don't get it twisted, I still got a mean right
But most of the time, my nigga I'm on chill
It's real in the field, it's easy to get killed"
126,Stuck At A Standstill,2003,Balls And My Word (2003),,Scarface,"Artist: Scarface
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch
These niggas is fuckin' with a dangerous game
Hey Joe, what's up baby?
Yeah, I like the beat
Hahaha...
Hey, when you drop drums I'ma drop rhymes, aight?
(Drop rhymes)
Nah, I don't need no count-off
Just drop the beat and I'm on it, aight?
(2-3-4)
(VERSE 1: Scarface)
I took my chances when I did my dirt
And my advice to any nigga if you crimin, you do it worse
Just get enough and step the fuck back
Cause in this game when you get fame
You gotta start dumpin these agents off your nutsack
I'm just a nigga out the hood tryin' to have things
But when I got up on my feet you're screamin ""Brad changed!""
And your excuse was that the money came
But my excuse was that you missed the plane, simple and plain
I got to show my homies love, though
I just don't fuck around with niggas that I don't know
And you can take that how you wanna take it
I'm from these muthafuckin streets
And the same rules apply in this game, don't ever break it
Ain't my muthafuckin luck I'm all alone at the crack
And you niggas don't wanna try to attack
We steady dyin' over dumb shit, and me, I'm steady losin my sleep
Cause niggas ain't familiar with the rules of the streets
You're stuck
Stuck at a standstill
On the beat one time, come on
It don't stop
Give it to em
...3
(VERSE 2: Scarface)
And to my niggas on the streets crimin (watch for haters)
Stop sittin' on the sidelines and (get your paper)
Too many niggas complainin pointin fingers at the problems
""That's why I hate my baby mama""
I'm just a nigga from the very bottom
Skippin classes, goin' 8 balls or the white powder
Tryin' to get it while the muthafuckin gettin' good
The possibilities of movin out my neighborhood
Don't get me wrong, I had them dreams too
But the only thing you do is get your cream, fool
Get your muthafuckin green, fool
Niggas ain't knowin' 'bout the ins and the outs
First get in, then you get out
Don't be stuck at a standstill
(You know...
To the 2, ah 2-1
(...I was thinkin')
Rock the mob shit for niggas, come on y'all
(...Need to, I don't know, maybe findin new hustles
Like niggas is runnin' out of hustles, you know?)
(VERSE 3: Scarface)
When it's over don't nobody cry
Just enjoy it while you live life cause everybody gotta die
So when you see me I'll be hella high
Bendin corners with my top down checkin' out the changes in the sky
Shootin paper clips at Jupiter
The mo' I learn it's like I'm gettin' stupider, and stupider
Tryin' to make the best out of a fucked up decision
I'm just a nigga with a vision, which is
Gettin' up, gettin' out, gettin' my profits
Tryin' to stay away from these bitches that jock dick
Movin up to move on, gotta stay true to it
That's just the way you gotta do it
And these niggas here is renegades, don't give a fuck
But if you're real, then you like it rough, nigga what?
You know it, you know what I'm sayin' is real
Now step the fuck off all those standstills
'Cause you're stuck
Stuck at a standstill
Stuck
To the beat one time
Yeah
My nigga Mike Dean"
127,Sunshine,1997,The Untouchable (1997),,Scarface,"He wanted drama so I brought him pain
Wadadadang
Listen to my nine millimeter go bang
Out goes your brains; feel the motherfuckin terror
And you ain't felt the comin' of death like this ever
You paused; and now I got a Colt 45
Semiautomatic explodin between your eyes; surprise
You never thought your yesterdays would come back to haunt you
But believe me, I've come back to haunt you
I'm bout to bring your dog days to you mista
Cause rules in the streets you come off we come get ya
And hit ya'; and I done let you slide a few times
But eventually you gots to die in due time

Everybody needs

My life, my life, my life
His mama must've got the news
The little boy that she gave birth to was on of them niggas they pulled
Out the room
And all my other little homies stood shocked
While they watched my other little homie bleed non-stop
On the other side of sorrow is a father being torn
Apart by the sight of his son's lying in the morgue
He mourned 'cause now he got to deal with the fact
That his child is gone and tears can't bring him back
Turn on the TV and seen the unabomber
I flew to D.C., still they got no karma
And everybody say they think it's all gonna change
You paint me pictures, but they all look the same
Its strange, I'm standin in my own frame of thought
Remainin in the street game framin which I was taught
I was taught to always keep my eyes open wide
Cause in these streets you got to ride or you die
I've seen a child born and I've seen a man die
Can't live forever and I understand why
So when your time comes will you crawl or be brave
And in between judgement will you fall or be saved
Sunshine
Tears rolled town his face as he stared at his potna
With his chest full of holes and his head full of coppa
Broke his ass off something propa; he's in the morgue
With his brains in a shitbag and a toetag on-gone
This motherfucka must've thought he was a cat
And had nine lives but ended up on his back
And then the reaper came and took control of your mind
And you can't think you got a hole in your mind
You dyin' and can't nobody bring you out your coma
When this nigga brought the end and turned the lights out for ya
See ya and I wouldn't want to be in your position
Cause starin' the shaft of a strap and you the mission
Means one thing you let a mothafucka catch you on the sneak tip
And put your ass off in some deep shit; got the deep six
And everybody sad sendin' flowers to your ceremony
They lost their motherfuckin' homey
Damn Audi 5 on some dumb shit
And motherfuckers steady riskin their safety behind this dumb shit
But I refuse to give a nigga mine
I give a nigga nine"
128,The Diary,1994,The Diary (1994),,Scarface,"(Say, Face ... nigga, I think I can fade you now)
What, fade me how?
(Sheeit, on this rap shit)
Come on, nigga...
I brought my chopper and my hard hat
The shit's fucked up now show a nigga where the war at
'Cause I'm about to clean house
Stick this a.k. up your ass and blow that fucker clean out
Cause you niggas in the wrong
You came up short and now we fin to get it going on
I ain't your average motherfucker
You step out of line and watch a motherfucker bust ya
Cause you done came at me the wrong way
I ain't no Clint Eastwood, nigga, and you done picked the wrong day
So bring your ass to the battleground
Rat-a-tat-tat, like that is how my gat'll sound
Avoid no niggas cause niggas be human
I squeeze the trigger and niggas be moving
'Cause I don't point it in the air and pull the trigger (why?)
I'd rather point it at your ass and watch the nigga die
I gives a fuck about your team mates
When it's all said and done you're gonna wish you never seen 'face
You shoulda seen that lil nigga Brad
James through here, seen Dave and, yo that nigga bad
And your homies better stand still
Don't make my brother Warren bust one of you bitches cause the man will
Don't bring your ass to my picnic
'Cause I done had it up to here with all you niggas talking that bitch shit
So you better get your shit right
I'm from the state where you rarely see a motherfucking fist fight
It's all about the gun blast
So you can miss me with that bullshit you spitting with your punk ass
It's the diary of a born killer
Don't have to worry about me falling off this thang 'cause I'm a strong nigga
Doubt my regard of the hard
With niggas behind me from East Oakland to the South Park
I've got the mind of the man right behind ya
You can run, you can hide but I'll still find ya
Like I say there's no getaway
And I'm gon' have it where your family'll have to throw your shit away
It's the return of the real niggas
I'm prejudiced to a certain extent but still I kill niggas
I'll bust that ass on the fucking double
So push on with that ho shit, bitch, cause you don't want trouble
So get your ass up of my shoestrings
And let your shermed nigga do things
Ay, ay, ay where you fin to go, fool?
(I can't fuck with it, you got it, man)
Come on, man ... you wanna rap, nigga?
(I can't do it) Come on
You see, you see! That's how motherfucker is, dogg

Makin' them bullshit caps, bitch I'll ruin your career

And I'll destroy a slew of you niggaz, one at a time

And we slanged by to see were my house was
Started stealing out of my mama's perce
Now that she's gone
She lives thrue my songs

I couldn't have treated her worse then in the ghetto
And turn our womens into wideows
Sick to see my homie that I ain't with, trade with, paid with, laughed with
Dead in a casket.

But you got a chance to get of the pop

Just waking up I gotta thank god
Fired up a square, that's how my day starts
Early mornin' buzzin' got me lookin' at life
Outside I see movin' bitches look at the lights
It's just another Saturday it seems like
Got dressed and hit the corner with my team right
Smoke it, roll it up and pass it around
Now I'm stoned and my ass is barely draggin' the ground
No sooner than you think I would've thought of
A cop walks over, never saw him
""Excuse me, mister officer man, I wasn't tryna disrespect""
And started coughin' again
Eyes red as a bandana
And one time heavy on his antenna
At his request they sent a squad car
And then they put my black ass behind bars

Oh, sittin' on this concrete couch, just waitin'
For the judge to say that I'm gon' be free today
Oh, sittin' in this concrete box, just sayin'
It's been a shitty day, can't find no other words to say
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Scarface)
Fingerprinted and gettin' booked in
They fed a nigga [?], so I took ten
'Cause I'm knowing that I'll be sittin' here the whole night
Empty trunk tank, it's finna be a cold flight
I finally come up on some housin'
Old celly, so I'm bettin' me a thousand
And plus I got a bottom bunk pass
Boss came in with his punk ass
Talkin' to a nigga like it's date time
Askin' where I'm from, I'm from H-town
Niggas askin' me what I'm in for
Nosy motherfuckers want some info
I tell him, ""Dog, I ain't done shit
You know these redneck crackers think they run shit.""
It's lights out, I tie my mat down
Chuck it on the rack and stretch my ass out

It's court call in the halls
Strip a nigga down to his balls
Bare-butt, naked in my tennis shoes
The nighttime sergeant want an interview
They push us out like livestock
""Ain't no talkin' while I'm talkin', this is my block""
I finally get to see me a judge
I'm a black man, so she got a grudge
Old bitch full of race hate
And a nigga quick to represent the gray state
I ain't got a lawyer, I don't need one
Give me thirty days, you get three one
I ain't tryna piss in a jug, bitch
Just because I'm black, I get fucked with
Babe, if I had been a white dude
I'd have never been arrested, look at Michael
And even if I swam like a fish, though
They still would've threw me in the Crisco
And fried a nigga's ass in some hot grease
I'm just tryna get my ass out the hot seat"

Of a dying breed
I don't remember much about bein born
But I do remember this: I was conceived on February 10th
Complications detected in my early months of ballin
Around my sonargram you could see the evil was swarmin
The hassle, was it what the world was seekin' in a child?
The doctors wanted me out, my mama's in denial
Then I kicked her and gently rubbed my hands across her stomach
Told her: ""Keep 'em off me, mama, I'm comin', I'm comin""
Now I guess I musta been the reason mama couldn't sleep
Interrupted her peace, but it was time for me to eat
And since carryin me caused all that swimmin in your feet
Just know that I'm thankful, I'll let you feel it with my heartbeat
All the doctor visits and physicians movin me around
You could sense my discomfort in every other ultrasound
And I'm runnin' out of room in here, steady slidin down
Then she opened up her legs and pushed me out (pushed me out)
(Nigger, nigger never die
Blackface, shining eye)
When I awoke I recall them walkin' out my nose
Screamin at the top of my lungs, freezing cold
Wrapped me up in blankets after dressing me in clothes
Then I met the ???? that I owed
At 3 o'clock, what-what, nine seven o
Was the birth of a dying species, and this I know
The truth was in my bloodline, planted in my seed

134,The Pimp,1991,Mr. Scarface Is Back (1991),,Scarface,"I like pussy, pussy's got me crazy
Well-shaped, light skinned, clean lady
Slapped me on a rubber my brother
And dived straight for the covers
One leg down one leg up
That's the way I like to fuck
I can feel in them guts
And I'm done once I bust me a nut
You can even suck it baby
Dick suck just drive me crazy
Aw yeah, suck it fast
Now wet your tongue and slide it across my ass
Lick the cum from my dick
Whoooh Yeah, that's it.
Now turn over on your stomach
Open up, and let me run it
Dead in that ass, bitch
This is what I call fuckin' shit
""Ooh shit, brad""
Loosen up, and it won't hurt so bad
I like to fuck till the rubber smokin'
Switch up and keep on strokin
Bitches walk out the crib with a limp
'Cause I'm the motherfuckin pimp
...Yeah this goes ou to the entire rap alot family all the motherfuckin pimps
I was kinda lonely last week
So I called up this bad-ass freak
The bitch had a man and three kids
I just wanted to fuck and that's exactly what we did
I guess her husband ain't packin
'Cause the bitch damn sure is fuckin' action
But what he don't know won't hurt him, shit
'Cause see, I don't love that bitch
All I want to do is get a dick sucked
And a real quick nut
Knocked on my door at ten thirty
The first thing she said was don't hurt me
I cracked a little smile and just laughed
And got dead in that ass
I had the bitch screamin bloody murder
My next door neighbours even heard us
But I ain't give a fuck, my brother
The bitch shouldn't've came by to let me fuck her
Pulled it out and laid it on her chest
And put her titties to the test
I made her hold it snug like a glove
I had to get a little dikie love
Yeah that's like butt-fuckin'
Then a real good dick suckin
The whole neighbourhood heard us
But ay yo I didn't pay for my service
One more bitch with a limp
'Cause I'm the motherfuckin pimp
To all the bitches I claimed to love

135,The Suicide Note,2007,Made (2007),,Scarface,"(Scarface)
I took my chances, but I did my dirt
And my adivce to any nigga if you crime, then you do the works
Its givin' up and step the fuck back
'Cause in this game you can fame
You gotta start dumpin these niggas off your nut-sack
I'm just a nigga out the hood tryna have thangs
When I got up on my feet and screamed the brand change
And your excuse was that the money did came
My excuse was that you was to blame
Simple ??, got to show my homies love tho
I just don't fuck around with niggas that I don't know
And you can take that how you wanna take it
I'm from these motherfuckin streets,
And the same rules apply in this game
You never break it
With my motherfucking luck, fallin' over the craps
And you niggas who wanna try to attack
We steady dyin' over dumb shit, And me I'm steady losin my sleep
'Cause niggas ain't familiar with the rules of the street, and it's a
Suicide, it's a Suicide
Suicide, it's a Suicide
It's a, Suicide, it's a Suicide
Suicide, it's a Suicide
(Scarface)
To my niggas on the street cryin then (watch them haters)
If I'm sittin' on the side-line (get your paper)
Too many niggas complaining pointin fingers at the problem
That's why I hate my baby momma
I'm just a nigga from the very bottom
Skippin classes, throwin' 8-balls into white powder
Tryna get it, while the motherfuckers gettin' good
Wit possibilities of gettin' out my neighborhood
Don't get me wrong, I had them dreams too
But the only thing you do, is get your cream too
Get your motherfucking cream fool
Niggas ain't know about the Ange and the Alicks
First you get in, then you get out, you stuck in this game
(Scarface)
Now when it's over don't nobody cry
Just enjoy while you live life, 'cause everybody got to die
When you see me I'll be hella high, beatin' corners wit my top down
Checkin' out the chasers in the sky, Shootin paper clips at Jupiter
The more I lie, it's like I'm gettin' stupider and stupider
Tryna make the best, out of a fucked up desicion
I'm just a nigga with a vision, which is to get up, get out
Gettin' my props, tryna stay away from these bitches that jock dick
And move enough to move on, gotta stay true to it
That's just the way you gotta do it
And these niggas here is really, dazed and don't give a fuck when you for real
And you like it rough, nigga what, the fuck
Know what I'm sayin' is real, now back the fuck up for you get killed
'Cause it's a...
Suicide"
136,The Wall,1993,The World Is Yours (1993),,Scarface,"So Brad, tell me what's going on in your world?
Verse one:
Its fucked up, I'm looking at myself in the mirror
I'm seein' something scary, its slowly coming clearer
I had a funny feeling that today will be the day
That someone tries to blow my motherfucking ass away, but hey
I'm running out of time to be blunt
I never had the nuts to make the motherfucking final cut
I've been depressed for no fucking reason
But every problem's got a reason; I'm kinda havin' trouble breathin'
Somebody help me, hear my plead, my battle cry
My psychic told my that it's gonna be hard for Brad to die
She told a lie, I think I oughtta shank the bitch
I got my pistol, thinking if I should shoot the shit
Click, bang, I jammed it, I slammed it
Aw shit, goddammit
I'm havin' a fucked day to begin with
I lost a bitch, a bird, and then this
My homies tend to think I get too high
I'm doing fine, now pass me the formaldahyde
The only thing that seems to help me cope
Is when I'm drunker than a motherfucker puffin' on the chronic smoke
And then I'm able to deal with the woes
The friends, the foes, the bitches, the hoes
I gotta gang of niggers, but none of them I'd fuck
I gotta gang of bitches, but none of them I'd trust
Trust a bitch, nope, uh-uh, never
I'm havin' too much trouble tryin' to keep my damn self together
They got me by the balls
So please, help me break these motherfucking...
(Pause)
These motherfucking walls
Verse two:
I scream, there's no one there to hear me cry
I guess its hard to scream to motherfuckers when you scream inside
I see my future and its coming in in plain view
I blame myself, but mommy dear I blame you
Cause the world was fucked from the first
And havin' me only made the matters worse
Now look at what they did to me
That's some fucked up shit for a kid to see
Motherfuckin' dealin' after dealin', killin' after killin'
I'm tryin' to check a million
The world's going straight to fuckin' Satan
A fucking shank's about to blow my fuckin' brain
Verse three:
Shit, damn I'm dead
I'm finally through hearing all these voices in my head
Somebody finally got me
I'm looking at my self outside of my fucking body
So now I'm standing face to face
Mr. Scarface, versus Mr. Scarface
We were two different people from the start
One nigga's too smart the other too fucking hard
We both refused to be outsmarted
Dearly departed, the battle's already started
Fuck it, its on, I duck, I weave, connect, oh shit, I'm struck
Caugt me with the peircing lead
And realized to myself I shot my own fucking self
Damn, suicide is quicker
I try to break the wall the wall keeps getting thicker
I really start to miss my mother
I try to climb the wall, its higher than a motherfucker
I wondering what that sound is
I'm having major trouble trying to walk around it
There ain't no getting up I'm trapped
I really should've dropped my motherfucking strap
'Cause when I think about it now
I shouldn't have tried to climb the motherfucker
(Pause)
I should've broke the motherfucker down"
137,The White Sheet,1994,The Diary (1994),,Scarface,"Rat tat tat tat to your ass is the motherfucking flo'
Here comes the White Sheet.
Rat tat tat tat to your ass is the motherfucking flow
Now what is you fuckin' wit a nigga fo?
Apparently you haven't heard of me?
It's going to take more motherfuckers than in the compound to murder me
I fucks a vision like a sand shower
You going up against a stacked deck nigga, now where your man power
Bring your motherfucking backup
And blow the bugle when I step off this bitch and load this gat up
Cause still a nigga's friend will bust you
Dead in your head from the front and knock the back up off that motherfucker
Now listen to the gunshot
I got that ass with that double barrel one shot
Now I don't hear your heart beatin'
Now I don't see your boy breathin', rat tat tat tat.
What's up boy? Ah, ah, wassup Face 1?/where that nigga at? Ah, he back
There in that emergency room, he dead? I, I don't know man fun to bust
This bitch again.
I see your mama in the waiting room standing crying
I see your ass in the doctors arms slowly dying
Now talk that shit that you was talking to your homie
Bitch you should have shot me when you pulled your fucking pistol on me
So now I'm forced to pop the clip in
S to the motherfucking A, nigga set tripping
It ain't no love when my finger's on the trigger
It ain't no love for you off balance ass niggas
So keep your ass in the neutral spot
'Cause if you rolling through my hood when we're feuding then you
Getting got.
I ain't your motherfucking homeboy
You out of pocket when you fucking with me, so now it's on boy
I ain't but in to get my shit like these other busters
When you see me around this bitch I got that motherfucker
So I ain't fucking with the club life
I'm like Pac, I'm making mail but I still live the thug life
My rap name's getting bigger
But ain't nothing changed I still got the game to handle all you bitch niggas
So a nigga's always strapped
Nuts been big since a kid you motherfucker so it ain't rap
Toe to toe, back to back, gat for gat,
It's like that motherfucker, rat tat tat tat."

I'm old school O.G. niggas know me
From slanging' eightballs uncooked to moving whole keys
Now why these niggas wanna test my skills
I'm a killa and I chastise steel
To mix and mingle with this millionaire status
And send a mutha fucker to hell when he fuck with Brad-it's
The killer instinct that never left me
The southside still true to the game little lefty is back
Wit shit that mutha fuckers can't fade
Rhyming but still you mutha fuckers ain't paid
So how can one try to see the unseen
Before you step your ass to the square know one thing
It's closed curtain we leavin' mutha fuckers hurtin'
It's Rap-a-Lot Mafia life we all workin'
Punk we shut you down before you get it started
You can hate it but I'm goin' get mines and that's regardless- bitch

Lotion and magazines is what I'm left wit

To the toilet
And laced my palm wit honey and almond
But suddenly the phone rings
And it's K.B.
Pussy just came through
Some for him and some for me
Hell yeah, I'll be there to help you fuck 'em
Get 'em drunk, get 'em high
Pull they titties out and suck 'em
(K.B.)
Don't rush 'em

Impatiently, waitin' for some dick that's swole

Nobody knows
So just drank and smoke this dank
And let's fuck these hoes
Show 'em what they pussy made for (2X)"
142,Voices,2015,Deeply Rooted (2015),,Scarface,"The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
It's like I have been living a lie
It's beautiful huh the way I can keep it inside
I'm settled in somebody's dream
Seeing through one of his eyes
Pieces of somebody's mind
Pictures of thoughts in the frame
I stand alone in the dark now
Sad and crippled and shamed
I loaded my pistol and aimed
Cocked it quick and then bang
Woke up in sweat feeling the death
Creates an eclipse in the brain
Sometimes I think I'm insane
I hear the voice when I'm asleep
Whispers my name again and again
This is what's she's singing to me
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Sometimes I just want to cry
We kiss in the rain
She is speaking to me once again
Hands in my ear
But this isn't clear
I listen but nothings explained
This is a lie
A feeling inside
I still often drift when I drive
The tears they leave burns on my cheeks
Motionless mirrors with eyes staring me down
A view of a soul
The heart of a woman is cold
My conscious is weak
She making me weak
The only love I've ever known has left me alone
And I'm dying inside
The only thing left is my pride
The pain you hear in my rhyme
For happiness I'll never find
All in my mind
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
I think I've finally failed at something
I honestly believe that
Cause looking at us from outside
You would think we would take better care of our hearts
I died when you did mentally
Spiritually?
I'm numb I feel nothing
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips"

Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... you better watch ya step...
And ya don't stop, so I guess it's on once again
The Natural Born Killaz in a zone again
I'm different type of special men not known to man
I refuse to lose, I was born to win
A street nigga, the stand up type, never to fall
I've been programmed to run in and get it, take it all
Sit back and capitalize off mistakes you made
Beat yo ass into submission, and make you pay
I got battlescars from fuckin' with this, I gotta have it
What's my reason for quotin this shit? I gotta have it
Like the Roy Jones - you see this money get me hungry like a wolf
And when a nigga hungry I'm a wolf
That's when I start my rage, and attack from the neck up
Catch you being careless, make these hoes respect us
Survival here, that's the name of the game
It's the jungle in this bitch and ain't a damn thing changed
Watch ya step
Let's get it on y'all, to the beat y'all
Fuck a bitch y'all, I'm from the streets dawg
So what it is huh? What it look like?
I'm a G fool, you the bitch type
You got yo strap dawg, I got a strap too
I'm from the Southside, we act a damn fool
You ain't the real hoe, youse a real hoe
I keeps it real hoe, for real though
Listen close to the story I'm about to tell
Niggaz is sellin they soul for an ounce of yell'
And a few leave, but this is a house of jail
Twenty-five year bids, without the bail
I know some niggaz in the tank, stuck, lost and thowed
Still boss turnin' ya status from false to hope
Only a few niggaz stand up strong and don't whine
When the time get passed around huh?
I'm tellin' you dawg, that even if you gettin' released
How the fuck is you gon' live on these streets?
You got that jacket on ya back
You a rat and you done spilled ya guts
You a bitch and now you live to fuck
And you a nigga I ain't even gotsta feel to touch
I got some niggaz on the inside to stick and seal you up
It's all good for you out here, gettin' yo mail
But the minute you get popped you gonna snitch in jail
Watch ya step
They say that music is a therapy to ease the mind
But see therapy to me, is to squeeze a nine
Right between ya eyes, while I squeeze ya throat
Chuck you off the side of my boat and watch you float
The animal they sent here to seal ya fate
Tie ya hands behind ya back and feel ya face
Ain't no hope for ya partner Joe, he broke the rules
In the jungle if ya weak, we gotta smoke ya fool
Ain't no love for motherfuckers who done crossed the line
Cocked dice don't pay nigga, now roll ya five
You wanna play the gun game with me, then pull ya shit
I know you'd love to try to punk me if you could ya bitch
But I'm a diehard nigga, I was sworn to silence
And if I got to go, then I (?)
So fuck you, and them niggaz that you run with fool
I'll do the same shit to them, that I did to you
Watch ya step"
144,We Out Here,2006,My Homies Part 2 (2006),,Scarface,"Ghetto slave, U.T.P.
Ya heard me? Aiyyo Nick, show 'em
Everything was gravy till the hurricane popped up
Then the levees broke and had the whole city stopped up
Then it got hectic, everybody split up
But a lot of us sittin' in Texas nigga we out'chea
Downtown, we out'chea, uptown, we out'chea
Niggaz that stayed home, you think they dead? Out'chea
Heron City, all bustin' heads, out'chea
Niggaz with real charges duckin feds? Yo we out'chea
(Verse One)
Most likely you saw Eazy in Texas
Trashback his brass real fast for a Lexus
The Southwest side, best to be seen
Tuesday night break his ass shake and sip the lean
And if not, catch us on the Northside, take 610
59 it's a short ride, holla somethin' out'chea
Whylin in the front with the blunts 'cause we out'chea
Hopin they don't have to figure out what we bout'chea
3rd Ward, 4th Ward, 5th Ward - we out'chea
6th Ward, 7th Ward, 8th Ward - we out'chea
9th Ward, 10th Ward, 11th Ward - we out'chea
12th Ward, 13th, 17th - we out'chea
(Verse Two)
I ran up into Barstow, took the nursing home bus
The feds pulled us over but they didn't really fuck with us
Causeway to I-10, bad roads, Lafeyette
{??} Took a two month rest
Went from the shorts to the projects, the ones in the hilltop
I like it in the hood but that wasn't my bus stop
I made it out to Dallas, mob pimpin', sippin lean
Saw some niggaz from the home team, that I ain't seen
In a month or two, fucked up a blunt or two
But I left, 'cause I gotta do, what I gotta do
E hit me hard as I'm jettin, it was powerful
Now I'm out of Houston, and Crophead's been doin' our producin (yeah)
(Verse Three)
Yeah I'm in Houston but you know that
Nigga like me, old school, new always like a throwback
And when they build it I'ma go back
For now I'm out'chea, you ain't seen the FUCK YOU on my do'mat?
You read my license plate, mad motherfucker
So you know the driver is a bad motherfucker
Swerved on the A-Town, exit off the {?}
Plus my homey from the hood done relocated uphill
And he tellin' me, how good that the weed is
The numbers on the hustle, and how we both can bleed it
I'm addin it up and it's just like what I needed
The sweetest hustle ever, of a hustle if I seen it"
145,What Can I Do?,2002,The Fix (2002),,Scarface,"(Feat. Kelly Price)
(Kelly Price)
What can I do?
What can I do, to make it better?
Yeah, yeah
(Scarface)
I thank the Lord, for every morning, he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining, there's a cloud in the sky
Lettin' me know, that at any moment, there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is, there still can be pain
Down the park, I hear the sirens, just screamin' away
And then the unevitable happens, the end of them days
As sad as it sounds, but that's the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth, will taketh away (will taketh away)
I live and I learn, I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash, it remindes me of the now and the passed
I say a little prayer, 'cause eventually I'll stand in the path
Of the souls and dark rows that lead to rest
Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears (someone like you and me)
Take away their fears
And then a child is born
Bloody legged, clingin' to life
Unaware of his surroundin's or breathin' is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams (baby's alive)
At the same time, another mother, murders her kids
And the unbarable thought of this hear, just' brings me to tears
It's hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith, and killin' your pearls
And sometimes, I sit it down, and wonder myself
But then again, I ain't Jesus, and I can't help
All I can do, is hope I never live with the fact
That if I heard one of my seeds is dealin' with that
That'd be the hardest thing, I'd ever have to do in my time
I'd have to take my own life too, and I couldn't glide
Instead what he'd, what you hear me singin' 'bout it in my ride
And a parent hurtin' his kid ain't decidin' the time
I know it's truth, the next day, we just livin' to die
But I believe if you livin' right, you'll live in the sky
Lookin' down on the good and the bad, the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did, before you had to go
Do you hear them, crying?
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(Someone to dry their tears) Take away their fears
Can I make it, better? (I want to make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through? (they're through)
What can I do?
What can I do?
I say ""goodbye"" to your cruel world
I see peace to the red sky
I see these are where the dead die, leavin' my head high
And if the streets up ahead crowd with the heat from the lead fly
But the grief when I said ""Bye,"" pull the sheets on my bed dry
We're turnin' the table, we tellin' a tale
That the destruction of human flesh, and it not so great
Long list of the John Doe's, and Kauntly the spirit
With them jails of souls lost, we hope that God hears it
Resurection very harsh, crowdin' in the room
Muffle sounds on the outside, echo the tomb
But I'm cold
(Kelly Price)
Do you hear me?
I'm cryin'
Do you hear them, crying? (x2 to fade)
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
(Someone to dry their tears)
Take away their fears (take away their fears)
Can I make it, better? (gonna make it better)
Can I ease the pain that they are goin' through?
(Everything they're goin' through) What can I do?
What can I do?"
146,Who Are They,2008,Emeritus (2008),,Scarface,"Huh
You see a nigga with his game tight, money with a name like
'Face (Face Mob), havin' his way, the homie did his thing, right?
You just a peon, the type of bitch I'd pee on
High sidin a nigga, rollin' in a Neon, now what the fuck was she on?
I'm ""Prime Time"" bitch like Deion (yeah)
I Spinks on a ho like Leon
And you are just a castaway, so get your ass away
Instead of fuckin' you, I'd masturbate
I shouldn't of had to wait, I think you blew your big chance
You rejected when I asked about the eighth grade dance
Now I'm big time, like my homeboy Randy
Plus I'm pushin a Porsche with drop top panties
It's just like candy but I ain't hammy
Yo ho, so yo, ass can't hand me
Shit, fuck your cell phone bitch, you can keep that
Broke, you ain't know a motherfucker, where was she at?
I think I remember you, from way back when, but how can I be sure?
That's so long ago and since then we both have grown
But look at you, you're amazin
What's so, crazy, I know how niggaz do
'Cause they get money, change and don't remember who they are
Listen, in high school with the females, I was rarely selected
I got rejected by the ones the damn nerds rejected
If I wore a shirt Monday, this is true, I ain't lyin'
By the end of the week you probably saw it two more times
I was discouraged by the microscopic size of my bank
But stayed constantly motivated to rise in the ranks
I used to be a bottom feeder, lowest man on the totem
But I showed a mass like the transit sit on my scrotum
Gettin' fed by my music and it's all clean work
And the used to be prom queen is a Walgreens clerk
I would dream about bein with ya, wantin to kiss on ya
Now I let my damn bladder bust before I piss on ya
Me and 'face second to none, makin' records for fun
You thirty-seven at the strip club gettin' naked for ones
But I ain't trippin', you can hit the room with me, it's fine
And when I bust one on her chin, I'm like ""clean up on aisle nine!""
(Yeah)
(Chorus - Unknown Female)
I think I remember you, from way back when, but how can I be sure?
That's so long ago and since then we both have grown
But look at you, you're amazin
What's so, crazy, is I know how niggaz do
'Cause they get money, change and don't remember who they are
Thugga, huh
A (Bitch Ain't) never been (Shit) to me
I've been screamin that since ""Chronic"" popped back in '93
Back when I was broke in the hood on my ass
I couldn't get away when the bitch drove past
Now a nigga seein cash so fast, things change
Same bitch askin for a ride in the Range
Lookin' at a nigga strange, 'cause I ain't tryin' to entertain
Conversation about her becomin my main
I'm like ""bitch, you must of fell and bump your brain
And think you fuckin' with a lame, nope not me mayne
I ain't got shit for ya, matter fact, I don't know ya
That's all I'm a show ya, 'cause that's all a nigga owe ya
Used to be fine, big titties and behind
Had a few kids, now your belly bigger than mine
Stomach lookin' like you had a fight with a lion
I ain't fuckin' with you bitch, move around""
I think I remember you, from way back when, but how can I be sure?
That's so long ago and since then we both have grown
But look at you, you're amazin
What's so, crazy, is I know how niggaz do
'Cause they get money, change and don't remember who they are (they are, they are ...)"
147,Who Do You Believe In,2007,Made (2007),,Scarface,"What uuup!?
This past year was a rough ride, joking aside
A lot of niggas left to do bids, and most done died
My neighborhood is like a ghost town
Would hype some trash
The BGs got the hood hot
With whites and rats
The old folks is mad at us 'cause they kids is lost
How you expect for us to teach when all you did was talk
The trickledown theory but this generation of thugs
Ain't nothing like my niggas was when was hustling blood
It went from weed to cocaine
Cocaine to drank
Drank to handlebar, heron, x and crank
Smokin' dip, plottin homicies, killin' theyself
Butt naked waving pistols round the feeling of death
Got mama crying, 'cause she know deep down they needin her help
But he's a dead man walking, still she pray for his health
Why did Cory have to die young
I'm losing my friends
Fought the war against Cancer
But he lost in the end
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Outside I see the cop cars flashin they lights
Raindrops symbolizing God is saving the life
The sun shining so they say the devil beatin' his wife
The body bloody underneath the sheet is waitin for Christ
The streets is hungry so I know they watchin
Waitin to strike/ But anything you ever got for easy
Came with a price/ Its just the chance a niggga took
He was shaking the dice/ Committed suicide to get his chain covered in ice
I ain't gon lie I did the same thing
I wanted to shine
25 and had a drop Rolls
Top of the line
I came a long way from rockin' up
Ounces or dimes
To moving big boys
4 or 5 blocks at a time
And since this rap it wasn't paying bills
I did what I did/ Got my money for it
Let these niggas see how I live
Wrong answer
You'd think a motherfucker be proud
To see his homie on his feet instead of talking him down.
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Now if the ghetto ever made a change
It changed for the worse
But I love it so I write in tears
And pray till it hurts
Prick my fingers
Till the blood stains would cover the page
Wipe my eyes and look ahead
And hope to see better days
I turn my TV off
'Cause I don't wanna look at the news
Hard times seeing people crying
Arabs and Jews
Fighting for they religion
Niggas livin' like niggas
Mexicans on the border
White boys saying kill em
Politicians playing puppet
Gotta answer me this
Do you believe you really God?
My answer is this
Did you say
Let there be light, give Adam his wife?
Produce the vegetation
Separate the day from the night?
Create the land and the sea and man in your own image
If not, then I want all this bullshit ended
Sending the kids to fight a war
That they ain't have to be in
Ask Saddam, shit is dead
Lets see you fuck with them Koreans
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?"
148,"Win, Lose Or Draw",1998,My Homies (1998),,Scarface,"(Feat. Johnny P., DMG and Lo-Ke)
Win... Lose... Draw... Die
Scarface:
I read the book of Revalations
And now I realize we in revalations
And on that note I make this statement
For all the young guns to become one to die young
Because the world is filled with hatred
And they aim to blame our sons
And I done seen down the barrel of a strap before
But I don't wanna die no mo', I fear the reaper
Help us Jesus, help to keep us away from all the sadness
And deliver us from the hate that cause the madness
I'm glad its installed in me from day one
Believe in something because most of my homies believe in nothing
And paying for it, God bless your souls, I'll be praying for it
Eventually you'll have your day in court
And I done been a witness to homocide
Seen a whole family die
Before the stones of diamonds in the sky
Through my bloodshot eyes feel the hurt and all the hate
That I've trapped inside because the hurtin' hard to ache
There's a smile on my face
But, that's to keep a man from crying
Cause deep down inside, I know I'm dying
I'm born for it, gon' take some time to getting used to
And Satan I know that your listening but I rebuke you
And refuse to let you capture me and kill my will
Just to survive the game of life, win or lose
Do or die, refuse to let you capture me to kill my will
To survive the game of life, win or lose, do or die
Chorus (Johnny P):
(2X)
Whether we win or lose this life to do or die
But sometimes we lose the will to win and wonder why
DMG:
Open my hands like a book
Years and years me and my notebook
I take a close look
Peep it dread see myself failing
A felon on the verge of 1-8-7
But I ain't ever wanna do it
'Cause homocide never solved it,
Just momentarily resolved it
We've all been involved in the calling of a loved one
Oldest ones the young ones the smartest one the dum-dums
And not begun with some
And they all probably died with none by the gun
That's on the one, two, three and the fo's for life
I slap five on the black hand side
I realize the future lies among my two sons and daughter
So I pray to God just for tomorrow
In lieu of the drama I move my momma
But the poverty's prolonging the pain
Plugging my arteries and veins with strains
When I lose in this game
Lo-Ke:
12/11/73, a young little huster was born
Torn from my momma's womb in the midst of the storm
Never warned I was going through a world of stress
Never knew that I was born for death, may God bless
My pops died when I was thirteen, I'm still tripping
Forget living, I'm on a suicidal mission
Tears dripping from my eyes as I look up at the sky
Asked the higher power why my old man had to die
It was hard to say goodbye I tried to hide what I feel
Forget the wife forget the will (naw, chill; naw, chill)
I'm at your gravesight, latenight trying to figure out
Would I see your smiling face if I commence to dig you out
I'm all about the cheese, I plan to see you once again
But I can't make through the night without committing a sin
I had to realize there wasn't no friends, backstabbin
I had to watch my own back while I was out mashin'
Closed caption for the hearing impaired
Have you ever seen your closest homey laid out buried and dead?
I shed a tear even though I'm not supposed to cry
I can't lie I ain't ready to die, I ain't ready"
149,Ya Money Or Ya Life,1997,The Untouchable (1997),,Scarface,"One up for the hustlers and two times for the mathematics
Long as I can grind I'm scratching
Stacking cause moneys got a funny way of finding
Your ass this coming out your account when you start the climbing
And blindly got you on a major chase for paper
And now you got your eyes on my vault tryin' to take my paper
The vapors will leave niggas wit dreams to face Satan
I'm pacin' with infa-red beams just waiting
Hatin' and I don't cause the conversation
He spoke wit his killer but now he's got to face him
Racin cause off in these streets you ain't promised tomorrow
So if you bring pain I bring sorrow
I warn you ain't never been down to die slowly
Surely I got niggas down to die for me
You owe me and I want it all and that's that
Bitch you got to pay wit your life not scratch
Don't want no money
I want your life
Don't want no money
I want your life
We straight niggas roll subtractors gettin' down ain't no factor
We just like boys in the hood wit no actors
Jack you got niggas dow to come find you
And heat your ass up and leave your yesterdays behind you
Remind you a niggas definition means killa
If he out of paper he gots to go bring the skrilla
Stretch you ain't never seen drama like I can bring it
I'll wet you and leave you face down for no reason
I seen it- ain't many ways that you can change it
I'm dangerous society got me stamped so I'm gon' blame it
Aiming and if you cal canning at the planet
Stampin' any muther fucker left standin is stranded
And I want it all and that's that
Bitch you got to play wit your life not scratch"
150,You,2015,Deeply Rooted (2015),,Scarface,"(Scarface)
I been there, done that, grew from my fuck ups
A hard head make a nigga soft ass tougher
My momma used to say that one day I'd suffer
If I ain't tighten up and get my shit right, trust her
I'm seventeen out here living the life
And I ain't never coming back home, you giving advice
To a nigga don't need it, I want my freedom
To hang on the corners running from the policemen
If I knew then what I know right now, I would have sat my stupid ass back down
I wouldn't listen
'Cause what she told me in the end came true
What you do to me your kids goin' do, times two
Forgive me momma I ain't mean no harm
But let her tell it, I ain't seen no storm. It's just beginning
But in a minute I'll be waving the flag 'cause I don't think that I can take all that

clap your hands"

Call me psychotive but I'm bad, nigga yo!
And I'ma do ya bad, black
And when I come, I'm bustin' up niggas to hear me, black
Ya should have never let a nigga see
If there was niggas and bitches and bitches and niggas that hated me
Huh, I waited for my date to come-of-age
And now I'm of-age I can't escape the fuckin' front page
So I guess that nigga D is up to hit again
I kicks the funky shit and coke, and stupid like I'm Gilligan
I'm P, supposed to hit a lick for a jack
The only thing I gained is the pain of niggas comin' back
Nigga lookin' for they shit, aggravated and pissed
Niggas they can't fuck with my clique
I'm here to break 'em off for chunk
A D-E-A-T-H-L-Y, a motherfuckin punk
And I be rollin' with the brass
Don't answer with the ziggers in your hood, he break your neck to roll a
Pass, nigga
Don't even stop to say 'Whattup?' 'cause I bust for the fuck
And pay some quick to light a motherfucker up
Next time you stop me on your block, I hope you leave the place
Or be the next to meet the Lord face-to-face
Nigga, I ain't the one to take no bullshit
'Cause see a nigga like the D is game to empty out the full clip
So when I come for ya, act like ya know
Sittin' motherfuckin smooth to the curb but you don't hear do'

It's time to fuck 'em up, here it comes, BLAST, nigga!
Thump to your chest and they comin' out your ass, nigga

Niggas G to kill but still I see that you don't hear me do'
So I'ma serve it to ya fat, hit the deck, mate
Hit the deck mate, call me Flipper when I checkmate
D-um divertin nine, Tre-9, full Glock, Glock
My Glock makin' sounds and it don't stop
So nigga pass the swisha quick
And I'ma blaze till the motherfucker burn me off my fingertips
'Cause, see a nigga gotta saty high
I try to smoke till I can't smoke and then I won't smoke
But still I got my fingers on my shit
And click, click, click, ya die, die, die, ya dead, bitch!
You tried to test the wrong nigga, be a tested
Straight from St.Paul but clockin G's down in Texas
Some think I'm talk 'cause I play it cool
But I ain't the average motherfucker, I do the shit that niggas won't do
Huh, like pistol whip a woodie for his bank
Then after that I gate and grab his bitch and do the same thang
And I will pain up the asshole
Collectin grips on my drips as I stroll but you don't hear me do'
(DMG)
Ain't no mistakin what I'm bringin', you motherfuckers still ain't had
Enough
So I'ma continue to break you off for proper ass chunk
May it be 9, may it be a gauge, may it be a shank
Any way you come I'm in your motherfuckin shit, mate!
Huh, a nigga bustin' caps, smokin' fires
Quick to bring it to your ass and keep on goin' till your ass die
And it ain't no runnin' down dem backstreets
'Cause I got slugs to catch 'em with Carl Lewis on the track meet
Huh, and still you wanna test a nigga so
Audi 5, nigga, hate to see ya go but you don't hear me do'
Yeah, check it!"
152,Your Ass Got Took,1991,Mr. Scarface Is Back (1991),,Scarface,"Get 'em up motherfucker this is it
Hold them up where I can see 'em I take a small bit
'Cause if you make a false move it'll cost ya
No need to cry for help, the world just lost ya
Hell I don't give a fuck about not witnesses
Witness this
Make it so you can't be figured out
If you gotta kill a bitch, let her brain out
Have no mercy when you jack
Just the whole motherfuckin family in the black
Fuck a five-oh, you gotta bail out
Or your black ass is headed for the jail house
People all the judges wanna bust you
The D.A. does the hey and he agrees the court fuckin' up
Hey, the redneck judge caught a boot
A nigga like the Brad 'cause a nigga like the brad shoots
Don't be afraid my brother,
Put your finger on the trigger, close your eyes and squeeze the motherfucker
Fuck the press, you gotta pump your chest
If they don't cooperate, grab some hostages
Kick an old bitch in her pouch
Skull an old nigga, knock his motherfuckin dentures out
Push an old man out his wheelchair
He's still, his quill there, he gets killed there
If it's left up to me I'll bury em
They got a nigga livin' in a sanitarium
A real thief goes by the book
And that's the first example of your ass gettin' took
I'm pullin them motherfuckin boot falls
A nigga's dark as shit got me reachin' for the firearm
But I ain't goin' out like a sucker
I open up and fall down on the fucker
If you're caught in the crossfire
It musta been time for your ass to expire
'Cause I don't shed tears on a victim
Fuck with me, I gotta get him
That's how it is in the motherfuckin streets
Motherfuckin check your nuts and try to play a nigga weak
But I got a little news for your ass
Here's a little blast from the brad
Now put that in your pipe and smoke it
Put your hands around your dick and doke it
You gotta keep your nuts out your stomach fella
'Cause I'ma put a twelve gauge on your ass, nigga
And never take a second look
Your ass got took
Here's some game for you dick-suckin bitches
You're hoes who's givin' up the pussy for the riches
But a nigga like me don't pay shit
To put it blunt to you, homey don't play bitch
So open up and let me get it
Be payin' for the pussy, bitch with it
Ain't no pussy in the world worth cash flow
Put bank in your ass, oh no
It ain't no way, motherfucker
You can be the world's best dick sucker
But you still don't fit on the payroll
I run game on a bitch and lay low
And then I roll with someone else
And let the other motherfucker play himself
Let her get his cash flow
But I'm still gettin' that ass broke
Let the other nigga keep her
But every time you fuck her ain't that pussy gettin' deeper?
I bet it kinda makes you wonder
When you're home all alone, ""Yo, action place is farther""
Ha ha ha, I thought you had her
But when you fall asleep, yo, she's rollin' with the Bradster
I peep out game and just chill
You gave her money for rent, but honey paid my light bills
It ain't like a nigga ain't rich
But a bitch has gotta pay for this dick
Reverse the game, get her hooked
Yo, her ass got took"
