1,2 Bitches,2000,You Nasty (2000),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Pimp niggas don't pay a dime,
I'm fuckin' 2 bitches at the same time
Then I hit the studio and I write a rhyme,
I Call it ""Tramp Hoes Ain't Hard to Find""
I took 2 bitches to a hotel
I told 'em both ""you know I won't tell""
Bitch, curiosity killed the cat
You gotta lick the clit while I hit it from the back
Don't be stingy girl, lick my balls too
You was talkin' big shit when I called you
You said you never fucked another girl before
And you wanted me to help you so
Bitch, I took you down to the strip club
I told you ""look around, who you wanna fuck?""
You picked thick chocolate, big booty, big tits
I told her she could have you, and this dick
She got so excited she got off work early
Jumped in the back and started lickin' on my girlie
I couldn't get home fast enough
Now its time to fuck
When we got to my room she started actin' nervous
Sat down and said ""lets order room service""
I said ""bitch, what are ya smokin'?
A big fat dick comin' from East Oakland""
I stuck it in her mouth she started moanin
I said ""hang up, get off my telephone, bitch""
I put the game down immediately
I'm a vet from the town started freakin them freaks
And once they started, they couldn't stop
I fuck 'em for awhile then I kick back and watch
Two bitches at the same time
And neither one of these hoes is mine
I don't give a fuck I'm a player
I been doin' this for years, I got bitches everywhere
You think I'm payin' hoes? You got the game distorted
You a trick, mad cause you can't afford it
Them bitches kissed 20 minutes straight non-stop
Strip girl on the bottom, lil momma on top
It was beautiful, you know what happened next
Spent 20 more minutes lickin' each others breasts
Two titty suckin hoes, navels and toes
Bitch rolled her on her stomach, licked her asshole
I was smokin' on a fat one, layin in the cut
After seein this shit, I ain't wanna fuck
I wanna see how long they can keep goin'
I don't know, I fell asleep on 'em
When I woke up I was gettin' my dick sucked
These hoes horny as fuck, they can't get enough
I was fuckin' them sluts till the sun came up
Nut in both their mouths, you ever done that stuff?
Dog baby, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
You better handcuff your ho or I'll be fuckin' your freak, nigga
Sing it, pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fuckin' 2 bitches at the same time,
Fuckin' 2 bitches at the same time
Let 'em know pimp niggas don't pay a dime, bitch
Hit the studio and write a rhyme
These tramps ain't hard to find nigga
Bitch
2 Bitches
2 of em"

If you got that paper we can roll
No time for hataz, gotta go
(Too $hort)
I flew to L.A. just last week
Jumped in the limo, checked in the suite
Made a few calls, it's time to go
Bust a few rhymes at the studio
You know I don't do it for the love of it
I love it but I do it for the love I get
Big checks, you think the sex is next
When I left the studio
I had to go do a show for the ten with the triple zeros
That's why I never flipped with kilos
Flew up to the bay, then back to Georgia
Had to catch a flight to Tallahassee, Florida
I did a show at the Kapa luau
Short dog what'cha about to do now?
I'm getting money, caught a flight to New York
Just another day in the life of Too $hort

A hundred thousand dollars might get you a hook
>From this nigga right here, I know you know
And you gotta pay extra for the video
So cut the check for the right amount
If not, you can wire it to my account

5,Ain't No Bitches,1999,Can't Stay Away (1999),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy ""All I got is top notch""
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop
I'm the super player, I got women everwhere
I know you love a square, I don't care
I still get it, anytime I want to
Call her at the house, I think she said ""come through""
I'm coming, every time I see her
That's what I'm doing, I can't believe ya
When ya tell me, she's all yours
'Cause when I have her on the floor, down on all fours
She said its mine, and that's for sure
If you come around when I'm near, you gotta go
Cause you don't nothing bout this ballers work
When we was players coming up we knocked all the girls
And now I just go out and take my pick
If you gotta enough game you can take my bitch
I won't hate you, try to clown, I'll put you down
'Cause I got women all over this town
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy ""All I got is top notch""
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop
You couldn't be a betta player then me, you ain't got enough game
You couldn't take her from me, you ain't even have a chance
Not with me in the picture
You even got the last dance to see what it could gets you
Nothing, broken hearted and lonely
'Cause when it's over, she's going home with me
Five foot nine short hair big booty
Looking like the leading lady starring in a movie
Fly crib, mercedes benz
She loves niggas like me and my shady friends
And when we hang out, don't count the champagne bottles
Thinking I'm drunk, I don't play game lotto
I put the game down from the start
And you ain't nothing but a dumb ass mark
She started teasing when she saw the red carpet
What did you say nigga ""Get ya ass in the car bitch""
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy ""All I got is top notch""
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop
Hoochies, cheerleaders, groupies, beer drinkers
High class stuck up hoes, that getting real freaky
Laywers, nurses, police women, teachers
If she's a top notch, I keep her
Tall ass models, skinny and shit, big tities, short and thick
All complexions, different nationalities
Pimp game from from east oakland, out to cali
Keep 'em teenage to middle age, is she paid
'Cause if she ain't, what can she make
If I see a bad bitch I ain't fin away,
I'm gonna holla at her, I can't discriminate
It's not about the sex, not all the time,
'Cause I'm trying to get in her mind
Like when ya stand and just stare at the ocean
I help ya manage your emotions, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot
Like I said homeboy ""All I got is top notch""
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop"
6,Ain't Nothin' But a Word to Me,1990,Short Dog's in the House (1990),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Now take my bitch, she won't complain about shit
Because she's my hoe, she don't belong to a trick
So when you fuck her and give her all your cash
I get paid or put my foot in her ass
I won't marry the bitch, and give her half
I get more head and then I laugh at the one bitch shit
I got a gang of hoes
I get, freak, ass, lick, these balls and toes
Now stupid little bitches get tossed
If they don't realize I'm the motherfucking boss
Come on down and get your ass pinched
And if you talk shit, get your ass lynched
'Cause I'm the B, the I, the T, the C, the H
The K, the I, the L, the L, the A
Ice Cube, a nigga that's bigga than a nut
'Cause a bitch is a bitch is a hoe is a slut
You say how can I call a women a bitch?
It ain't nothing but a word like shit
Ain't no slippin' in my motherfucking pimping
And all bitches ain't women
You come home and get smooth cussed out
You gotta a bitch with a foul ass mouth
Scared to tripp her with a left hook
You'z a bitch in my book, bitch
My nigga Jinx made the mix
So punk ass motherfucking bitches get the 86
I keep hoes on five
(Yeah bitch)
'Cause I'm fucking more pussy than the law allow
With my boy Too $hort
See, he quick to grab a bitch by the throat
And slam her ass, cram her ass, with a fat dick
'Cause she's a trick bitch
I like fat bitches and I like 'em slim
I'll take a fat bitch and stick my dick right in, her big fat ass
She'll make me cum again
I'm mack daddy bitch, fuck her friend
I saw your homegirl, she said what's up with us
I said nothing, fucked her on a tour bus
She got it good too, dicked down on the floor
The bitch was fine, but the pussy ain't good as yours
She a straggler, struggler, straight salome smuggler
Everytime I see the bitch, she's looking uglier
And if you got a trick ass on your left
Sitting there with dick on her breath
Last night she sucked my dick, now she's kissing little man
Won't even suck my dick, unless cut out the middle man
And if you have never heard of me you'z a bitch
It ain't but a word to me
I'll stop calling ya, beyotch
Man, fuck these hoes man, ya know
Nappy ass bitch ass tramp ass sluty ass hoe
I'll stop calling ya, beyotch
I go hard on a bitch, fuck respect for ya men
I get my way with a bitch, when I act like a pimp
Always carrying bank, but I fooled the bitch
'Cause all she ever got was to druel on my dick
Ice Cube will slap a hoe for the fuck of it
Just like me and that's some real shit
Bitch got bold with her loud ass mouth
Tough ass bitch got knocked out
You know a bitch ain't nothin' but a word to me
Some of you punks are just scared to see
If you could call that bitch a bitch you would
And if you can't, you probably should
I'm spitting game to you mark ass lames
On how how to get a bitch and treat the bitch like shit
You can't buy love, all pimps know that
It's all about the way old Short Dogg macks
Don't hold the bitch hand or walk side by side
Go first class every time you fly
She'll go Greyhound and just meet you there
I'm just an ice cold hard ass Oakland player
You want to tongue kiss bitch, it figures
I introduce you to my homeboy Richard
Also known by his nickname Dick
Now let's tongue kiss bitch
I like big butts so let it be known to the public
I bust a rap or two and the bitches love it
I'm only out for one thing so hate me
I ain't the one so don't try to fade me
I don't wear too much gold because it's tacky
I bust a Raider hat T-Shirt and Khakis
See a lot of hoes in freaky clothes everyday
So I talk to 'em in any ol can I way
See a bitch need a nigga to coach 'em
So I grab my dick and smoothly approach 'em
I say hi and I'm really kind of pitched
If they ignore me then I say, ""Yo freak bitch""
Give up the number hardly, we'll have a slumber party
You see I'll fuck you to death and then I'll dump the body
'Cause I'm a nigga that's bigga than crew or a gang
And when it comes to bitches I'm out for only one thang
Yo bitch ain't nothing but a word to me, $hort"
7,Ain't Nothing Like Pimpin',1995,Cocktails (1995),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Ain't nothin' like pimpin' just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Ain't nothin' like pimpin' just don't quit
Mother fuck you damn shithead bitch
My diamonds and the Lex say it's time to flow
Wonder how I got rich, they say I rhyme too slow, so
I'm from the ""O"" I for what I know
And like I told your ass before you can fuck my hoe
I ride nothin' but vogues, ain't hittin' no switches
Top down in my Caddy just me and my bitches
With a Ziplock bag full of green weed
I roll it all up 'cause I'm a fiend in need
Of some dank smoke all up in my chest
Dangerous Crew got the bomb, we don't smoke that stress
'Cause we getting funky on album 9
I smoked a few joints bitch now I'm fine
Studio's in a cloud
Smelling kind of loud
Nothin' like pimpin'
Nigger fuck Bill Clinton
Make me the mother fucking president
I'll make the White House a hoe house and all the pimps, To just
Set up shops like they do in Vegas
Legalize pimpin' for all the playas
Puttin' fine ass bitches in the streets and the hood
Every year a nigger trade for a new Fleetwood
You know I'm rollin', I can't be faking
I come through and all your hoes I'm taking
You know I'm rolling, don't do no simpin'
I'm an Oaktown player ain't nothin' like pimpin'
Ain't nothin' like the pimp game you should know
Never love a bitch or a hoe
You fell in love with her though trying to get in them pants
And the next thing ya know your baby momma's a tramp
Don't get mad now nigger want to shove the bitch
'Cause a year ago, you know, you loved the bitch
Now your stomach's upset and your feelings are hurt
She gotcha looking like an old banana peel in the dirt
Bitch, slipped up and hit your ass for a lick
Talking that mother fucking baby shit
You'z a punk ass nigger can't you see
Thatz the difference between niggers like you and me
I got bitches, on my mind
It's been like that for a real long time
I know the way them hoes take your cash
They let you fuck and make you pay up fast
Trick nigger, why you wanna be like that
Let them try for lent bitches take your fat ass stack
Couldn't tell them hoes nothin' but the punk in you
'Cause they already know what they want from you
Big bank, Ben Franklin, do the bitch just fine
She'll be taking all of yours and can't fuck with mine
I'm the M to the A to the C and K
All you player hating niggas shouldn't be that way

Mother fuck you damn shit head bitch
Lights, camera, action, cut
Hollywood look out the bitch is coming up
She took acting classes 'bout to be on her way
On a Greyhound bus from home to L.A.
She said it wouldn't take long to make it to the top
A few auditions land a job
I was down in L.A., hit the club for a drink
I'm a player ass nigger tell me what do ya think
I walked up to the bitch in my clean ass suit
And I told her, I've been watching you
I peeped you out from the bar
You must be a model or a movie star
She said ""No, but that's my dream.
To see my face on the movie screen""
I tell ya nothing but game came out my mouth
She was talking 'bout agents, I was turning her out
I said ""Listen real close to what I'm saying.
All you need is me; you don't need no agent""
I'm a pimp ass nigger and the game don't stop
""All you gotta do is fuck a few big shots,
'Cause if you can't do that, they're going to hold ya back""
She was sucking up the game, down to do all that
She said ""Short baby, I ain't no simp""
But the nigger in the suit ain't nothin' but a pimp
And all them white guys you had sex with
They weren't big shots, they were nothing but tricks
She came to me and said it just won't last
I looked, and I laughed, and I kicked her ass
'Cause all she wanted was the fame
But you can't get shit when you don't have game
Guerrilla pimpin' just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Guerrilla pimps just don't quit

I used to have alot of bitches
Straight down for me
Doin' anything I said, even hoe on the street
But I'm a dog & I dog my broads
Gorilla pimpin' drivin' 4 door cars
Ain't got no kids but them bitches love daddy
They had to share me or them bitches couldn't have me
'Cause I'm a mack with a capital M
Call me $hort dog baby, put the P in the pimp
I keep my foot in your ass and wouldn't give a fuck
Get out her pocket, bitch you gettin' beat up
You see me hangin' with them niggas like jock
And every single 5 mile, bitches gettin' popped
Well now I got a rep and they say I'm wrong
I beat my broad ass and she moved back home
Came in one night, I was buzzin'
Bitch tried to front me for fuckin' her cousin
She started yellin' man, the bitch got raw
I took one step back and went straight to her jaw
I gives a fuck that the bitch left
'Cause all she ever got was some good dick
And it really ain't shit to find another bitch
'Cause I'm a cool muthafucker & I'm hella rich
Yeah, ant banks in the house and you know he knows
Grab the mic nigga, fuck these hoes
Ant banks:
Yeah, I'm thinkin' back 'fore a nigga just came up
Playin' games with the bitches
Thought a nigga might change but
I was tight thinkin' everything's all right
Doin' the same shit to a different bitch every night
Just dickin' 'em down like a gigolo
So you gotta peep game from a nigga though
I'm too young to get sprung so don't trip, tell'em
""Ain't no love, bitch.""
So let's speak about a freak named Connie
Fucked the bitch tough, backstage at the omni
I can't forget constance, the bitch is so dumb
Quick to lick my nuts, suck my dick and just hum
And these are just some hoes
That a nigga like tossed up, kinda crossed up
Turned out and lost but I ain't trippin'
They all got tramped
Used and abused till they all just vamped
And left a nigga stuck with no kind of get back
Now I even get shook by the hoodrats
'Cause they know what the fuck they gon' get
Took for they cash & a mouth full of dick, huh
And I hate I gotta be that way
Goin' vicious on these bitches
Just made'em all leave today
But I know it won't last long
They sayin' fuck ant banks
Now All My Bitches Is Gone.
Too $hort:
All My Bitches Are Gone, them bitches bounced
I had a gang of'em, now they can't be found
They ain't fuckin' with $hort dog
'Cause I'm from oakland
You fuck with us bitch, somethin' gettin' broken
Your leg, arm, jaw, nose, pick a part
Oakland muthafuckers'll break your heart
Until you recognize game in your face
You's a punk ass bitch, ain't never been no place
I can't hold back, now's the time
To leave your stank fake broke ass bitches behind
And move on like a player
I'm knockin' ghetto hoes and even squares
Secretaries, nurses and police women
I'm flyin' first class, nigga, fuckin' flight attendants
$Hort dog ain't nothin' but a dog, bitch
""Ain't nothin' new nigga, come again""
All My Bitches Are Gone, them bitches cut
But I really don't give a fuck
I always knew I didn't need that hoe
I got the game from the muthafuckin' E S O
And you can tell when I hit the place
All them star struck bitches jump in my face
And get shot to the curb like I'm the mob
Unless they givin' niggas Blowjob's.
Ant banks:
Yeah and when a bitch wanna flirt
I put in work, treat'em all like dirt
And watch them get they feelin's hurt
'Cause I'm a mack, hoe, listen to this rap, hoe
And you will know not to fuck around
You'll get slapped, hoe
For tryin' to fuck-up the Ant Banks program
Steady saltin' with your sanky ass toe jams
Your mad 'cause I wouldn't spend no time
I'm with the homies, makin' cash
Pullin' bitches and writin' rhymes
I'm just doin' what I got to do
I'm not fuckin' with you
Because your funky ass cock is through
So now I gotta get some new hoes
Some old school bitches
That's still ridin' trues and vogues
I want a freak with the gangsta look
That Ant Banks can hook
And the bitch better know how to cook
'Cause I'm a nigga that'll eat some shit up
Macaroni, steak, collard greens, or whatever the fuck
Yeah $hort, you know how we do'em
Treat bitches like red lights and run right through'em
I got my mack on strong and my dick on long
So fuck it, all my bitches can stay gone.
Too $hort:
Mine too.
Ant Banks:
You know what I'm sayin'?
Too $hort:
Yeah, bitch.
Ant Banks:
$Hort dog in the muthafuckin' house.
Too $hort:
Nah nigga, you in this muthafucker.
Ant Banks:
Bringin' this shit for 9-tre & 9-4.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Get In Where You Fit In, hoes.
Too $hort:
Before you need a check up from the neck up.
Ant Banks:
Peace out
Fuck these bitches, man
Fuck these bitches, $hort,
Let's get out of here, man."

I give a little, I take a little
(Too $hort)
I can't be sober, 'cause I smoke weed a lot
Tried to be faithful, but I like to cheat a lot
You couldn't even trust me, 'cause I used to lie sometimes
I'll say I love you, but not until I get mines
I tried to have one girl but I flirt too much
I know exactly what to do to get her to fuck
Baby I promise, you're the only one for me
You know you want this, you always have fun with me
But not tomorrow, 'cause I got another date
If all the little girls, would just do what their mothers say
I wouldn't be a player, and shoot 'em with the facial cream
I used to manage my love like a baseball team
I had to have a good line-up
Put 'em in rotation when they sign up, a whole lot of vagina
I even had a farm camp, where they'd get upgraded later
Can you hang with the players if you make it to the majors?
I give a little... I take a little
I give a little... we do it all for looooooove
I do it all for looooove
(Too $hort)
Can I change? Or will I stay the same?
Will I be serious or keep playin' games?
Tonight, I'm tryin' to see the light
Is there a woman in here that wants to be my wife?
I want a family, I got a lot to give
I want children, but I ain't got no kids
I wanna love you, but did I wait too long
It took smiles and tears to make this song
(Silk E)
Here's why we don't hear shit while y'all pleadin your case
Your fingers crossed behind your back and a smirk's on your face
With million dollar dreams fallin' in and out of your neck
What'chu want us to do, we girls, we ain't playin' with a full deck
We expect some of the bullshit, so we play along
It's wrong, the game of cat and mouse, you hit and you gone
Now we 'sposed to feel sorry for the big bad wolf
Find him fuck him with no condoms - the game come from the crooks
How would it look? A queen gettin' played by a rook'
Be your baby momma by evenin, can't have that on the books
Dickmatized, with sex faces in the d-boy stance
Effervescently sellin me dreams of circumstance
How I need to be a team player - I'd rather be the owner
Why get with bein a boss to be some work on the corner?
You're huntin for the next hot ass before the club close
How you lookin' for love if all you run with is hoes?
Enjoy the ride baby
We smokin' good, we ridin' clean
And you in the mix wit'cha O.G. potnah Too $hort

All the time, gettin' mine, that's why I'm pimpin'
That's why I'm pimpin', all the time
Gettin' mine...
That's how we do it, straight pimpin'
All the time, all the time
It's the original, D-O-G, Short Dawg
They said don't do it, but I gotta go off
You talked a lot of shit and can't back it up
Say you make a lot of money and can't stack enough
Spend it on the strippers and the prostitutes
Do what you gotta do
No SoundScans got your record label hot at you
They droppin' you, two years ago we was poppin' you
You was talkin' shit about nobody stoppin' you
I told the lil' homey a long time ago
If you put your mind to it, you can find some dough
It don't matter, even if yo' pockets kinda low
All you gotta do is knock a fine ass hoe
Fuck that bitch like a porno star
Walk her to the corner I bet she won't go far
I knew the day would come when you would notice it
Get wise and realize bein broke ain't shit
Chorus: Too $hort
That's why I'm pimpin', all the time
Gettin' hoes to give me money, I'm gettin' mine
You know I ain't lyin'
'Cause what I spend and what I'm ridin' is the shit
That's why I do this; straight pimpin', all the time
If you see my bitch hoein, I'm gettin' mine
You know I ain't lyin', tricks love what I'm supplyin
It's the shit, that's why I do this
(Too $hort)
It's been around a long time
Pimpin', manipulatin minds, prostitutin women
Pussy - is worth a lot of money
She says that everyday you gotta pay me when you want me
Tricks like to fuck and do that freaky shit
You know I kick my hoe ass, she don't bring me gifts
I'm talkin' cold cash money, nothin' else'll do
Get my money bitch you better fuck until he's through
Make that trick come quick, and don't stop him
And if he's slippin, you better rob him
Go out and turn another date, don't hesitate
You know daddy loves you when you keep my money straight
You ride the best cars, eat good, and drink fat
You can't do this shit without me don't you ever think that
Recognize my bald head and my gangsta limp
Damn it feels good to be a pimp
(Too $hort)
I hear you squares, you try to criticize us players
But when the pussy's on sale I see you always there
A good customer, you know yo' game ain't tough
And even though we came up doin' all the same stuff
I'm a pimp, I turn a bitch out quick
Have her standin on the corner tryin' to get some dick
Lay on yo' back bitch, and get my cash
'Cause if you don't, I gotta kick yo' ass
Fuck all that drama
This ain't HBO I whup you like yo' momma
If you don't pay me hoe, I do this everyday
I check bitches and get paid
I want the money I ain't tryin' to get laid
Ain't nuttin new about this shit, it's the oldest profession
Sellin pussy while it's snowin at the coldest intersection
I know how you feel about me, you love me
Turnin' tricks thinkin' of me

She ain't really happy 'less she lickin' a dick
With a sucker-ass nigga that be trickin an' shit
You can't train the pussy, by lockin it up
Raw dickin the pussy, and knockin' it up (nope)

Can't love the bitch, turned around to pimp her
Make your wife your ho, and your ho your wife
You can't do this dumb shit your whole life
That ain't pimpin' - you need to let that go
Run home to your wife and forget that ho

Runnin' through the streets of the O is to blame mayne
You always frontin - whassup wit you?
You either do what you told or tell people what to do
Are you a boss or a worker - you big pimpin'
All by yourself and ain't got no women

Album number 12
Short Dogg still in the house
I ain't going back into retirement
Life is...
Anything is possible try hard
It ain't logical fuck an obstical bitch
How can I make twelve albums
All them gold and platinums
And I am still clowin
It ain't hard
I used to be a broke nigga
Dreamin' about brodes and smoking bigger
Dedicated to the rap game
Too $hort I know you know that name
2000 makes me a 20 year veterian
Still making money and I don't stop rapping
That's my motto even if you niggas hit the lotto
You never could win not until I go
I know you squares can't hang with me
What you talking about you can't spit this game like me
Some of y'all suckers need to fall in love
And stay there and quit trying to be a player
Fuck around and fuck your life up
Or a tramp ass bitch with a nice butt
You should of went to collage
Got your degree and a job stop trying to be like me
It's too hard cause you don't even know this streets
And me I mack this hoes with need
See and you all you do is smoke that weed
She broke your heart and got you on your knees
But me I know how to treat a bitch
Fuck all that nice ass sweethard shit
Suck my dick now that's foreplay
Now I am about to fuck you on the floor in the doorway
Treat you like a hoe okay? you like that
Leave when I am finished and say I'll be right back
Bitch! you already knew what it was
What's a dogg like me going to do with your love
I drive it down the street tied to my bumper
I don't care how find she is
I am trying to dump her
I already fucked her
You need to get on bitch and find you a sucker
Get married divorced and get half
Maybe you should reason with her before she gets mad
Or maybe my nigga you should slap that bitch
If not then you need to snatch that bitch
By the throught and let her know this is how it goes
Say what's on your mind, now she knows
Some of y'all ladies need to check your man
For acting like a bitch every time he gets a chance
Backslap him tell him shut up and stop crying
And stop all that wineing
Bitch ass nigga you need to buy yourself some business
And quit askin all them motherfucking questions
Ain't no slaves around here
Ain't nobody gettin' paid around here
It's all true about this hoes and me
You ain't got no game you don't know what she needs
Lame than a motherfucker about this mack shit
Still letting bitchs monipulate your actions
When you going learn how to wear the pants
Try and give this real player rhythm a chance
It's all about the money and feeding your family
If I am macking hoes and you can't stand me
Keep my name out your ????? mouth
You hate a player and I find out
I might fuck your bitch little sister or your momma
More than one time just to add to the drama
Give you something to talk about
Life long trick learn your mouth
'Cause I don't stop macking and I am always rapping
I fucked your little sister but I was just praticing
Short little bitch I picked her up
Diggin this big ass dick in her gut
I let her walk the funny
What's wrong $hort Dogg last night got his fuck on
And you was trying to hate me I got cha
I fucked your little sister nigga anything is possible

(Too $hort)
We got a new dance (ay let's see it)
It's called the Back Back (let's see it)
Let's do it baby
Back Back (back back) Back Back (back back)
Back Back (back back) Back Back (back back)
When I walked in the door first thing I saw
Was you drinkin' at the bar, doin' it all
Dancin like I never seen it done before
You don't need a dance partner on the floor
You just bounce that ass like it's goin' out of style
Love the way the music sound, goin' hella wild
Another time, another zone
It's like yo' ass got a mind of it's own
It keeps sayin' I don't wanna be alone
We need to swap numbers, I'll call you later on
And since I made your favorite song
It's all right tonight, don't do a player wrong
Your booty goes on and on
You could stand still and it won't be long
Before it moves, I love the way your panties shake
I heard your booty got banned in twenty states
[Chorus: Bishop of Crunk] + (Too $hort)
BACK BACK! (Girl you 'bout to hurt somebody)
BACK BACK! (On the dance floor workin the party)
(That Lil' Jon beat got her freakin again)
(That's how her momma used to dance on that Seagram's gin)
BACK BACK! (That booty cain't stop)
BACK BACK! (Can you make it drop?)
(They been shakin like that since the 80's)
(Man they ain't never gon' stop, are you crazy?)
(Too $hort)
Even when you sit in a chair, you still keep bouncin'
Put it right here and I will be pouncin
Watch how I slide on up
I might need a saddle, to ride that butt
Girl you think it's wide enough?
Can I plug it in the wall, and light it up?
Does it come with an instruction manual?
Can I twist yo' knobs while I touch yo' handles?
Can I see you do it booty butt-naked?
Back Back, girl you too wild you gon' break it
Damn! I thought it was mine
But my dick belongs to you since you started to grind
I see why they call it a crime
A woman like you is hard to find
The way you twerk that junky, make it funky
Cain't take this from me girl shake that monkey!
[Chorus] w/ minor variations
(Too $hort)
Damn baby, how you move like that?
Is it the music or the way that I do my rap?
I wanna sick my dog, on yo' cat
'Cause I love the way you do the Back Back
Just bounce that ass till you cain't no mo'
Till your cheeks start to sag and you can't go low
When your arthritis kicks in at 44
Keep shakin that ass like a hoe
20 years from now she'll still get down
And booty shakin music'll still be around
It's a family tradition, cain't let it die
You saw that ass shake, that's how he met his wife
I'm up all night, me and my whole crew
Don't hate 'cause it's late when I roll through
In the middle of the night, tryin' to get in your mind
I'ma wiggle in tight and I'ma hit from behind
So Back Back! - Whoa, did you see that mayne?
Girl stop playin' don't change a thang
Watchin you dance I almost came
The way you shakin that ass is insane
I, cain't believe my eyes
I can see from the rear what's between your thighs
Took two steps back and realized
Yo' ass is a real prize
(Bishop of Crunk)
Back Back!
Let me slap that ass, let me slap that ass
Back Back! {?} yo' ass
Shorty move that shit, ass hit like this
Ass so quick make that booty wanna split"

A bad man, survival is whatever you can
You think you know it, flossin but I know you's a bitch,

Of hurtin' ass shit that I faced the last time
My last dime, goes on food I'm in the mood for a stick-up,
To pick up lil' somethin' on a get up
You hit up, blessed by the way I protest,
Your world, gettin' it all of my chest
Yes the struggle grab me, hatin' better have me,
Drama from my Momma, disowned by my Daddy
What should I do, tuck my head and throw them rolos,
If anybody know about the trouble I bet Joe knows
And raw livin' it remind me,
Of the shit that I wanna put behind me
I'm stayin high for days 'cause what I'm doin' it pays,

You was hugged up with her when I met her,
She gave me that look like please make it better
I told her with my eyes, meet me over there,
Instantly, she was the victim of a player
I be spittin' this game like Iceberg Slim,
What about your man, she said ""Fuck him""
Let's roll, so we jumped in the Benz,
Left you at the bar, talkin' to your friends

16,Baller,2006,Blow The Whistle (2006),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"I ain't gotta say much, $hort
So you wanna be a baller?
David Banner, Big Face
You wanna get paid?
You gotta keep tryin', just don't give up
Can't get on your feet 'cause you just won't get up
You dream about havin' nice things but you don't have a plan
How you gon' get it, from your Uncle Sam?
Your welfare check can't buy a house and a Benz
What'chu wanna be, a mouse or a man?
You need a hustle, somethin' that'll make some cash
Don't step on the gas, you're goin' way too fast
In your new sports car, you're dreamin' again
Snap out of it, I know you're fiendin' to win
You need to start from the beginnin', get a paper and pen
What'chu like to do, what's your favorite thing?
There's gotta be somethin' you can do wit'cha life
Sell things that a whole bunch of people will buy
Make a lot of profits, make bank deposits
Wanna live like this, here's a shoe, how's it fit?
How you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame
Now how you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle?
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame
Wanna play with they life but won't play with they kids
They'll ball for these *** but won't invest ***
Go to church and pray to blue eyes, church is for them pew thighs
Supersized by fries, I pimp a lot of ***
But I'd rather save yo' lives
I'm from a place where they hung black folks
Where a bird can be whipped from some raw endo
Now you broke 'cause you smoke and you don't got a job
Man, get up off yo' a*** and do just like Todd
Sell yo' *** up out the trunk
Stop hatin' other ***, you can get what you want
You can get what you need without makin' others bleed
I'm the master of the P U S S E
Oops, I meant Y, others gotta die
Just to help sorry-*** lames get by
Now you'll let a bird die if you saw a bush
But you're *** in the hood, come get douched
How you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame
Now how you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle?
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame
When you finally start makin' some dough
You gotta work a lot harder, way more than befo'
It ain't hard to get in but it's hard to stay
When you start pimpin', it's all night, all day
Non-stop, gettin' it, then you start kickin' it
Out with some ***, later on, you'll be stickin' it
Move forward and continue to do what men do
Gettin' money 'cause it's in you
Or maybe bein' a man ain't in you, you ***
You can sell out your own just so you can get rich
No soul, no vibe but you sportin' a cross
Man, the truth is you're tired and your spirit is lost
I've been baptized in dirt, pull your panties up
Rather shoot ya in your mind instead of blowin' out your liver
David Banner, Mississippi, to the day that I die
You can make it in this world, stand up, *** try
How you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame
Now how you gon' ball if you got no hustle?
How you gon' pimp if you got no game?
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle?
Your life ain't right 'cause you so damn lame"
17,Be My Dirty Love,2000,You Nasty (2000),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Singer croons ""be my... dirty love"" 2X while Short spits)
Ain't nuttin changed... Short Dawg
Sheezee... sheezee
(Singer croons ""be my... (be my) dirty love (dirty love)"" 2X)
Much love y'all
Short Dawg's in this
Verse One: Too $hort
I'm high profile, but you can't see me hoe
Got limosine tint like a real CEO
Hands free, talkin' on the speaker phone
Handlin my business, just tryin' to get my freak on
You know, bitches always beepin me with code 69
I'm real with mine, I make hoes wait in line
Can't fuck 'em all, and don't want to
Cause some of these tramps might front you (watch out)
You waited six months, I fucked her on the first date
And so I smoke the green weed to keep my mind straight
It's Friday, doin' shit my way
Me and yo' bitch, rollin' down the highway (right)
While you shootin that... she gave it up easy
Fore-a-play and all that, wasn't tryin' to tease me
Now you wanna feud, fuck that shit (slut)
Let's fight behind a lady, not that punk ass bitch
(Singer croons ""be my... dirty love"" 2X while Short spits)
Watch em... keep your eyes open
Doesn't make sense
Verse Two: Too $hort
Now here I go, spittin' another verse
Let the pen read my mind cause the shit ain't rehearsed
I'm so curious, about what this fat bitch have
A big bag of weed and a pack of zig-zags (smokin')
So I kicked it with her, with no intentions to fuck
Smoked up her weed and got my dick sucked (yeah right)
I said I got a lot of money but I'm short on cash
Could you give a nigga some so I can get some gas? (stupid shit)
She gave me twenty dollars, I know it's small pimpin'
But it's mandatory, when I deal with all women (all these hoes)
It ain't gon' be no one-sided, I support her shit
Just because she hurt, Too $hort got a grip, beyitch!
I break it down, like the beat
Ride you like a motherfuckin seventy-three
Old school, every time I roll through
All you suckers know who all the bitches go to, Short Dawg
(Singer croons ""be my... dirty love"" 2X while Short spits)
Fuck a bitch... they fuck with you main
Foul mouthed little motherfuckers... ?
Verse Three: Too $hort
It's cause rap music is like sellin dope
Every dollar you invest you get seven mo' (and that's real)
I hope you never ask me, how much it costs
If you can't figure out how the fuck I floss (big ballin)
You better get in where you fit in
Cause a nigga like me ain't kiddin (no jokes)
Here come her boyfriend, with that narrow minded shit
Kissin' on the bitch, she sucked e'rybody dick (slut)
Don't get mad, you knew the bitch had flaws
Ridin' in the Benz (bitch) dick hangin' out my drawers...
... Now why she give me head? (why?)
All she ever wanted was to get in my bed
I ain't gotta be a trick to tramp your hoe (nope)
I spit the game like a pimp while I'm ridin' chrome
I had a dream I was through, can't sell records
Can't catch hoes, bring 'em home and get naked (what?)
It's not the first time, I had this dream
But music is my drug and I'm a dopefiend (straight)
The way I put it down, it don't seem too hard
Scorin points like Kareem-Abdul Jabbar (swish)
And if you tryin' to catch me, you'll find out fast
What you tryin' to do is an impossible task (can't do it)
'Cause what I'm doin' (can't do that) no rapper ever did it
(Can't do that) Eleven albums and I'm still the shit, bitch!
(Singer croons ""be my... dirty love"" 2X while Short spits)
Can't do that... nah nah... ain't gon' happen
Old school Too $hort, that's right I said Too $hort
(Singer croons ""be my... (be my) dirty love (dirty love)"" 2X)
We go way back, youknowhatI'msayin?
Buy you some motherfuckin business
Get up out the madness"
18,Blow Job Betty,1983,"Greatest Hits, Volume 1: The Player Years 1983-1988 (1993)",Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Right about now in the place to be
Too $hort baby
Gettin' real funky with the muthafuckin'
Dangerous Crew, bitch, with that old school.
Too $hort baby, I'm so hard
Pimpin' these hoes on the boulevard
But I'm not here to tell you about me
I got a little story about a nasty freak
She's the kind of girl you think about in bed
Blowjob Betty givin' real good head
Bust a left nut, right nut in her jaw
Sperm on her cheeks is all you saw
She could blow more head than a whale blows water
Blowjob Betty make your dick get harder
She's a one of a kind, a hell of a girl
A trip & a half around the world
Catch her gettin' busy, bitch wouldn't stop
She's the kind of girl that make your toes pop
Every time I used to see her, I would know what's up
Blowjob Betty better blow me up
I remember the day when I first met her
Bitch kinda loose so I knew I'd get her
Walked up to her said
My name is $hort, just what you've been lookin' for
Pimp is my game, I do it the best
Hoe fuck with me, she don't get no rest
Well after that, I G'd the freak
I used to stop by and fuck about twice a week
And from the very first time I went to her house
Walked in the door and stuck my dick in her mouth
$Hort dog'll get bitches anytime I wanna
Got a big dick and lay it right on her tonsils
Only stick it in about half way back
'Cause if I put it all in, it bust straight through her neck
Niggas always sayin' how they fucked that bitch
But I'm the only nigga that the bitch made rich
Like any other tramp she loved to fuck
With any muthafucker got nuts to suck
I spit game to the bitch, just like this.
Why you runnin' round suckin' all that dick for no money?
It didn't take long to stay true to the game
And get my pimpin' on
But every once in a while you get a stupid hoe
Bitch ain't about money and she'll never know how to get it
Blowjob Betty was dumb
A fiend for a fuck & a mouth full of come
She made money for a minute but she loved the sex
So I cut the bitch loose like a old school 'vette.
6 months later, I'm still a pimp, I'm still a player
One night at a club, she was puttin' in work
All you had to do was step up to her
She was in the bathroom sayin' one at a time
Wasn't my bitch but she still was fine
So I went in the back room, seen the bitch
Slapped her on the head, said ""You ready to switch?""
And to the players out there
Instantly, Blowjob Betty started servin' me
'Cause the player I am till the day I'm dead
I was sittin' on the sink gettin' some head
It was all so good and much too true
One young freak & a whole damn crew
But then I shot that fatal nut
Must of knocked that bitch on her ass
She couldn't even breathe, she was holdin' her throat
Me and my homies just hit the door
My homeboy said $hort don't worry
But that next day I read this story
A young girl died just last night
She choked on sperm in her windpipe
It was on her face, her neck and chest
And we're sorry to say there's no suspect
When I saw that my brain clicked
I bust a nut and killed a bitch
It might sound sick, it might be petty
But you never got sucked by Blowjob Betty!
Betty!
Betty!
Betty!
Betty!
Betty!
Betty!
Bitch!
Yeah hoe, y'all niggas don't know though, that's it."
19,Blow the Whistle,2006,Blow The Whistle (2006),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have super powers
Rap 225 thousand hours
Get it calculated, do the math
I made 1,000 songs that made you move you're a***
And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump
Where you get your beats?
I heard 93 rappers say b*** like me
2 singers and 10 comedians
And I'm still gon' yell it every time you see me in
What's my favorite word? B***
Why they gotta say it like $hort? B***
You know they can't play on my court
Can't hang with the big dogs, stay on the porch
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Where you get that from?
Grab the mic, spit one, let me hit that b***
Pimp-C, 8-Ball and MJG
Keep spittin' that P to the I M P
Bun-B, that's Texas, baby
Ball and G, that's Memphis, baby
$Hort Dog, that's Oakland, baby
Ain't nothin' but pimpin' these days, G
My n*** C got locked up
But these real h*** still know they gots to f***
Give a f***, what you say
$Hort Dog f*** with UGK
Do you really wanna be like me?
Spit game like Snoop and TIP
Pretty girls in the V.I.P
They came with Dre, they don't need I.D
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Your mind is gone, your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last 3 days
Poppin' p***, it goes down for real
Don't stop, just keep rollin' down hill
Crash and burn, can't stand, fall back
You're doin' too much, you can't handle all that
Man, it's been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs
Like me, my s*** gets around
Leave the country come back and hit The Town
I'm in Miami, New York and ATL
Houston and L.A., ask Dave Chappelle
About my rich b***, he got her from me
And made 50 million dollars, I'm proud of you D
But I'm crazy, you don't wanna be like me
I come from East Oakland where the youngstas get hyphy
Blow it
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

Damn like that? Can't even speak?
I ain't tryin' to fuck, just tryin' to holla, say whassup
Let me ask you somethin'?, baby
Is that a wig or a weave?
What you see is what you get
If you don't like it, fuck you, bitch
You look good, you hot as shit
But you broke as hell and ain't got no whip
I ain't yo' type, I don't care
Get a light skinned nigga with long hair
I spoke, you act like you mad at a dude
I don't give a fuck 'bout your bad attitude
It's in me, I'm laced with game
You get a signed autograph with a face to blame
Tear it up later when you hate my guts
Right now, I wanna make you taste my nuts
You hella fine, but I don't wanna keep in touch
All I wanted was to sleep with a slut
I wanna fuck you, bitch, 'cause you got the look
A top notch, but you ain't too hot to be shook
Broke bitch
You can't fuck with me, you can't afford me
Broke bitch
You can't even afford a happy meal from McDonald's
Broke bitch
Five dollars worth of gas, where you goin' 'cross the street?
Broke bitch
You just wanna marry a million dollar ballplayer
Broke bitch
You wanna get you a nigga in the NFL
A basketball player, tall as hell
You might get lucky, marry the champ
But when you walk by they say there's a tramp
The stock is low, you don't know what happened
Yo' baby daddy is low budget rappin'?
You wanna do it big, spoil the kid
But you're still at the club out hoein? a shit
You tryin' to hit a lick, no doubt
You want diamonds, all you get is dick in your mouth
Bitch, you need to stop and think
You act like a dick is a slot machine
Are you serious? You can't be thinkin' clear
It's quicksand, bitch, you'll sink in here
You wanna be rich, you better stop that shit
You never hit the jackpot
Broke bitch
Yeah, we tryin' to get top notchers, nobody want your busted ass
Broke bitch
Quit buyin? all them knockoff purses and clothes, bitch
Broke bitch
Always starin' at the ground, you need to hold your head up
Broke bitch
If you had some money you wouldn't be wearin? them raggedy ass shoes
Broke bitch
There's too many women, can't stop a player
I see one I like, I'ma stop and stare
I don't need plans, I'ma take the chance
I don't even have to ask the bitch to dance
I'm a natural, I don't need luck to win
I'm the kind of nigga that'll fuck your friend
And you won't know nothin'?
Every time I see her on the low we fuckin'?
I know them buttons and I hit 'em
Most of the time I get 'em
I got a million lines and I spit 'em
When I wanna fuck, who do I like to call
I throw a little party and invite 'em all
They never argue and fight with a brother
And I like when they like each other
I told Polow I'm never getting? married
I don't give a fuck if you was fuckin'? Sherri"

I won't fuck witchu, so don't fuck with me
I'm just ridin', sidin, whippin and dippin
I look at all the young hoes trippin'
It's no big deal when little hotties get hot
When niggaz get jealous, somebody get shot
You in love? Might make you lose your mind
That's why I run these gray girls, two at a time
With no discretion, to me you're so depressin
Actin' like you don't know, my profession
I look at them thighs, and look at them titties
Take your ass straight on out, of Sin City
Wearin all pink just like Hello Kitty
Bringin' back all C-notes and no fifties
{*Scratched: ""so damn.."" ""..fresh"", ""word""*}
Burnin rubber on these bitches, so fast...
Burn rubber as you smash all fast
Tell it like $hort, no ass, no pass
All you Santa Claus players, be on your way
With a bag full of toys on the back of your sleigh
You hit your girls house, one by one
Climb down the chimney, and give 'em all somethin'
You trick, don't come around me frontin
Talkin' 'bout how you pimpin' givin' hoes what they wantin
You worse than a studio gangsta
Behind closed doors, gettin' his bootyhole spanked up
You suckers disrespect the game
All these video hoes out there spittin' your name
You love it when they make that, ass clap
But she don't give me no cash, I'll pass it back
... I kick her where she stash the crack
In the plastic sack, when she crash the 'llac
Punk bitch!
{*Scratched: ""so damn.."" ""..fresh"", ""word""*}
They tryin' to give the rap game to some real punks
It's just like when disco, killed the funk
Can't tell me nothin', when I know I'm right
Like a bowlegged bitch with a overbite, that suck it right
Player this pimp don't lie
How many porn stars you know that went to Crenshaw High?
A lot of fuckin' for a whole lot of nuttin
You just wannabe noticed so you're out there sluttin
I never really cared about popular fame
It's all about sittin' on top of the game
So don't stop till your panties drop
Fuck the mayor, the preacher, and a cop
You better tell him what it cost, get his mind on track
'Cause he look like he lost
Bring him back, and dig in his pockets quick
Steal his watch, and make sure he got a drop, beotch

Fast women, liquor and music
Wearin' out tires, quicker than shoes
Fast cars and the best of smoke
Pass that w***, I don't mess with c***
But I f*** with Hope
She works for the service so I won't go broke
Now watch me serve it
The cops see me swervin'
I did two donuts
That's when the O.P.D. rolled up

Got the pedal to the metal and I can't go slow

Hey, you never met a nigga like me
I don't think you ever met a nigga like me
[E Dub] Woo!
[$Hort] Ay Lloyd, I can't even name all the R&B bitches I've fucked

25,Buy You Some,1996,Gettin' It (Album Number Ten) (1996),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Whoo! Ah ah, ayah, ah ah ah
And you don't stop, ah ah, word is bond, word is bond
Now introducing the sound from the ghetto
E Double and Too $hort, what the fuck you thought?
I come with the ruckus, It's My Thing when I swing
I'm Born to Mack, always strapped, with the black gat
Who out there I swear boy wanna get touched
Roll up, and catch a slug to the chest, so DUCK
I talk the talk, walk the walk, now nigga
Five hundred S drivin' with hand on trigger
Crazy Lestat, check my track record
Everything I touch is gold since eighteen years old
So what that mean? I roll the blunt
And puff the indo smoke in it, I trip in a minute
Crazy holy doctor holdin' me 'cause I be rockin' B
Sewin up like Monopoly, nobody's stoppin' me
Dig it, Funkdafied like Brat, how's that?
I stick and move on tracks while I smoke a twenty sack
Who said the E can't rock? That's bullshit
Suck my dick and get a big fat lick of my balls
You wanna brawl? Punk I thought not
You might get beat down and stomped like Sasquatch
Your girl, like Keith Sweat, I wanna fuck her
Psych, I already stuck her
I got rhymes to make your whole head swell up
Here's an icepack homeboy shut the hell up
I rock the mic with Too $hort, y'all niggaz know what's happenin'
Everything he touch goes platinum
Eyeeaaaah!
I made a half a million in a week
And every nigga on the street got a tape playin' me
You can't believe it? Erick Sermon, rollin' with $hort
Rolled from California all the way to New York
In big Benzes, G-50 up
Now we trying to squash all that East/West stuff
We spent years in the studio makin' funky tracks
Signed a bunch of niggaz with some tight ass raps
It's like Father Dom, it's like Keith Murray
Makin' millionaires but it ain't no hurry
'Cause we all in it for the long run
I won't leave the studio until a song's done
And ain't nothin' really hard about gettin' my cash
A big phat house with a million stash
You other niggaz got this rap game distorted
Givin' DATs to the label, straight gettin' shorted
Claim you're gettin' paid, but I can't tell
You keep rappin' in my ear got me mad as hell
You talk a good game but I don't believe in you
Be smokin' lotta blunts but I got more weed than you
I guess I see you on the charts in the meanwhile
Another face in the crowd plus some freestyle
Wishin you could be in the light
Promoters pay me ten G's just to breathe on the mic
Bitch! $hort Dawg puttin' it down with the E Double
Shhhhh! You remind me of my phat gold chain
Some of y'all are just small change
Be a boss with true true game
Yeah yeah
Dig this y'all, my Music is Dangerous
Atomic Dog, coming through the smog with $hort Dawg
Ah! Quick with the trig Jack be nimble
I shoot like G Mob goes liftin through my window
Chik chik pow! How you like me now?
The man in the mirror it don't get no clearer
$Hort Dawg, the E Double, and Breed we roll thick
Like girls in C.A.U. with the good power-U
Owww! Money is the key to fame
So I can live it up with the girls on Soul Train
The impact, major league dough like Dave Justice
Yo Breed, $hort Dawg, show 'em how we bust this
Like some true pioneers, don't forget it
Put the money on the table, let's split it
We got enough G's here to make us both happy
Tell them fans we ain't runnin' no coke factory
It's $hort Dawg the real pimp of the century
Girls get wet every time somebody mention me
I was known for my mackin back in eighty-four
I want it all, that's what I keep stackin for
Have things that a rapper never dreamed of havin'
And I can tell them how to get it just keep rappin'
Life's a battle, headed for the new sun
So many ways to get paid, you got ta choose one
Now some of the ways to get paid out is runnin' your mouth
That street life will keep me tight, I'm talkin' bout
Gettin' green, dolla dolla bills y'all
That's on the real, somethin' you can feel y'all
Many claim to have game but you can get that on sale
But ain't nothin' they sellin to you but Arbor and Gail
I mean Sprinkle Me homey 'cause I'm bout dollars and cents
And if you ain't haulin dollars well you ain't holler
In FlintI'd rather dip dip dive, so-socialize
Get loot from the Great Lakes, West to Eastside
You tramp, trick, HACH I spit
Undergrade if you ain't gettin' paid like this
The hours of the ATL paves my name
Spittin' Mr. Macker izzer are you still in the game
See I gets paid by the movement of the cut
I've been summoned by the cancer, to testify and bless
It's that, big mack, like scripture is a phat Kodeje?
So hide your hoe from me
Southern am-bassador, knockin' at your door
Leadin a click that's true, checkin' knowin' all fifty-two
See, all you tricks, best behave
It's that Southern nigga mack from the city of the Brave
I got the platinum caul, yes yes y'all
So plant me with the green and them hoes and we can big ball
Yeah, now we rollin' four deep
Double dosin, relaxin, and maxin to $hort and these beats
E Double, $hort Dawg, Kool Ace
In the place, and be all but bring you straight horror
Representin money
Buy you some nigga"

Roll'em up, In the town, We get down
On the green and the purple, Never on the brown
'Cause when ya hit the O it's the real dope, From Humbolt
Have ya flyin' real stupid like Dumbo
They love it when it comes from California
You'll never be an +Outkast+ with that +Stankonia+
(E-40)
Smell the aroma, Smells so lovely
Man that's potent, What y'all smokin' man?, Orange Ruffie
Where ya from, You from the Yay, I'm from the Valley J
Man y'all some fools, You California dudes do not play
I though you thoughtamajig, I though I told you my nagga
Game colder than a six pack of soda my nagga
Northren Cali, 23's on my Denali
Gettin' rowdy in the Scrillacon Valley

When I'm in for a show first hit up the store
Four boxes to the neck, Alcohol to follow
Get it on fa sho, Every zone I go
Tip toe to the door, Room 3-0-4
Put that town down-lo, It's that Town endo
Guarenteed, No seeds, In your town we'll blow
(Ant Banks)
Now homie tell me what that yay like
Livin' that Bay Life
We put it up in the air, From sundown to daylight
And the girls they be lovin' it, Cause it freeze on em
That Cali-O sensation lets us squeeze up in em
It's a whole 'notha mind state, A way of livin'
That playalistic feelin' gives you the vibes of a villain
Help ya focus, And I was gone when I wrote this
Just trippin' on that Cali-O, Its known to be the dopest
(Chorus with minor variations)
(Too $hort)
It's been 10 years since I moved from Oakland
I traveled everywhere but there's nobody smokin'
Like the Bay and LA, From San Diego up Seattle's way
Ain't no shake like a rattlesnake, That Budwiser make ya get smart
You say you went to San Francisco and left your heart
But don't leave that orange sunshine on the coast
I know that you think the green and the purple is the most
Out in Cali you get choices
One hit will have you hearin angel's voices
Make you wanna fly, And catch the next plane to the West
So you can fill your brain with the best
Now Mary Jane was a small town girl
But Cali-O, She's been all around the world
She'll make the coldest player go broke
You don't hear me though, That Cali-O ain't no joke

B*** disrespect me, get off in her a***
Pullin' h*** cards, time to learn a lesson real quick
Ask me, ""What's the definition of a b***?""

I was so glad, when they said unto me
Let us go into the house, of the gangsters
(Petey Pablo)
If you don't call this gangster, I don't know what a gangster is
If you don't call this gangster, you don't know what gangster is
Said it's one thing to be real, but real ain't all a gangster is
If you don't call this gangster, you don't know what gangster is
I know
(Petey Pablo)
I was so glad...
I only smoke with the folks that came in when I came in
I don't smoke with bitches 'cause I don't know where they mouth been
Dawg I'm a celebrity, I got fans, I don't need friends
I don't need security, 'cause they ain't checked me when I came in
All that you impressed with, is what I already did
The life you choose to emulate, that's the life I live
Dream house, dream car, quarter past that
That money that you makin', was my champagne tab
Dawg, that's yo' girl? Be cool, relax
I just need her tonight, call the phone, you can get her back
You gon' ball then ball, you gon' mack then mack
Your mouth sayin' one thang, but your action don't say that
You told me all aboutcha, and I ain't even asked
Look at ya, nervous, jittery, can't stare me in the eyes can ya?
Real recognize real, you can't deceive a gangster
Short Dawg, Petey Pab', what was y'all thankin'?

If you don't call this gangster, I don't know what a gangster is
If you don't call this gangster, you don't know what gangster is
Said it's one thing to be real, but real ain't all a gangster is
If you don't call this gangster, you don't know what gangster is
I know
(Too $hort)
I know you wanna live the good life
New car, new house, what it look like?
You'll never see it, tryin' to be somethin' that you're not
You runnin' to the car cause you don't wanna get shot
But at the bar you was hard
Ain't even no straps in your car, you better call the law
They got guns, you got a cell phone
Do some gangster shit, and get the hell on
... You talked all that shit
But a bunch of ass-whuppins, that's all y'all get
Actin' tough in the club
You found out you was fuckin' with some thugs; put them hands on ya
So fast you ain't know what happened
Outside seen 'em ridin' in a fo' do' cabin
Tryin' to kill you, this shit is real fool
You won't survive in the streets if you don't know the rules
(Petey Pablo)
If you don't call this gangster, I don't know what a gangster is
If you don't call this gangster, you don't know what gangster is
Said it's one thing to be real, but real ain't all a gangster is
If you don't call this gangster, you don't know what gangster is

Uh; Black Continental, suicide golds
Gators hit the flo', I ain't payin' at the do'
While you fly outside, waitin for the guest list
And to get frisked, it's niggaz like me creepin' with heat
That'll burn ya crisp
I'm at some work, you would open your mouth to kiss
Why you at the bar, roused off Cris'
No longer courageless, grabbin hoes by the wrist
Chose one, mix wasn't hit, so you wet her clothes
And said BITCH - put it on thick, like Lonzo in ""Training Day""
Not knowin' she with a clique, that's aimin at your face
Soon as they get word, hope your friends don't desert
And valet got your Benz parked next to the curb
You ain't a gangster, L7
Quick to bail out, like a nigga in jail stressin
A lesson to be learnt, bout what a gangster is
Not only do we roll deep, so do a gangsteress"

We all need to be strong, for the ones we love
Cain't hesitate to help the next man up
Pass the game like it's a hot potato
Gotta do it now and not later
You wanna say somethin', preach it
If you know somethin', teach it
Cause it makes no sense to keep it to yourself
That's how you felt
Well you might feel better if you spread yo' wealth
Let it trickle down... cause yo' crumbs
Might be just enough for me to get some
I'm tryin' to come up, you know I'm comin'
But it's hard for a black man without a good woman
If you find one it might be your last chance
You ain't never gon' hold down a black man
You need to choose me, get this money you can have me
Ride in my Caddy, and call me daddy
(Too $hort)
You've got yo' momma, you know how that is
A good mother's gon' do anything for her kids
But you never kenw your father, he never bothered
Your last boyfriend used to grab you by the collar
For nothin', wasn't even tryin' to get money
Fine woman like you, I don't find the shit funny
You need management, not an amateur pimp
Who don't know what to do, when the money ain't cool
I'm a hustler, I always eat good
Fat house in the hood, new shoe on my foot
Things ain't been the same since he put you out
Somethin' you ain't never felt good about
Let's get this money, that's what I want you for
Don't make me wait too long, cause life is too short
She said gladly, and then she had me
Jumped in my Caddy, and called me daddy
(Too $hort)
You tryin' to convince yo'self it's the right thing
Once upon a time you had nice dreams
Now you don't sleep good, whatchu thinkin' of?
Nobody cain't tell you how to get that love
It's right here, I know you understand me
I'll be your daddy, I'll be your whole family
No stress, never have to worry 'bout a thing
The best restaurants, furs and diamond rings
All paid for by the suckers and lames
All you need is me in this motherfuckin game
To the top, that's where we goin'
Where the good green don't stop growin'
Don't ever turn on me
Give me everything you earn for me
Be together forever, never lonely
Smoke my last weed, a big fattie
Ride in my Caddy, and call me daddy"

Wasn't old enough to drive, but I still bought a car
Ten years later, he was sellin coke
Fuck with the nigga he was killin' folks
Had to do a couple of niggas or he would've caught the crome
Hopped on the plane, straight got gone
10 years on the run, still in the game
Bounce back through the town ain't nothin' change
Caught a murder beef, but the shit was weak
Charges got dropped in less than two weeks
Nigga went through alot, but his bnk is fat
Tried to catch him up with them wiretaps
But that snitch thean told
Its simple and plain
You can clown all you want, but we still in the game

I wanna fuck this bitch; I wanna hit that shit
I want her to suck my dick - can I get it real quick beitch?
She's shakin that ass, but she ain't no whore
(What is she?) She's on the dancefloor wantin more
(She's a freak) Alcohol
She went to sit down and was about to fall
She's too drunk - but that's cool
I'm bout to take her to the old school
Big freakin (yeah) at the house drinkin' (yeah)
I do this every weekend
And on the weekdays, I do the same thing
Gettin' all this love that the game brings
I cain't sing - but my songs made me rich (pimpin')
Now watch me break this bitch!
I wanna fuck this bitch; I wanna hit that shit
I want her to suck my dick - can I get it real quick?
I wanna fuck this bitch; I wanna hit that shit
I want her to suck my dick - can I get it real quick beitch?
I walked up to her, and said, ""Whassup?
I love the way you dance, I bet you can fuck""
That's when she blushed, I started spittin' it
Give me two hours, I'll be hittin it (up in it)
Gettin' it, while the gettin' is good
I made her grab my dick, I knew she would
And when she felt it - it was on
She said, ""Take me home"" (sure did)
And two rubbers later, she was whipped (whipped her)
Forever my bitch
But don't trip - 'cause I ain't (I ain't trippin')
It's small things to a giant"
33,Can't Stay Away,1999,Can't Stay Away (1999),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Yeah that's right baby
You rolling to the sounds of Too $hort
Album #11 (Just Can't Stay Away)
You knew I couldn't stay away (can't stay away)
Dedicated to the funk baby
That's how we do this, we been doing this
So I made a new album
Fresh out of retirement
I can't stay away, I'm ready to ride again
I could do it for the money, I'd rather do it for the fans
Break out my old caddy, I'd knew he'd understand
See I don't stop rapping, so how could I retire
I had to re negotate, Cause the stakes were getting higher
Lawsuits and jail, partnerships fail
Didn't have a drivers lisence, so I was always making bail
Three years ago I told Jive: get my scrill
They gave a nigga millions with the same shit deal
You know I gotta live so I might as well learn
I'd be the first motherfucker to tell you I got burned
So I retired, started all over again
I put the game down like an Oakland pimp (Oakland pimp)
And now I get paid like the NBA
First class on that ass, every game we play
Fuck your attitude bitch, you ain't hurting me
I'm felling to cool, I'm rolling three times Barkley
You can get your ass out and walk home
I'll find another young broad and get my fuck on
So please don't trip, in my cadillac bitch
Maybe some other time 'cause I ain't having that shit
Right now I'm about to lean to the left
Wipe that frown off your face bitch I mean what I said
I'm bout to bump this beat, I'm wasting time talking
Keep fucking with me and they goin' find their ass walking
I'm to the next level, but I keep on rapping
This shit I be doing just ain't suppose to happen
What you know about the motherfuking east side connection
Hitting backstreets in my motherfucking oldschool flexing
Niggas on the eastside we ain't no punks
Made 'em get four way stop signs and speedbumps
Always highspeed chasing everyday and night
They call me $ir Too $hort bitch you better say it right
I had to look past rap music and R&B
I be a leader and watch this niggas follow me
I could be 40, album 15 it wouldn't matter
I probably got way more rhymes then all you rappers
I know I got more songs then you ever made
I stayed on the charts and I stayed paid
So don't come around me bragging 'bout the shit you achieved
'Cause I know excalty what you and me need
To be in two different places all the time
I ain't concerned with yours so stay the fuck up out of mine
I own all my shit so you can't destoy it or enjoy it
Unless I say so and motherfuckers better know it
If you living really good it ain't nuttin but fate
I love to see a new rapper doing something great
When I hear a funky base line I always pay attention
I spit these pimp ass rhymes cause hoes love the way
I mention pimp shit all the time
18 years of making music, I bring square bitches to my house
And watch her straight get loose wit it
Too $hort baby can't never stop funking
I've been doing this for years and I got hella songs that bumping
All you hang-around-a-long-time, one-hit-havin'
Got no love for this rap music, you need to stop rapping
I thought you was jealous of my bitches and cars
But you just mad that your shit ain't hitting like ours
I'm so real about these beats, I tell all my freaks
At the studio, bitch don't bother me
It's all about the funk, live bass
Trinity, MPC, JV-2080, dump some chords with the vintage keys
You hear what I'm saying, learn from my example
Break out the instruments and stay away from the samples
Get your publishing for everything you write
Instead of selling it keep it for the rest of your life
So just take my advice and don't quit
'Cause if you do, you won't get shit, beyatch
$Hort Dawg on the motherfucking microphone spitting that real game
Album # 11, Just can't stay away
Its on, Once again its on

I told Breed these young niggas think we gettin' old

Used to have sky pagers now we got two-ways
We dipped to my house and let the beat crank
So many placks on the wall you can't see the paint
But its loud, you know how wild your friends get
Ballin' so long been through three body styles and big Benz's
If I cut it, in the garage
I'll make the bitch think I'm the wizard of Oz
Click yo' heels three times you swear you seen magic
Now she's a star, she used to be a maget
Her pussy went platinum, that's what I heard

Why...
Why...
I'm a junkie, lookin' through my book
I can't be cured, I know I'm hooked
I gotta get out the house, I'm so hard
Chasin that cat all over the yard
But why, do I chase the cat?
Been at it so long since way back
Why would I wanna be a player for life?
Spittin' this game every day and night
I'm talkin', body language, facial expressions
Fuck a flight attendant on a layover session
She's servin' my dick
Fallin' in love, but she ain't my bitch
Why do I need to be in between her
Since the first time I seen her?
Hit it from behind, now she wanna be mine
I'm all up in her feline
(Chorus: Dolla Will)
Why must I, chase the cat?
She got ghetto ways, plus she pays, give me my money
Why must I, chase the cat?
You see ain't nothin' changed, but the game, pimpin' ain't easy
(Dolla Will)
Uh, bein settled down, just ain't for me
Hold hands, walkin' down the aisle, bout to get married
I thought that once, will never think it again
'Cause I'm a player in the game and I'm playin' to win
It's too many fine hoes to be stuck with one
Too many wet pussies just to be fuckin' one, shit
It's like a disease, like JT in ""Five Heartbeats""
It's impossible for me to be with one freak
You can't live with me, you can't live without 'em
I never would trust a bitch and I don't doubt 'em
'Cause I'm a dog that love to chase the cat
If you a fine bitch, I might put my face in that
If you do me first, then I'll do you
And the game jumps off when the bitch is through
Hoes nowadays be as bad as us
They love to suck fuck and bust fat ass nuts
(Too $hort)
Ever since I was a youngster, new to the game
I was goin' to the mall, baby what's your name
And your number - I never been under
Always been a outright player no wonder
I been through so many hoes in the last 20 years
Bitch gettin' fucked, bring her ass up in here
I keep two or three hoes on deck
Too $hort baby don't take no shit
I'm a pussy junkie, and bitches always want me
But my first love is money
And I'll forever be faithful to her
I won't give her to a bitch just to do her
And play with her kitty
Got some nigga's name tattooed on her titty
I see a gat and jump the fence
My name is $hort Dog and I'm a pimp, bitch
(Chorus: Dolla Will)
Why must I, chase the cat?
Cause you know... she's a ho...
Why must I, chase the cat?
Whaddya know... she gives me dough...
Why must I, chase the cat?
She got ghetto ways, plus she pays, give me my money"

Put it in her mouth
She brings me paper
Takin' niggaz home, turnin' niggaz out

See I made up my mind when I was only a child
That I would hang with the big dogs, runnin' wild
In the streets chasin cats, they lace these macks
Everywhere you go you know we take these gats
So they treat us like kings, they never try to play us
They wanna play with us 'cause they know why we players
I got it from my daddy, boy go tell your momma
I'm watchin cartoons man, I won't, I'ma just
Keep it to myself, and when I'm grown
I'ma get a lot of women and get my pimp on
Like you, and now that's what I do
Got a bunch of broads just like the fuck I knew
I ride through with a few, only top notches
Hoes so fast you can't use stopwatches
Untyin 'em, so when you firin 'em
Bend a bitch over try to rip out the linin

Went at hollered at $hort, come pimp with a player beotch!

If ye ain't got no food I ain't goin' in ya house
A lil' nigga, freshly chilled
Ma, I don't drink no beer
I'm the big type nigga in that frozen weather
Chinchilla, rammin on that soft-ass leather
I'll fly in any weather, I pluck my own feather
Swine on the G9, pocket full of cheddar beotch!

Got new bitches, quite a few bitches
Too many hoes, that's my life, and you wish
It was just a bunch of lies, cause you know it's the truth
I stick and move cause these hoes'll do
Just about anything for the low-low
Sometimes I daydream about my old hoes
But mostly I just look for a bitch like Stella
Do what I tell her, and get my mozzarella
(Birdman)
I'll break a brick like I'll break a bitch
Run a hundred miles to put some wheels on a whip
Kool-Aid, candy bars, Cadillac, whip
Silver and gold, barbecue out bitch!
On them slab kitted out real slick
Mommy dressed up in her brand new fit
Tailor made Louis and she ridin' on 23's
D-boy, Birdgirl, I know you know me

We ain't worried about how to treat a itch
Bitch better worry about how to treat us

Can't be broke, selling coke
Fat ropes, shattered hopes
Fresh cars and all that dope
Baseheads keep the trade alive
Nobody know about a 9 to 5
Everybody's just trying to survive
You need a gun, can't use those knives
You got a bullet? Well just pull it
And if you trip, get pistol-whipped
By a psychomaniac sick in his head
Wanna be a gangster, now he's dead
His brother took over, ain't no sweat
Bought a new drop-top white Corvette
Now he's buying keys, making G's
And all the girls say ""Won't you please
Take me"" In the City of Dope
See I'm hard as hell, no ghetto tale
You play a gun, but the game is real
You want to stop my money, how?
You keep smoking, I'm selling out
It's called the City of Dope, might be your town
Get a piece of the rock, turn your life around
So cool, don't even trip
You got the sack, get on the tip
A resident in the City of Dope
And every day I'm selling coke
I'm never broke, I don't smoke
I sold a rock and made you have a stroke
Pay cold cash you know, I won't need Bruno
I'll hit you with my gat and then I won't come back
Like ym peanut butter top with the candy paint
All the high school tenders drop down and faint
In the City of Dope
Life in a coke town, heard it before
Think it's all been said, but it's so much more
It's like midnight, slanging rock
Task force just hit the block
Time to make a move, the spot got hot
You chase a cop, homeboy why not?
She lit the match and light the crack
Ain't giving no bitches no kind of slack
Or if you're playing the game, you're thinking the same
Goddamn that rock cocaine
I've seen a lot of my friends go off that pipe
And every night smoke coke that's white
So when you get up, man, there you go
You and that pipe just dogging the hoes
In the City of Dope, and the story goes
Want to be like free, breaking millions of loaves
In the City of Dope, where the color is gold
On your neck, and your fingers, and your brand new Rolls
Enough said, but my rap won't end
It's on a one way trip to San Quinten
Like you my friend, ain't nothing new
You want to grind that boat till it's way past two
You say it's not easy, that you're so hard
Sporting gold tone Z's, not credit cards
Got clout turn 'em out, you got bitches
You say you're not fake, but I'm telling you this is
The City of Dope, might be your world
Get a beeper homeboy and just sell that girl
I'm from the town called ""The City of Dope""
It couldn't be saved by John the Pope
So go on, live your life of crime
The beat'll keep beating while I say my rhyme
In the City of Dope
Smoking weed, rolling 'em fat
You wonder where the boy learned to act like that
Hey was raised in the ghetto and felt the need
To roll a fat joint and smoke that weed
But the tale goes on and years went by
Another drug came and the boy got high
Ever since that day, he just wasn't the same
Where I come from, we call it ""rock cocaine""
Where you come from, you might call it ""crack""
But wherever he went, you see he never came back
I tried to tell the motherfucker, but he don't know
I say to coke, ""Pimp that ho""
I don't live in a mansion but I drive a Benz
Cut to the turf and collect my ends
Say ""Look here freak, kick me down
I don't have time to talk right now""
Got to go to, my next hoe
And get kicked down, a little more
Left right left, down the street
Getting paid freak by freak
There you see me, there you don't
You wonder will I, or won't
Is it yes, is it no?
But does it really matter you freaky hoe?

She just like to freak
And she had to pass me that pussy
You can't stop the bitch
Let her roll on those and then drop her rich
My name is short
My game is long
I freak these hoes
And sing these songs
I know a bitch named Stephanie
Do anything she can to have sex wit me
She really don't bring out the best in me
But I love her fine ass layin next to me
She's like another freak named Nicole
So damn sprung on my diamonds and gold

I fucked her so good she told her friend named Angie
Angie called me up about two weeks later
Talkin' some shit about do me player

I guess ill pull it out and just cum on your bitch
Like my other little tramp
Named Erica
Anywhere I wanna fuck
That's where I fuck
'Cause she's the frekiest bitch in America
And every time I get the pussy
I just tear it up cause
Biotch
And it don't stop to the beat"
41,Coke Dealers,1983,"Greatest Hits, Volume 1: The Player Years 1983-1988 (1993)",Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Now... I come from the Oakland town
Task force roll and rock, cold cracked down
Young brothers my age making dollars so long
Drive a brand new Benz with a cellular phone
See him draped in gold, we call him Big Bank Bob
Got a ring for each finger and he can't get a job
Call him trash, he supplies for the dopefiend's tweak
But what you make in a year he might make in a week
Cold cash money is the answer to life
Feedin fat hovers to a dopefiend's pipe
Gotta keep rollin', just can't stop
Only two worries are a thief or the cops
People keep sayin: it's all so wrong
But the rocks roll strong all night long
Another Park Street life, the age old story
And now the coke dealers take all the glory
They're the ones you meet big time on the street
I say the coke dealers are now the elite
See, the average dopehouse will take your soul
Trade it for a rock and do the same with your gold
But if you think about it really it all sounds silly
Smoked out Willie in his washed off Philly
Open up shop down the block
And everybody's tryin' to get a piece of that rock
Coke dealers
Big time, baby
Smokin'
Coke
Cocaine the demon, it knows you well
Sellin you a trip to a place called hell
You never even thought you'd get hooked
Starin' in the mirror, scared to look
You think about life and think it's cold
Like drivin' with a ???? down a rocky road
Now the rock man is your best friend
The only one you talk to time and again
You even tried dealin', but that's no fun
Before you made a sale it was in your lungs
So the coke dealer now lives on your life
Like a four year marriage you're the man's wife
You can hate it with a passion, but you won't fuss
He's the driver of a Caddy and you're ridin' the bus
You think it's not fair, I tell you it is
'Cause he bought yours and you bought his
Bought his cars, his clothes, and he bought the coke
Now he looks good and you look smoked
It doesn't take much to realize
All you gotta do is just open your eyes
You're cold bein pimped by a rock in some glass
What's it gonna take before you fall on your ass?
Bankrupt, smoked out, just simply through
Cold street walkin' with a hole in your shoe
Coke dealers
Big time, baby
Smokin'
Cokeland
I once had a homeboy rollin' strong
Sold coke all day and all night long
He made a lotta money and bought a lotta stuff
But soon he went broke and it didn't take much
First he started smokin', and all that he figured
Was the more he sold dope, you
See his bank got bigger
But my homie thought wrong 'cause he could be stopped
The vice squad rolled and the boy got popped
He was out on bail before he made it to jail
Wasn't about to do time when he's doin' so well
Say he had a lotta money and some real good friends
But he was almost broke when he flipped again
So he got on his grind, he wasn't wastin a day
Opened up shop and started pumpin the weight
He thought about the boys that he could not pay
So he hustled by himself thinkin' that's okay
But one night he was chillin' with a freak named Carol
His door was kicked in and he was starin' at a barrel
The brother with the gun saw him tweak on the base
Walked right up and put the Uzi in his face
He said, ""Give up the dope if
You still wanna breathe
I tell you one time, you better listen to me""
As my homie got robbed he lost the fight
And now he's just a smoker probably totin tonight

- So what are you saying Todd?
To all you bitches, hoes, and all that shit
Here's another rap that I'm ready to spit
It goes like this, my name is $hort
I'm tearin shit up like never before
Pimp slaps, makin' snaps
Cold cash money and Too $hort raps
Oakland, California that's where I'm from
The city where the boys say you don't want none
But if you do, I'm gonna tell you this
() Ain't really shit
Wanna roll so hard, all of the time
You and that bitch playin' Too $hort rhymes
If you aks me, what it's all about, I'll say it's about that money
But if you aks me, could you have some, I'll say it doesn't concern me
Ronald Reagan came up to me and said, ""Do you have the answer
To the United States economy and a cure for cancer?""
I said, what are you doin' in the White House if you're not sellin cocaine?
Ask your wife, Nancy Reagan, I know she'll spit that game.
Like one night, she came to my house, and gave me a blow job
She licked my dick, up and down, like it was corn on the cob
What is life? It is Too $hort
I play the bitches like it's a sport
Yeah, I'll play the bitches just like y'all
Like Dr. J played basketball
You can call me Too, don't say it twice
You'll get me real mad and I'll fuck your wife
You see I'm not proper, I'm rarely polite
Too $hort, Too $hort, don't say it tonight, beeatch
It started on a bright morning in 1987
I was in my drop-to Caddy y'all
Gettin' sucked by a bitch named Helen
Nasty bitches, around the world, I wrote this rhyme for you
You might not like my rap, but I'm tellin' you bitch it's true
So much death in the Oakland streets
Am I gonna live till next week?
Will I get shot by a dope fiend,
Tryin' to get high, tryin' to steal my ring
I really can't say, 'cause I don't know why
People out here droppin' dead like flies
I used to see a home boy givin' five
Now I say, ""Man, you still alive?""
Cold as hell, the town I'm from
Won't last too long when you're fakin the funk
I'm the master rapper, so unique
Clap my hand when I want my freak
You can't deny it, you know I'm right
I turn any rapper out when I'm on the mic
And I won't kick back, or relax
Till he knows I'm the best at the MC rap
Till he knows Too $hort, set the track
They got him caught up in my serious cap
Muthafucker can't spit straight game on the mic
'Cause he's worse than a fag or a Frisco dike
He's a sucker MC, I call him punk
You try to spit that rap, you can scratch that junk
You little punk ass boy, wouldn't listen to me
Think I'm fakin but I'm takin' all you sucker MC's
To the end of the world and push you over
Good luck couldn't find you in a four leaf clover
If I ever said a rap, tryin' to cap on you,
I wouldn't even sweat it 'cause you'll be through
Lookin' so far up, you might fall down
Gettin' clowned by the hound from east Oaktown
And the look in your face when you're lickin' that tooth
Could make a grown man die, laughin' at you
'Cause you're a, no rappin', no rhymin
Played out fake ass simple simon
I never understood one word you said
But you're swearin up and down that you're killin' 'em dead
There's only one thing, I wanted to know
Sucker muthafucker, where's the joke?
I'm the player of players, just call me Pop
My name is Too $hort, no I don't stop
I just don't stop mackin, don't stop cappin
Don't stop rappin' now you see what happens
Your mind is gone, your crew just cut
Sucker MC I'll tell you what
Your rhymes are weak, your rap the same
And when it comes to game, you are lame
Never even heard of Too $hort baby
Hit Oakland in 1980
Singin' mo raps than a rap could rhyme
Tellin' sucker MC's don't waste my time
There's a girl I know her name is Betty
Straight to the head just rock it steady
She's so freaky she'll juice you up
All the home boys just can't get enough
She's a Ph.D., don't even stop
In the back like that goin' (top, top, top)
I won't say white girl, won't say she's black
She's the kind of girl that make your knees go crack
Feel the beat, rock with me
Let me tell you what I be
I'm a MC rapper, a MC rapper
A big bank roller and a cold, cold capper
Hey baby, I got this rhyme
It's not gonna stop till the end of time
Like rock and roll I'll play that song
To the beat all day and all night long
So liten up, to what I'm sayin'
I'm a Oaktown mack, bitch I ain't playin'
To all the home boys doin' time in the pen
Gonna rock this beat for you once again
If you can't get out and you're mad as hell
Say beeatch, now make it sound for real
I'ma tear shit up, if I get the chance
I could give a fuck less if you're hole don't dance
See I'm a big mack now, I'm so great
I was born and raised in the Golden State
Call me T.O.O., if you say $hort
I'ma rap my ass off till you give me some more
Big bank, now just make me rich
Bitch bitch bitch bitch make me rich
Check out my style, baby I don't quit
I heard this freak say, ""That's the shit,
He took the cake, fucked the rake
Too $hort baby damn sure ain't fake.""
But the sucker MC's are screamin loud
Sayin' Sir Too $hort, shut your mouth
How can you talk about me, and call me weak
When your father smokes coke and you mother's a freak
So I keep on rappin', if nothin' else
Keep your jealous thoughts to yourself
Bitch and Bitch, he's a MC right
Ain't sayin' nothin' but he's holdin' the mic
Fuck with me, and boy you're doomed
I send a trick with a hoe to the motel room
'Cause I'm the coldest MC on a microphone
Like a .357 pointed at your dome
I got cap for cap, you never heard
So fresh again with cusswords
Muthafuckin' shit, fuckin' with me
Fuck a sank bitch and a sucker MC
Cusswords, just let 'em know
Muthafuckin' shit, god damn ass hoe
Cusswords, just don't quit
Muthafuck you damn shithead bitch
It's Too $hort, on the mic, and it don't stop
And it don't stop, and it won't stop, bitch

Walked in the house and got shot in the head
I know you don't believe it, if you do you're wrong
How can I die and rock it all night long?
I'm too $hort baby, spit that rap
I put oakland, California on the map
It's so hard, got you telling lies
Can't hold me back so you say I died
It's incredible, I came back to life
I never let 'em bury me without my mic
I keep breathing, don't stop that breath
Now everybody's talking about too $hort's death
Am I a zombie, or something close?
I'm not casper, I mack all the ghosts
Oaktown style is the only way
I catch a new freak every day
It's not the yellow brick road, it's called the foothill strip
Stand on your toes, make your heels go click
Three times, it's no place like home
So why you wanna bury me all alone
I bring a new meaning to underground rap
Dead or alive, I'm still born to mack
Always on the pop charts, straight rapping
I'm not dead, I'm just macking
So as the word turns, I'm a living soul
I even heard a rumor that I overdosed
I'm not a reincarnation of something old
Like king tut I was buried in gold
Why you wanna cry when I'm still living?
Word got out and the rumors started spreading
My momma, called one night
Said todd, are you all right?
The whole family's got the too $hort blues
I heard it last night on the evening news
And that's bad, it's not even true
I told my momma like this let's sue
So many times, I heard I died
I guess I'm like a cat and I got nine lives
Well I'm the p-l-a, y-e-r
I lay bunnies, like hugh heffner
I'm her flavor, kinda saucy
I lay back and let the young freak toss me
Even if she don't like serving a pimp
I'm still living, so let's do it again
I keep rapping, hard as hell
Cause your rumors make my records sell
If you continue, I'll soon be rich
Riding around town going biiiitch!
People always say too $hort can't rap
Now I drive a benz and my bank is fat
It's like crap, put a c on a rhyme
Ain't nothing left homie but a scandalous crime
I'm the best damn rapper you could ever hate
Say I died on the freeway in the earthquake
Say I'm washed up, say I'm through
But the fact still stands I'm better than you
You got rhymes? well I got more
I take you on a trip to my rappin' store
You find rhymes and raps, poems and caps
Way more raps than any rapper could rap
'Cause if you rap like me, he wouldn't have to be
Weak on the mic like my boy MC
It don't stop, to the funky beat
I know you like dancing with a real big freak
I can't dance, but I sure can rhyme
I sold a million, in '89
And if you didn't know baby, it's the 90's now
Old short dog got a new breakdown
I went to miko's, fresh candy paint
Now I'm doing things that the suckers can't
If I was dead, they'd call it dead man's rap
But on the real, short dog is back
Funk funky, off the parliament
I'm still living, so let's do it again
It's incredible, even if I die
I never let 'em bury me without my mic
I bring a new meaning, to underground rap
Dead or alive, I'm still born to mack
I say what's up to my homies in santa rita
Right about now I know you need a
Too $hort rhyme to get you through the day
Oaktown style is the only way
I came up, and now I've sworn
To rock this mic till I can't no more
And that's game, straight pop the most
MC rapper from the west coast
Too $hort, dead or alive
I still chill on the eastside
'Cause I remember how it all began
House parties in east oakland
Now it's on the pop charts, still rapping
I'm not dead, I'm just macking"

(E-40)
You took her she went from the
Ghetto streets, to executive streets electronic beeps
Two-way pagers, Palm 7's, M-11's
Illegal weapons, mesmerized by the dope game
Smith and Wesson's, never went back for seconds
Sprung... SPRUNG?
Not on yo' dick dick (but what) but on yo' tongue tongue
Jealous (jealous) overprotective (protective)
E'ry chance you get, you slack bruh
(Too $hort)
Domestic violence, she got you whylin
Do yo' thang, I don't understand how you get mad
Cause you fuck around to beat her ass
And she don't wanna be around you
Now you miss her lil' funky ass breath in the mornin
Call her up, tell her how you want it
To be in love you gotta pay yo' dues
The bitch got you singin' the blues, nigga
I can't tell but I need to know just how you feel
I can't hold it inside I've got my pride so tell me what's the deal
Is it love, or just could it be, that you're used to me?
It's been some time but you're still on my mind, so baby talk to me
(Too $hort)
Domestic violence, that's what they call it
You don't smoke weed and you ain't a alcoholic
Ain't nothin' wrong, with bein in love
But you act like a fool when you see her in the club
It's like me and my money, ""Can't Stay Away""
Together, twenty-fo' hours a day
Real love - but can you tell if it's real?
Bitch you better tell me how you feel!
(E-40)
L-U-V, luv (LUV!) Backwards that spells EVIL (evil)
Connivin, triflin ass people (people)
Uh - kinda soda (?)
Wifebeater tanktop, restrainin order
All up in her kitchen (in her kitchen)
But have you noticed how she fuck different (different)
It ain't the crevice that you wanna shank
It's me - 'Fat Bank Take Little Bank', BEO-EO-ITCH! ... SHEEEAT!
I can't tell but I need to know just how you feel
I can't hold it inside I've got my pride so tell me what's the deal
Is it love, or just could it be, that you're used to me?
It's been some time but you're still on my mind, so baby talk to me
(E-40)
I was in the jun-gle, Marin City
Get some butt she set me up and never let me fuck!
It's about approximately 20 minutes past the hour
I'm in the Eddie Bauer
(Too $hort)
It's so comfortable, we can't fuck around no mo'
You makin' deals, you need to clown that ho
But you forgive her, can't live with her
Can't live without her - but you doubt her
(E-40)
Love (LOVE!) Sometimes spells catastrophe
Elizabeth, Marcia, Daphne
He wanted mo' sex (mo' sex!)
The bitch stole his Rolex (Rolex)
(Too $hort)
You know why? The bitch shouldn'ta been trusted
Do you wanna love her, do you wanna fuck the bitch
Makes no difference, handle yo' business
If it ain't love, then what the fuck is this?
I can't tell but I need to know just how you feel
I can't hold it inside I've got my pride so tell me what's the deal
Is it love, or just could it be, that you're used to me?
It's been some time but you're still on my mind, so baby talk to me"

Why you wanna treat me
(Lady humming)
(Too $hort)
I was raised to cope with life
Make my own choices and hope I'm right
It's uphill all the way for me
I ain't goin' down or slowin' down don't play me G
I'm not the child of a millionaire born to be rich
Don't have a trust for the lust for one I get a bitch
So quick and all the stuff we have
Make her jealous girlfriends lust for cash
But fuck 'em 'cause while we on a whole different level
They still be sleepin' on the floor in the ghetto
And when they realize how you came up
Them hoes can't say nothin' 'cause the game is rough
(Chorus with Too $hort and lady singing)
{Why you wanna treat me like that?}
'Cause you don't know how to act when you're dealin' with a mack
{Why you gotta be like that?}
I ain't givin' no bitches no kind of slack
{Just want you to love me back}
I can't love you 'cause you're nothin' but a rat
{Baby please don't act like that}
It's like that you should've stuck a knife in my back
(Too $hort)
Now bitch I don't slang no crack
I can't go back to rappin' in my cango hat
You wanna put a little game on that?
How lame is that?
You fuckin' with the same ol' rats
We all have ups and downs
You're stuck with frowns and don't make a fuckin' sound
But let a nigga hit the lotto
Pop some bottles and tell everybody you got 'em
Now I done been on both sides of the mountain
For the bottom to the top and back down again
And all the way I give a hoe a fit
Not to wear it but to ??? little lonely bitch
You cryin' like a baby need a pacifier
You (pass a fly?) watchin' life pass you by
You couldn't make it to the top in an elevator
You think I want a sorry bitch?
Never player
(Chorus with Too $hort and lady singing)
(Too $hort)
You're like a little baby with a shitty butt
You city sluts they say you can't get it up
And then they say you're way too hyper
Game is lighter need someone to change your diaper
But don't stop just give it all you got
Till you're hot even if you slang dope and get caught
It's like goin' platnium and gettin' dropped
You don't get no money you get props
But you're not 'cause you're really just dreamin'
I'm leavin'
I keep these fake hoes steamin'
They screamin'
She better face those demons
It's fuck season
Don't waste my evenin'
I believe him when he said the end was near
It's in the air a whole lot of pimps in here
I can't (com) pare 'cause I've been mackin' twenty four years
But since you wanna go there bitch I really don't care
(Chorus with Too $hort and lady singing louder)
{Why you wanna treat me like that?}
Bitch don't know how to act when she's dealin' with a mack
{Why you gotta be like that?}
I can't givin' no bitches no kind of slack
{Just want you to love me back}
Bitch I can't love you 'cause you're nothin' but a rat
{Baby please don't act like that}
It's like that bitch stuck a knife in my back
(Too $hort talking and lady humming/singing)
It's like that
That's why I treat you like that
{Don't act like that}
Bitch x2
{Why you wanna act like that?}
(Get) the fuck on
{Baby please don't act like that}
{Oh no}
Better learn the rules of the game
{Don't act like that}
You don't know how to act when you're dealin' with a mack
{Don't act like that x2}
I ain't givin' no bitches no kind of slack
{No}
I can't love you 'cause you're nothin' but a rat

49,Don't Even Stop,1985,Players (1985),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"($Hort)
I'm the young emcee that don't rap too long
Everytime I spit a rap is a brand new song
Always coming that fresh is so cold
You wouldn't have time to look at my world
'Cause you be dancing to the beat having a ball
Then I'll tell you to give me a call
I'm Too $hort baby I always say
When I'm rapping to the beat I don't play
I'm on the up and up so for real
Rapping that rap realer way real
Working that suckers everyday striving to be hard
Stacked with bean pies in the back of the car
Playing Too $hort in your stereo
I couldn't even hear your radio
'Cause just can't quit it short done took it
Found it like a tag ain't nothing but amusing
Just being short you think I'm small
But eye to eye I stand too tall
I make not make sense but I make mail
The beat don't stop and I just can't
Keep on going and I just won't stop
Too $hort over don't even stop
That's how I am that's how I jam
Just don't stop rapping when I regress
Being a rapper ain't everything
They madder now lost they change
On the short watch the cops say let's got
Raps to raps rocks to rhyme
So many raps all the time
Making raps everyday and still can see
The dope with a ride won't come to me
I spit raps every week of the year
Rapping on the mic just screaming snitch
My homie T rocks came hit me up
Went in the studio came hitting it up
Always catching the flash out of the cap
No hoes it's all straight rap
No breaks no fakes just straight man T
And I always know what to do
The girl the other day just block up
Too $hort baby might just walk up
To me and she had to act Too $hort sews the rap
When I told baby all yes I am
We were walking down the street holding them
She said Too $hort spit that rhyme
And next thing you know that freak was mine
Girls going wild seeing female funk
Riding in the cut just hugging the back
Call me short and the girls I play
Love Too $hort when you hear me say
Girl that's your life
Girl why you smoking that hype
To the girls girls all the girls
Real long hair or short curls
Here's to you a special toast
It's all about you 'cause I'm the most
If you hold it down let me hear you rap
Fresh to the beat don't even stop
Everybody on the mic or the floor say Too $hort
Suckers don't know that rapping game
Spitting on the mic can't even hang
With these sucker emcees every check
Rapping like this they will soon begin to realize
That rap is made to be tamed and ticked rush released
To the rap fans that can do like this
Just rock to the beat don't fade that shit
You probably wonder about rapping what does it mean
To thing with wondering things
Spending fresh leather what does it seat
Got a bright color you know it's cheap
Not loud enough to make an elephant speak
Put them to your homeboy mack
I'm all about rapping but it ain't like that
You better tell your homeboy don't make me laugh
I'm the too s.h.o.r.t. I don't rap wacks
I'm a too emcee all you sucker rappers hanging with me
It's a shame 'cause in the bay they won't let it be
Keep on lying and see what happens
Too $hort baby just won't stop rapping
All I can do is just keep smacking
'Cause Too $hort baby just won't stop rapping
Yes tip roll the strip
I'm going to take your mind on a serious trip
Like a video like I'm tight hoes
Girls just rolling like leave me alone
Even though I'm on my back still let me in
If I did it to the front I'm a do it again
Sir Too $hort won't even stop don't stop
I'm here to stay 'cause I'm so cold
Riding round town dripped in fold
I'm the laughing man laughing all night long
Got freaks out there freaking to my song
Couldn't put backstabbing thevies to work
I'm putting biching emcees to the whole earth
Spitting them tenders on a wild goose chase
Up in the hills making my place
Getting raps getting traps found and clowned
Everytime you see short baby you get down
'Cause the raps I make are the raps you like
The way Too $hort rocks the mic
This one of a kind rapping style
Had the freaks in the back just going wild
When I spit that line what's the deal
Bitch bitch bitch make me rich
I have such a good mannered mind
Sometimes I might make dirty rhymes
But these are just some dirty times out fresh"
50,Don't Ever Give Up,2001,Chase the Cat (2001),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Yeah you know, we always tryin' to get this money, that's what we do
It ain't easy... but I'm tellin' you, it ain't hard either
All you gotta do is keep hustlin man, don't ever give up
I don't care what it is, handle yo' biz
Forget about the woulda, coulda, and if I did's
Cause that's just the past, you know it never lasts
And you know how time flies by so fast
Look at rap music, they said it was a fad
But now it's takin' over, and I'm so glad
'Cause I never stopped rappin', but that's what I do
If you quit yo' thang, you might never find the truth
I had choices in life, I coulda did somethin' else
I did what I wanted to, I did it for myself
Now whatcha gon' do with yo' life
People try to tell you what to do, it's yo' life
You better make the most of it, live to the fullest
Think positive and don't dwell on the BULLSHIT
I can't tell you no better
If you thinkin' 'bout quittin, don't ever
Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin'
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up, you just cain't!
Comin' up is hard, givin' up is easy
You always get the game from your homey Too Sheezy
I keep it so real, never spit it false
I hope you make it big and if you ever fall off
Remember these words, it's only what you make it
Anything is possible you want it better take it
I ain't talkin' 'bout stealin, felonies'll ruin it
Stupid all I'm talkin' 'bout is takin' opportunities
Doors open up and when you get another chance
Either hold up the wall, or get out there and dance
It's on you, do what you wanna do
You know why everybody always punkin you
Talkin' shit they know you're bluffin, won't do nothin'
Sittin' on the shelf like Stove Top Stuffin
I know you had enough and want to call it quits
Believe me, this ain't it
Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin'
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up, you just cain't!
Isn't hard to see, use your eyes
It's time to tell the truth, 'cause we through witcha lies
Utilize all your steppin stones, gotta be prepared
Sittin' 'round dreamin' how you bout to be a player
The years and the time fly, you ain't even workin
Went by overnight you went from 18 to 30
Nothin' goin' on, never set a goal
Dreams can't come true, and now you gettin' old
You start to represent, everything you hate
But don't give up, 'cause it's never too late
All you need is a plan, a purpose and a model
And quit livin' life like you 'bout to hit the lotto
Get rich on your own, buy a new home
Keep your real friends, leave them haters alone
I see you when you get there, rollin' to the bank
I know you cain't let go, I know you cain't
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin'
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up, you just cain't!
Nah we can't give up, gotta keep hustlin for life baby
It's hard on the black man, tryin' to get my stack together y'know?

Yeah you.
Can I ask you a question?
You like to fuck?
Oh, you don't want me to talk to you like that
Will you like to make love?
I saw you walking down the street, and I had to stop
Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good, and your so fine
Young tender, would you be mine
I get you in my car, drive you to my house
'Cause I'm a mack, I cold turn you out
I won't ask, and I sure won't beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work
What time is it, don't watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and I'll rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am, and I always can, Freak Nasty
I'm the man
I take you out to the finest restaurant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers, I'll buy your ass a rose
But later on your coming out them panty hose
You want gold, girl what's next
It's me and you, doing the sex
So now you know I'm just a freak
Give it up baby, I can't wait to weeks
I want it all, Don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't
Nigga please
You provoke no feeling
You must of forgot, the girls of who you're dealing
We haven't the urge, to get busy
Like those dizy lizys, who used to dance for you, your through
I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted
You're addicted, to the words you inflicted
Time after time, line after line
Talking 'bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you $hort, because of your height or your width
Dis me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky, you're a dinky
It's an easy task, to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
You're a freak with no tale
You have no ass, class, you can't pass, your simply trash
You're a typical nigga, the kind you don't take home
???? Tights and Barbie from the dangerous zone
Like a $hort dogg that carries fleas
You make my ass itch, twitch, don't you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits cause your all up on it...
Get mad if you want, I won't front
When it's time to hump, won't be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too $hort baby all in them guts
I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet
Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet
It's just a freaky note, from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew
Like every other nigga in my crew
I bump hoes, now it's your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Won't sell you though, or sell your blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby, You know what I want
Your acting like it's that time of the month
Are you bleeding, can't think about sex
Irritated by your Kotex
We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck
I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck
Now here, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't...
Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer
And most definitely, not a dick pleaser
You dreaming, and scheming, and fiending for my lust
You don't have enough
For you I feel disgust
Wait, smoke things I hate
For goodness sakes, If I wanted someone small I would masturbate
I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream
When I say too short, you know what I mean
You see, I need man, not a boy to approach me
Your lame game, really insults me
Your name is Too $hort, or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny
Little boy, your not a player
I'm your savior
To try to get at me, shows of gracious behavior
I have to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy, here's a proposition
You wanna bit of danger, Step you to my zone
You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home
With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining
Jealous of you got some, nigga please your lying
'Cause I fight the feeling, that would have to be one
And mathematically, me plus you equals none...
I am the rapper that they call 4 tay
I'm gon tell you like my homie $hort Dogg would say
Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then it's cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang, but she said no
That's about as far as it's going to go
So I toss and turn, to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep, that's how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you ain't with it
The rest of you freaks just won't admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Ain't body tripping 'cause I know I'm right
You could be black or you could be white
For a (low bass) girl it really don't take to long
But a (low bass) girl's always trying to turn ya on
With a little squeeze, but it's just a tease
Give it some time, she'll be on her knees
Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt
Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut
But don't get me wrong, cause you started it all
Coming to my house in a Cam or ??sump??
But when it's time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight, don't want to serve it
Gave it some time, so make up your mind
Don't fight the feeling, this time to own whine
You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
But I'm Rappin' 4 Tay it don't make me numb...
Yeah man, the little hoes got ill
So now it's time to get way to real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank hoe
Go get your bank hoe
My little dick'll have you screaming though
Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up
Your still playing that finger fuck
See I'm a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts, not big mouths
I know some little girls'll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down, give you some head
But little girl, you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain 'cause your way too young
So at this point, I can't really say shit
Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch... Bitch!"

Can I ask you a question?
Can you Get In Where You Fit In bitch?

You heard 7 get ready for 8
That's right, bitch
$Hort said 8 of them
Don't believe me
Start countin' while I name them
Don't stop rappin'

Talkin' about smokin' that glass pipe
Players was the wickedest
And that's the realler
But I still came hard on coke dealers
Raw, uncut & X Rated 'born to mack, Life Is Too $hort is where I first went platinum

55,Don't Hate the Player,2000,You Nasty (2000),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"(Too $hort)
Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)
But what if you ain't no player?
Everybody talkin' bout they gettin' hated
All these lies is bout who they been datin
If you never was a player, I cain't hate you
You know life is one time, you cain't take two
You seem to think cause you ain't fuckin' mo'
That some other nigga's all up in yo' hoe
It ain't yo' fault, did you do that?
You think yo' ex-bitch, gon' ever take you back?
Hell naw, you still thinkin' you a player
You only got one girl;
You just a square from nowhere
You starin' at the ground, fuck the ceiling
Love is the word that describes yo' feelings
You're hooked, you can't leave her alone
You're like O.J., wait till he brings her home
You wanna kill her, but you don't wanna play the fool
You never was a player, we cain't hate you
Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)
But what if you ain't no player?
What you mad at? Your bitch let me have that
And I ain't even say shit about your fat ass
She chose me, don't get an attitude
It really ain't got nuttin to do witchu
I'ma fuck her - anytime I wanna
Like a dog, I'ma climb up on her
She don't sweat me bout my other broad
But you called her on the phone and said I'm just a frog,
I beat up hoes and I'm a rapist
Then you told all your homies how I hated
Damn nigga! I don't even know you
I seen you actin' like a groupie at a show or two
I know she knows, the way you lied
Last time I hated it was 1985
I was young, caught up with a bad bitch
I took my time, learned the game, I had to have the shit
Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)
But what if you ain't no player?
She said you had a little dick, and can't fuck
Other niggaz fuck her good, but you ain't up
Can't do that stuff with a freak, can't never be weak
Cause a nigga like me'll put a dick in her cheek
And to the beat, I start humpin on her face
Grab her by the ears and then give her a taste
Yeah nigga, I fucked her and she's mine now
You know I been a dog for a long time now
But I ain't gon' fight you for this pretty hoe
You think somebody player hated, you don't get it though
Just can't figure it out, and you never will
Your bitch went out and found her a better deal
Said it was cool, kickin it witchu
But she has more fun when she's lickin' on dude
I hate to be rude, but you know the rules
Life is the game nigga - you lose
Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)
But what if you ain't no player?"

[TS] Beyotch!
[8B] Yeah, you know how they like it baby, nigga you can't retire!
Verse One: Too $hort, Eightball
From nineteen-eighty, through eighty-eight
I Don't Stop Rappin' like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell 'em instantly (instantly)
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me (pimp in me)
In eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
A bunch of fine bitches tryin' to sleep with me
Every night, sold out, turnin' young hoes
Tell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes
Always fucked up in niggaz bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin' on twenties wearin nice clothes
But ain't nuttin like pimpin' hoes, and ridin' Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad, to get to the point of havin' this
Opportunity, for you and me to pass it on
Two years ago, I thought it'd be my last song
Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin' white boys, bumpin dopefiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin' it
Niggaz like Lil' Tim was out there ballin sellin cakes 'n' shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin raps
All about my snaps, tryin' to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin it with rich niggaz in rollers, and candy sixes
Deliverin hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggaz who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
$Hort Dawg, I don't know why you tryin' to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin' more than them niggaz movin weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin game, now let's get out here and make this loot
Chorus: Too $hort, Eightball, MJG
[TS] I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
[TS] I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
[8B] We some presidential players, with money by the layers
[8B] Ain't nothin' you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
[TS] I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
[TS] I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
[MJ] I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
[MJ] and meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes
Verse Two: MJG, Too $hort
I had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin' crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin' eyes scarred, bein weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin' straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
Was rappin', sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
I live the fast life of a MC
And I sell a lot of records makin' pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck till the mornin, sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highway
Verse Three: Eightball, MJG
My way (pimp till I dieee) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin', niggaz ain't knowin', how far this shit is goin'
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin' bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'
Eightball got flow, MJG
Here comes the one they call the P-I, M-P, never will retire
The tree-high, green leaf, helps me to get higher
Eightball and MJG, Too $hort, we all must be
The pimps of the industry, shit people pretend to be
Fuck so why should we, settle down
Leave the kitchen put the kettles down
Stop from fillin all you hoes
Give up the life of trues and vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen, this shit too deep
So I hooked up with my comrades so we can all get rich, nigga
[8B] Yeah yeah, one time, for your motherfuckin mind

[TS] $hort Dawg in the house, slammin' Cadillac do's, pimpin' hoes

You down with Too $hort girl? He a ho
'Cause I'll snatch a bitch up e'ry show, and hit the mo-mo
But certain niggaz fall in love with them hookers
Nigga the pussy ain't yours cause another nigga took her
Seen a little mo' game, she took a rang and some bigger and better thangs
Starin' at the chain and the karats in the rang
Now who she wanna leave with, she know we got the sticky
The niggaz wearin dickies or the niggaz givin' hickies
She know what she want, she want that California funk
Them hundred spoke thangs with that juice up in the trunk
She wanna ride down the sho' with the top back
But she know I gotta hit before we start that
Man don't trust her
(Aiyyo) Man, see that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about
(What?) You can't trust a bitch!
(The fuck you mean?) What'chu mean? Where the fuck you been?

Now do you love your nigga or do you trust your nigga?
Nigga what what, what what wha-what?
Now you thinkin' you be trustin yo' man, but I'ma tell you right now
The peter man make the plans
It's like when I step up in the club I gotta catch my breath
9 times out of 10 I cain't help myself
I don't really mean to cheat, I ain't lyin' I'm a freak
Pager goin' beep and I'm steady tryin' to creep
I admit, I'm a - sinner
I did what I had to do just to get in her
I simply whispered in her ear
Tell her I'm the man, tell her what she wanna hear
Now I'm knowin' I can hit it
Cause the shit was soundin good 'cause she bought it and she bit it
I'm down with $hort Dawg, I'm the next thang comin'
You heard Badwayz? Yeah I'm the first one
My name Stud baby girl, you ain't heard of us?
""$Hort Records: In Platinum We Tru$t?""
I hadda died if I wasn't high - you ain't heard that?
But matter of fact, I got some weed in the 'llac
We can finish these drinks and go smoke that shit
And from there, ain't no tellin' where we gon' get
But don't trust her
That's the type of shit I'm talkin' about (what?)

Oh yeah baby what's up? (I know what you doin' out there okay?)
Bitch, what the fuck you think I'm doin'?
(Well as long as you bringin' that lucci home to me baby)
Now do you love your bitch or do you trust your bitch?
Now do you love your nigga or do you trust your nigga?
Nigga what what, what what wha-what?
You see it's way after 12 and I'm out wit'cho bitch
Tossin up, while you workin on the midnight shift
Got you fucked up mad, bout to start a rage
She won't answer the phone, won't return your page
Gettin' took for what you got yet you treat her real dapper
She takin' all yo' change and she spend it on us rappers
Fuckin' all in yo' house, bustin' all on yo' sheets
When I come to yo' town, I be doggin yo' freak
Then you come back home lickin' all on that ho
Would have a fit ever knowin' she was suckin Joe
She love money and excitement, that's why y'all always fightin
And youse a workin-haulic, she want you to be ballin
When it all falls down, you cain't trust that bitch
If she make you too mad you might bust that bitch
Be locked down in county for assaultin shit
But for love and the pussy you done bought that bitch
Don't trust her
Don't trust her, don't trust that bitch
Now do you love your bitch or do you trust your bitch?

Nappy head niggas like myself
Get a bald-head and say: 'go to hell!'
But you's a snake, you's the one
You bald-head bitch, you need a perm
So much game when the homies tough
I make a bitch go who never sucks
It really ain't life but I just met her
Now I'm sayin': 'bitch, suck better!'
Fuck you, stupid hoe, tell me just what you know
I came to the party and turned it up
You say: 'ouh, he's got a dirty mouth!'
But, bitch, I kept talkin' shit
Mothafuck you, damn shit-head bitch
I wanna blowjob and I'm not kiddin'
Work it in your mouth till your head starts spinnin'
I'm that nigga you'll answer to
If I say: 'bitch, jump!', that's what you do
I'm a fast talkin' conman blowin' your mind
Breakin' you and your cousin at the same time
With a dirty rap comin' out my mouth
And you know damn well what I'm talkin' about
I'm the too $hort, baby, way too cold
So mothafuck you, bitch, goddamn ass hoe
The dope fiend beat...
For all you junkies to just ride...
H-e-a-d, I need a doctor just for me
To suck my dick like a vet
To give me head until I sweat
She gotta suck dick
So I can tell all my homies just what she did
She sucked and sucked and she's a bitch to the beat
I'm too $hort, I said my name is too $hort and it don't stop
I love you bitches for the blowjobs
I just laugh over and over
When the bitch drinks sperm like it's soda
I straight start aimin', would I miss?
Get back bitch, I wouldn't never kiss
I say she looks so good and she's so big
But, man oh man, that bitch can wimp
If I wanna I could rock her
But I can't fuck no-head doctor
Bitches don't know that's too $hort's tip
You might get geed if you don't suck dick
But I'm so fresh, I'm so down
I tell you bitches the other way around
If you do me first then I do you
So the game jumps up when the bitch is true
Soon as I come all in her mouth
I smooth get dressed and roll out
I'm too $hort, baby, fresh fresh again
One MC, one bitch broken
I tell you, baby, playin' just like that
I'm the best of the players to the ice cold vet
And, bitch, you just a bitch
You work fastfood and you think you rich
You see, my game don't stop when it's on the one
I love to see you when you work that thang
Gettin' real busy at the back of the car
Rollin' down the skyline boulevard
I say: 'bitch, what are you smokin'? '
A big fat dick in the big east oakland
I see my homie, he needs to quit
She was walkin' down the street
With a big fat bitch, maybe I'm wrong
He might get every two weeks that welfare check
Oakland, California, is the city of snakes
Pimps, pussies, players and fakes
The big oaktown, the city of liars
Fresh storewires and voltaires
A strip, bitches, nasty freaks
My raps, homeboy, with tremendous beats...
She's a bitch to the dope fiend beat...
All you junkies just ride...
Bitches on my mind
I can't hold back, now it's the time
To bust a left nut, right nut, in her jaw
Opened eyes and guess what I saw
Bitches on my mind
Grabbed the microphone and then I started to rhyme
What would life be if it wasn't too $hort
It be nothin' but rappers from old new york
But that's not likely and there's no doubt
Bitches like me 'cause I'm turnin' it out
I'm here, there, everywhere
Sportin' fat gold rope, I'm a mothafuckin' player
Recognize game when it's on your face
As you dip to the beat and you feel the bass
Crook it up loud, would be doin' fine
Pose like a pimp and check my rhyme
Some young tender doesn't like this beat
But a bitch ain't nothin' but a word to me
I can check her, wreck her, or just get paid
Cut to the house and freak my maid
You see, she doesn't speak English but we don't talk
I call her lucy and she's juicy, makes your eye balls walk
We never hesitate to make good love
She clean up my house and then clean me up
So check it out, you bitches
I tell you a story of rags to riches
So check it out, freak nasty
I know you're fine but you look like lassie
Bitch, not a long ago I used to hang at the mall
Top floor, baby, all the freaks I called
And if they didn't wanna come that ain't shit
I just drop a few lines and then call her bitch...
Bitch!"

I tell you about a freak that I met
Short got heat when the funk got wet
She's the one I won't forget
Got to get that funk like it ain't no sweat
Like a seven eleven on a non stop street
The first young tender was a true the freak
'Cause the funk won't let quit they don't tell me shit
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk
The second gender that I had
Talk about Friday that girl was bad
But young tender and sir too short
Gotta get that funk everyday at fo
'Cause a brother like me pay to in out
Funk that jump bitch there's just no way out
Once was yours but now she's mine
But now I get that funk I sing this rhyme
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk
The dirt young tender that I put
Couldn't understand that torched the but
Big time rapper that's what I am
But in that funk I'm superman
The dirt young tender she's the one
After two whole dates she had me sprung
Working that funk like I know I should
This and sour when I know that funk is good
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk

The next young tender was the fourth
So much love for sir too short
The fourth young tender that I'll regret

New shit new shit, out the door y'all
Shorty Pimp, E-Dub once again
So buy you some of this ghetto slum
Underground music from A-T-L
X rearranged it, Shorty B played it
Me and Shorty laid it, my niggaz OKed it
Carnefious Crawfish, next to slay it
Damn right! We do it all day bitch
Ride around in Benz's, twenty inch rimzes
What Short told y'all, New York to California
We put them high beams on ya - parkin lot pimpin'
With the boom-boom twelve inches kickin, we stay hittin
Huh? The most consecutive
Fifteen albums, we're the executives
Who talkin' money?
(Hook - E. Sermon)
Let's do it baby
Me and Short dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shootin all haters on sight baby
That's right!
Make room, E and Short be on fire!
Everything we do is fire!
This song is on fire! YO!
(Too $hort)
Bitch! That's my favorite word
I cashed a million dollar check on Thursday the third
Now it's flowin like water out the kitchen sink
I make more money every time you blink
Got you scratchin ya head, made you stop and think
He couldn't made all that he must have robbed a Brinks
We been around so long, makin' funky songs
Now you gettin' mad, say this cain't be goin' on
How come E and Short get to stay in the game?
Don't ever talk down on a player's name
So when you see us on top of every chart
You know we been number one since the very start
We feed families; when we rhyme, celebrate like champions
You see mine - I never worry
I don't want the stress, you know my story
I learned how to ball from the best
(Hook - E. Sermon)
Let's do it baby
Me and Short dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shootin all haters on sight baby
That's right!
Make room, Eastcoast be on fire!
Westcoast be on fire!
Down south be on fire! YO!
(Detroit, Chi-town!)
(Erick Sermon)
Don't stop the song now I'm not over
I must leave the scene wrecked, before closure
Highest doja, L.A. weed
Monopolize the south like L.A. Reed (BITCH!)
Sick individual, this here be the southwest coast
Eastcoast material
Erick Sermon, that's what I said man
Fuck with Short and I and be a dead man
(Too $hort)
This is fire, pass it to me
It's so hot, E lemme hit that weed
Uptown, hydro is in my genes
It's like green, I just my be a fiend
'Cause I been tryin' to O.D. lately
And your never gonna rehabilitate me
On a mission since the eigth grade
Keep gettin' high, and stay paid
(Hook - E. Sermon)
Let's do it baby
Me and Short dog on the mic baby
It's going down all night baby
Shootin all haters on sight baby
That's right!
Make room, tonight is on fire!
The roof is on fire!
These hoes be on fire! ..."
70,Freaky Tales,1987,Born to Mack (1987),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"These are the tales, the freaky tales...
The tales that I tell so well...
I met this girl, her name was joan
She loved the way I rocked the microphone
When I met joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met ann, I soked her pans
We ended up freakin' by garbage can
The next young freak I met was red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak was all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin' for my homeboy jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece
She only talks about signin' a lease
I met this tender, her name was lori
And a x-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twinsister, her name was lisa
And just like lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than flames in hell
I geed this girl, her name was tammy
I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was jane
I pulled to the side and I spitted that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespine
Freaked one night with a girl named pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name was janie
She was thirty-two and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I wanna big freak, fat and slobby
I kick on back and I watch her mouth
Two tons of fun, big mama jama
A country-girl from alabama
I met this girl, her name was betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in vegas
She said her name was donna
She was a pitty little freak from china
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm havin' so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named betty-jo
Took her to my home and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I tell you more:
She was down on her knees beggin' to blow
She's like another freak named ren'
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like burger king, she knows the play
But a freak like ren', you can have it your way...
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
These are the tales that I tell so well...
I met this girl, thick as hell
Only sixteen, said her name was linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than central safe
Let me tell you this since we talkin' young
I met another girl, said her name was yvonne
Always talkin' about havin' fun
Once again in the bed I got it goin' on
I'm sir too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I try to get funky like female funk
So when you see me comin' or see me goin'
I keep my money, let the hoes keep throwin'
I once met a tender, she did it for free
On the foothill bust number forty-three
All the way on the back she was workin' me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin' the beat
I met this freak named aunt winell
Macked on the baby like an ice-cold vet
Everythin' she had is what I get
'Cause I'm too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was rita
Baby thought that $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home 'cause I knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again I took a second look
Cause the next young freak, her name was sharon
She kept lookin', well, I kept stairin'
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, she cutted out
I know you all know what I'm talkin' about
There's a freak named shane, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's gettin' thinner
Shane is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's goin' on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was grace
She walked in the door wearin' a lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named belinda
Homeboys call her belinda the blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl slick like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad he blood would boil
But I rapped her off like I'm lookin' a toy...
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
The tales that I tell so well...
Shockedy life, Friday night, it's goin' on too $hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like mary's sheep
I hitted around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was nina and her man's in santa rita
I took her to my home and homeboy, I geed her
Set her on the way the very next way
Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped to this girl, her name was roseanne
We hitted the motel and got it goin' on
Holiday inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named shanie
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg to let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new honda
I was on top and she was up under
The bed hitted the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a datewith girl named kitty
She was so fine with big fat tiddies
All night long she was actin' shitty
So I macked on baby like I was frank nitti
There's another girl, her name is rose
I use to roll baby like brand new volvos
I never saw rose wearin' clothes
She's a pimp house pet, ready to pose
I was ridin' down the street when I met janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to poem it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was bunny
Said I was the only man who ever called her honey
Everythin' I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with shirlie
She was really short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirlie was freakin' like a girl named rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my neval
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the brood up with my homeboy randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was laverne
Baby got tossed and I got it on
I grabbed the mic and started to sing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this: they might be freakin'
But, boy, you never had that t-p-treatment..."

73,Fuck My Car,1996,Gettin' It (Album Number Ten) (1996),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Let's go ridin', sidin, whippin and dippin
I know it's my car bitch, you ain't trippin'
It's your favorite color, on a lovely day
You let me reach right over, and rub on your leg
I'm sayin' all kind of shit, to make you smile
Put your seatbeat on, 'cause I be drivin' wild
You think I'm like them other niggaz, I just wanna fuck
But I like to get money and get my dick sucked
I ain't your average everyday little hoe nigga
And I can see through you bitch youse a gold digger
Tellin' me stories, about the richest man
But I'm Too $hort baby, the bitch's pimp
I come a long way from young and done the certified player
I get what I want, and I'ma holler at you later
If you ain't got game you might think I'm a trick
Don't play yourself girl you won't get no dick
I take you right back home so you can be witcha man
I know you sucker motherfuckers won't understand
See me with a bitch and say I floss too hard
These hoes ain't trippin' on me, they wanna fuck my car
Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin' on you she'd rather fuck your car
She could care less about a real man
All she wants is a man with the meal plan
Pick her up in the Benz and hope she get to eat
Every day is Halloween hoe, trick or treat
I throw your ass in the trunk with a bag of rats
Drop you off at Kaiser like they did in The Mack
I know you're broke, fantasizing like Mariah
Get a grip on my bumper, rub your clit on my tire
You can ride on top or wrap your legs around the frame
But if you get in this car you gonna respect this game
And I'm knowin' that, I hope you know it too
Only real pimps know what I'm goin' through
It's a daily mission, controllin these bitches
Uphold the pimpin', never start sympin
Got the cleanest drop Caddy for your eyes to see
So c'mon bitch and take a ride with me
Now I'm about big blocks, drop tops
White guts ending with much knock
Got loot but dough ain't even trippin' on it
Got keys, to three hundred Z's, knowin' these bitches
Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin' on you she'd rather fuck your car
I gave you a ride for some head cause my dick was soft
But if you ain't widdit I'ma drop you off
I got hoes all around me all day and night
And yo little pussy's just way too tight
For a big black dick like mine to slide in
I take my motherfuckin time and ride it
Cause ain't no punk bitches where I'm from
They like to suck niggaz dicks, and make us cum
So get butt-naked let me slap that ass
Play with them titties while I tap that ass
Slam your face in the pillow, and arch that back
Have you lovin' this dick like it's made of crack
Cocaine, and you know that costs
Can't fuck for free you got to pay the boss
Hundred dollar bills bitch
I break your ass and won't feel shit
Cause pimpin', pimpin', that's my game
I got it from the O where it always rains
Pimp game, now it's time to roll
And take my hoes down to the hoe stroll
Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin' on you she'd rather fuck your car
You ain't slammin' doors like me 'cause I'm the coldest mack
From a brand new Benz to my old school 'llac
You ain't never gon stop my pimpin' style
It's like two plus two, can you figure it out?
You say, what fo', I say that's right
You know the answer nigga pimpin' for life
What's a trick to a hoe, some dope to a fiend
What's a bag of weed if the shit ain't green
You say the game is forever, well so am I
You only got two choices bitch, hoe or die
Now speak up, you better say somethin'
Before I turn your ass back into a pumpkin
Cause ain't no motherfuckin fairy tales
Only Freaky Tales, and I tell 'em so well bitch
Now get your ass in the car
Don't play me too close I won't pimp you too hard
Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin' on you she'd rather fuck your car
Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
If you put your mind to it, you might get far
No need to be a player or a superstar
She ain't trippin' on you she'd rather fuck your car"

Yeah (niggaz desperate to be) nationwide baby
(But don't really know what it means to be)
A new millennium (a real true G)
Niggaz say, there's gotta be a whole different crew on the set
(Gangsters live and gangsters ride)
Just to rearrange the whole game (it's hard to survive, either do or die)
And that's what my niggaz is doin' (in this gangster life)
That's what we doin', come check us out, yo
Us young niggaz came up with nothin' but hopes and dreams
Obscene intentions, picture perfect for the pinchin
A new invention to this dope game, I'm slangin CD's
Instead of cocaine, meanwhile takin' it in and gainin mo' game
My background descended from the hustlers and pimps
True redemption for you niggaz, I blew up like the blimp
Strong attempts to make these power moves, nationwide we devour crews
My momma told me never follow fools
On the backstreets, gat beats, had her runnin' like track meets
Tax freak, class G, servin' up them crack trees
Joe Rizza, rhyme blizza, from the streets till I take my roll
I take control, bank fold, ain't never gon' sell my soul
I stay committed, when shit go down in my town they say I did it
I gots ta get it, and when yo' stash look touched you know I hit it
You won't admit it, we bring it hella from that Detroit city
Nitty gritty, kick so much ass it gets my gators shitty
Niggaz desperate to be
But don't really know what it means to be

Dirty repercussions, nasty destruction, I'm talkin' I'm bustin'
Dumpin bullets in my foes, trigger pullin on you hoes
Born with the soul of a soldier; you don't even know what it means
To be a G well fuck with me and I'ma show ya
The definition, of a killer nigga, get that nigga
Bring him to me but don't kill him, let me deal with him
'Cause I'ma peel him with my scalp, wodie shoulda kept his mouth closed
Now it's gonna scream high notes, like some altos
My nigga the war is true to down my haters and imitators, smash niggaz to pieces
Slash the anger from my gun crucify you bitches like Jesus
Squash beef, respect those when my niggaz roll through
You claimin a side I'm claimin trues when you make yo' move I make my move
Showtime fool, as I think about how you chin checked
Any minute they drop like two bitches beggin to get wet
Have some respect, cause on my team, a nigga marine
Stayin a foot off you scrubs, showin no love to all these hoe fiends
360 degrees fool! Shit, I burn like a Pyrex
So which one of you motherfuckers wanna step up, and die next?
Appetite for mutilation, gangster 2000
An operation no time for debatin, my troops is waitin
We roll like Dayton, wires, we keep yo' block on fire
Not Juvenile, but I crush empires, fuckin' with me
I hurt you, like a Jamaican {?}
My bitch get evil like {?} a nigga murder mad

Game! Is the shit
Like what? A rat-haired bitch
Verse 1: Old School Freddy B
I was sittin' at my home, all alone
Thinkin' 'bout bitches I use to bone
Tight young bitches, I can't deny
Rat-haired bitches, I can't lie
The bitch had body is all I know
Only 18 but looked twenty-fo'
Her name was Bitch, class of '92
Skyline High and the shit was cool
Took her to my house, Moms was gone
Turned off the light, unplugged the phone
The bitch said ""Fred, I hearda you
Anything you want, I will do""
I dropped my drawers, dick all swoll
She couldn't believe the position was pole
In and out, out and in
I used the bitch like a ATM
G'd the bitch like the one and only
Bust two nuts and called her phony
She couldn't believe what I said
The next thing you know she was on my head
Suckin the dick like it's suppose to be done
Rat-haired bitch make me cum
Freddy B that's the name
Rat-haired bitches, I got game
($Hort) 'Cause Game
(Fred B) That's the shit
($Hort) Like what? (Like what?)
(Fred B) A nasty bitch
Verse 2: Short Dawg
I like to fuck a nasty bitch
Witta big fat ass and shit
First lay, dick gettin' sucked
Bitch don't give a fuck
'Cause real players run that game
When I fuck that bitch she won't be the same
'Cause when Short Dawg run up in it
Fuck a bitch for about 30 minutes
Real player-like, straight to the point
Bust a nut while I'm smokin' a joint
Stop fuckin', still smokin'
Lay my dick on her lips, say ""Open!""
Ain't nuttin like a nasty bitch
Acting all fast and shit
Bitch just love to flirt
When I see her at the club, I'll be puttin' in work
Feelin' on her ass at the bar

Crush blue velvet, gameless game

Bounce tp the spot, check my crap

The bass on heat every time I ride
A long haired bitch on the passenger side
Mackin on the cellular phone

Fred Benz, Freddy B
Oaktown, a bitch don't sleep
A motherfuckin mack that's what I am
Taxin a bitch like Uncle Sam
She pays the tax, Fred Benz' the pimp
16 G's put the bitch in
No ordinary game, just give it and take
East Oakland can't be fake
I slapped the bitch, the money was short
Macked on the bitch and now she knows
Fred Benz baby, the game is fat
Ask these bitches, I'm a mack
($Hort) Game!

'Cause that's what I was raised to do
Break these bitches, get paid fool
Y'know Short Dawg ain't afraid and hurt

Man, we ain't fuckin' with that fake muthafucker MC uh...
Whatever that muthafucker name is, man we got a real crew
We got Muthafuckers over here rappin' for real
Eatin' pussy on records and shit, that shit ain't what's happenin' we got some real shit.
Tryin' to be like $hort muthafucker. You know what I'm sayin'?
Dangerous music got some mack shit for your ass, boy
Fuck him up, $hort.
Get In Where You Fit In, fool
You was a mark up at the High School
Now your hardcore like cb4
Biting. What you wanna be me for?
It's your life, you wish it was a Too $hort rap
But you got's no game and your bass ain't fat
You need to quit, rappin' just ain't your place
So back on the grind and don't catch no case
Bitches, that's what you always be
Like the other young bitches that try to get with me
I run all up in it but this ain't no race
I pull it out and shoot it right in her face
You probably wine her and dine her
And get jealous when you can't find her
Your nothin' but a mark
I bet you get your ass kicked hangin' at the park, bitch!
You'd better watch your back
Before you get jacked by a nigga with a gat
'Cause Life Is ... Too $hort, I'm in the house like that
$Horty the pimp, was born to mack
And I don't stop rappin' one thing I never do
Is stop makin' this funky ass shit to ride to
And other rap crews can see
Dangerous Crew got the funky beats
And when I see ya and act like I don't know ya
I'm like missouri 'cause I can show ya.
Why is my shit so funky it sanks?
Pee wee, shorty b & ant banks
You outta pocket tryin' to hang with my crew
You might of just learned, but it ain't nothin' new.
What happened to your funk, did you lose it?
Or did you get juked by dangerous music?
We stole all your money and all your songs
Done you like a hoe and then sent your ass home
One punk came and went
Had to fire the hoe, but I'm still a pimp
""MC"" lawrence ""the fake gangsta""
Would've never been shit without the bad ass banksta ""the little punk""
Now he's gonna play on out ""like a mark""
Had to put his fat foot in his mouth ""little bitch""
Quick to say I'm sorry when your funny
Y'all can have him 'cause dangerous don't want him
He'll tell a lie almost every other minute
I'm like bennett, I ain't in it
Go on with your reject rap attack
You'll get more from a prize in a cracker jack
And since banks said he can't have no more funk ""hell naw""
Get In Where You Fit In, punk
It's what life is all about...
Did that get him, did that get it? ""Yeah, you got him""
Wait, it's the end? ""Bitch ass nigga""
You like that shit? ""Hell yeah"" damn, you like that, nigga!
You a fool ""Tore his ass up!"" banks you a fool for that!
""Fuck that nigga"" ""Goddamn!""
Man, fuck that punk ass nigga, man tryin' to fuck with the dangerous
Crew, nigga, you can't hang with this shit, nigga, we got niggas
Way tighter than you man, you old wanna be me asshole nigga, come with
Some real niggas from east oakland, nigga.
I'm a bad-n-fluenz, so keep your fuckin'kids away from me
'Cause the muthafuckin' turf is the place to be
Where hella niggas get shot at
So you'd better pop back, or your ass gettin' dropped, black
'Cause niggas lay you on your back fast
So you'd better grab a gat and pop a cap in they black ass
And let loose the whole clip
And let these muthafuckers know that you ain't takin' no shit
I mean you gotta be a nut, fool
And you can't give a fuck, you can cut nigga, fuck school
Because that shit don't even last long
Get a key from an OG and get your fuckin' cash on
And if a nigga got some grip, get your gank on
But if a nigga poppin' lip, get your bank on
Don't ever go out like another sucker
You gotta show everybody that you the baddest muthafucker
Show them niggas you the biggest boss
And ain't no slippin' stoppin' the trippin' just poppin'
A clip and breakin' them niggas off
'Cause see life ain't nothin' but just riches to me
Gettin' high with my partners and bitches to see
Yep, that's what life is all about
You eatin' the cunt and she suckin' your dick and you
Fuckin' that bitch and kickin' that bitch up out
I ain't a model & I don't play the fuckin' role
Don't be shit when your old, nigga fuck a goal
You wanna be somebody, I tell your ass you can't
You little bad muthafucker, go on and hit the dank
That's how it is in the oaktown.
These muthafuckers didn't know? Well these muthafuckers know now
And don't be jealous and mad we doin' shit
'Cause I don't give a fuck, I'm from the bad-n-fluenz clique.
You wanna follow in my footsteps, well put on your gangsta hat
Burn the sack and don't be ashamed to mack
I'm 'about to tell you how a true player has to be
The shit comes naturally, so hoes quit askin' me
I never listened and used to cuss in back of the church
? Bracking the max? is my birth, packin' a gat on the turf
Ready to drop any sucker on contact
You can't keep me calm, black, so pass me the bomb sack
And watch me extend with a grin to another place
I live on the edge and the feds and the brothers space
But ain't no stoppin' this fool, I'm on a rampage
Breaks out in a damn rage, so don't try to stand, break
Sit in the range, you'll get maimed, I don't fight fair
Strike with a mic, in a psyche is a nightmare
And I'm always usin' my dick 'cause I'm slick with a fly bitch
And Rappin' ass Ron is my psychopath sidekick
2 hardhead niggas, yeah we advocate violence
Talkin' shit to the world 'cause we don't have to stay silent
Steady searchin' for a bad plan, thinkin' like a mad man
Your crew think they tight, but when I come they a sad clan
So fuck it, I'm always causin' ruckus
Whoever wanna disagree then grab my dick and suck it
Diddley is always doin' shit, destructive & I ruin shit
You steppin' pack your weapon fuckin' with the bad-n-fluenz clique.
Fuck it, it's just another nigga dead
I pulled the trigger & I figure lead, that's when the nigga bled
Bloodshed is what I see in the nighttime
Strange and deranged, I ain't in my right mind
I can't relate, I'm stuck in a dream state
A psychopath and diddley dog is my teammate
Swe we a closer, to fred and rubble
So step to bad-n-fluenz and you know you in double trouble
Muthafucker, we the bad-n-fluenz clique
Some lunatics and we known to ruin shit
A terrorist, I ain't never been a role model
Nigga I grab the fuckin' 40 and down the whole bottle
And I don't even like fuckin' with no alcohol
But I'll snatch a joint and get smoked out for y'all
Gettin' lit, never havin' a fit
On the avenue, havin' brew, grabbin' my dick
And if your clique talkin' shit, it's your clique I'm a terrorize
The 9 to your spine, now your ass is paralyzed
I'm dangerous & I ain't even mad yet
I drop with couch and watch you bounce like a bad check
'Cause I'm a mack that's from 8900, bitch
Rappin' Ron and diddley dog and bad-n-fluenz rulin' shit.
Fool don't understand all the shit that goes on up in this nigga's head
>From the hood come if you would but you might end up dead
See these sick ass oakland streets done turned me out
Survivin' and makin' cash is what it's about
Some people ask me why I commit crimes ? there em? a scratch
But I'm black & I'm trapped & I can't turn back
I was raised as a cruel kid
Because the streets taught me more than these fake ass school's did
I tried the education system but I dropped it
So now I'm in the goddamn game and can't stop it
And I'm a muthafuckin' threat to authority
Make the police sweat when they check this wreckless minority
You want more of me, come to oakland, that's where I be at
Sellin' dope with my folks, come close and see I react
Hard niggas addicted to dirty money, fast cars and fine hoes
On the drink every day like winos
And sometimes I be slippin' up off the blunt
So I packs a pump for the punks who wanna try for their stunt
'Cause I would never tell a hoe how I make my green
I cut my cream on an un so I can't be seen
And then I bump up on the block and knock after knock
Watch the cop jock as I create a be a hot spot
Pushin' slugs just to make it
I'm in the game and it's real & a nigga can't fake it
I know it's sad what I'm doin'
And I don't give a fuck, I'm ant diddley dog & I'm a bad-n-fluenz
Nigga you think you got the shit in?
You gotta Get In Where You Fit In, bitch

Spend some, then people start to notice you
Get all the things that you wish you had
Now all that little stuff don't get you mad
And once you get your foot in the door
Don't start actin' like you can't look for more

To get what I got and I'm way too strong
In yo' lifetime, if you don't get yours
Can't do no ballin like yo' nigga $hort

Hell nah they don't know me, askin' is he with us
Back in the day groupies was always bitches
Just throw 'em all 'cause you can't warn 'em
Why you wanna be on stage with me? You ain't performin'
I don't come to your job, tryin' to flip your burgers
I can handle this crowd, I don't need your service
You wanna be my dancer, you must be trippin'
If you ain't got big titties, why you up here strippin'?
You better take that shit back where you came from
Throw it up nigga... go 'head, bang on me
Just get off the stage
Get off the stage bitch...
Get off the stage bitch...
Get off the stage bitch...
Get off the stage

You wanna hug me, and take pictures
Talkin' 'bout you love me, I like bitches
You jumpin' round like we rehearsed this
When I called the girls to the stage you was the first bitch
All in my ear, askin' 'bout a after party
I'm tryin' to do a show man, back up off me
Security shouldn't even get paid
I watched 'em push the ladies back and let these niggaz on the stage
They'll tell you tomorrow, exactly how it happened
They was all on stage with me, while I was rappin'
Gave me women and weed, then we dipped to the pad
But all that really happened was they made me look bad
Get off the stage bitch
Get off the stage bitch...

When all the rappers come to town you wanna stand next to 'em
What you swingin' on his nuts for man, what you doin'?
Go back in the crowd, and stand with your homies
I got niggaz out there and damn you don't even know me
At first, you was just chillin' on the side
Now you next to me, you must be feelin' all right
I don't lip sing, everything I do is live
Your name is Too $hort? Then motherfucker who am I?
Why you celebratin'? Raisin' both your arms
You gon' help later? You ain't makin' no songs
You ain't the manager, on the turntables

It's gettin' close to the end y'all
But we gonna kick it like this on the last album
Verse One: Too $hort
Now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
In you ear for a minute, quit complaining
Bout how you can't spend it cause you ain't got it
You got what it takes but not enough to get started
I hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
Just me ridin' legit, they can't arrest me or bust me
I'm still hungry, I want some more stuff
Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
So get yours, and buy my new album
Peep the game and don't be like Calvin
Get everything you want, get real, get you mail
Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
You should be gettin' it, everything you want
Everything you dreamed of, never have to front
You should be gettin' it, gettin' money
I'm talking 'bout you black, don't laugh it ain't funny
You should get a good lawyer, like Johnny Cochran
Swear to tell the truth, hell no I didn't pop him
Get your kids in school, so they can get an education
Get a degree, and take a vacation
You see I got all my game from the streets of California
Young millionaire with no high school diploma
Livin' real good, taking care of my folks
Roll up a fat one for the players to smoke
Short Dawg in the house, I know you ain't trippin'
Cause Life is Too $hort you gotta Get In Where You Fit In
Stop looking for what you never seem to find
It ain't what you think you got to read between the lines
Cause life ain't long, for a young black man
Tryin' to make money doing all he can
Sellin dope don't ya hope he would go to class
But the boy makes money and he makes it fast
With the twenties on top and the fifties on the bottom
I fuck the top notches oh yes we got em
It's been a long time since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds
Get your money man
Get yours
Chorus: P-Funk
You should be gettin' it
Get it while the gettin' is good, get it while you can
You should be gettin' it
Get it while the gettin' is good (repeat as necessary)
Verse Two: Too $hort
Get your money man, get yours
You should be gettin' it
I know you tired of being broke just hanging out
You gotta lot a dreams but you can't get out
The first thing you need to do is set your self some goals
Think positive, everything else is old
And work hard, never stop hustlin
'Cause they just love to see the black man strugglin
(So what are you saying Todd?)
It's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
He said meet me at the White House and I was there
'Cause I'm one in a million, black man rising
They wanna keep me down but I always surprise em
Spend my money in the hood, I know it's all good
And you should do the same I told you peep the game
Too $hort, you know I'm the man
I lend my brother a hand 'cause I know I can
I keep going and goin' but I'm not the pink bunny
Insted of beatin' on a drum I never stop thinkin' money
I'm gettin' all I can if you don't ya slip
I can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
When I was broke, I couldn't afford a meal
But now I'm now rich I can't be fake I gots to keep it real
It's been a long time baby since I first got down
But it still keep making these funky sounds
(I earned my respect in the street
The ghetto's been good to me
I'm never going to turn my back
The true and living so I got to kick the facts)"

That's your life
Girl
Smoking that glass pipe
I come from the city of dope
It couldn't be saved by john the pope
'Cause the base head lyric sees the light
Two fat raps to the head last night
Cocaine cocaine, is that your rap
Every day and night it's coming back
C-o-c-a-i-n-e
The rich man's high what it used to be
But things looking different in eighty-five
Cocaine, cocaine is that your high
Since age thirteen what have I seen
A lotto of base heads straight coke fiends
Snorting, puffing, that's the life
But it's all over when you hit that pipe
Big coke dealers on the knock
All smoked up with no more rocks
Base heads buy, coke from him
But he smokes more than all of them
The big coke man, ain't too cool
He smokes more than all you fools
He's gotta a lotta do, but not a lotta bank
A brand new car with an empty tank
Pretty white smoke all in his chest
And a 84 benz, reposessed
Girl, that's your life
Girl smoking that glass pipe
Fresh young tender only fifteen
Walking on a strip just wanna be seen
Never touch coke a day in her life
But now that girl's gotta have her pipe
'Cause she met a man his name was jock
Do it to her a good and he smoked a rock
Put it in her joint all crunched up
And now everyday she takes a puff
Girl, that's your life
Girl smoking that glass pipe
I know you know what coke can do
Come into your life and take over you
Now you kicking back thinking bout your dream
But it never comes true 'cause you're just a coke fiend
You asked your woman what's the prob
She said it's you 'cause you don't do your job
Used to make good love from the start
But now coke had done damage to your private parts
Girl, that's your life
Girl smoking that glass pipe
Your mind is gone your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last three days
Inhale, exhale you don't care
Coke smoke only no fresh air
You can't even talk you don't wanna listen
You and your body on that cocaine mission
Three days straight where's your mind
It's gonna out of town and your brain is fried
Just smoke and choke until you're broke
Just smoke that coke until you croke
And it would be, I can't lie
No great loss if you should die
'Cause your life is wrecked, you girl is checked
She chose on my and I was set
I took her home to make my move
But she wanted to base she was just like you"

You thought it was a fad, you really can't understand rap
How these young playas come up and live fat
Big houses, cars, watch the homies bubble
Do a lot of good but can't stay out of trouble
?? Cause hes the president, he bought a lot of stuff you could never get
Take us to the game you wanna see my bus,
But all the little kids wanna be like us
When they get home, and turn the TV on,
It's Too $hort baby on the microphone
I see a lot of styles when I'm watching videos
Looking at the background talking at the hoes
Then they R and B cats incorporated rap into their program

We dropping platinum, numba one, bitch, that's how its done

Lil homie went to school everyday, knew what he wanted
Wa'nt trying to be a thug wa'nt trying to get blunted
It was all a dream, but there's certain things
You gotta do, like do good in school
His best friend wouldn't listen didn't make good grades
Coach kicked him off the team wouldn't let 'em play
So he stopped going to school and started hangin' with some g's
Drinkin' beer and smoking weed
Two years later one went to college quick he got a basketball scholarship
His homeboy was in the hood one day got arrested
Took him to the pen they say he got molested
Jealous cause his old friend took the right path
Watching ESPN I saw him in the draft
Now he got a V-12 sittin' on dubs, that's how it is when ya what

She used to be a nerd on the honor roll
A four eye conesour, books kinda short on looks
A latch key kid, best friend was her computer
In high school nobody wanted to do her
When she graduated from college she got paid
Got a good job, now she got it made
Gots some contacts, and let her hair down
She gots the legs and the walk that'll make you stare her down
You betta get you're shit together you running out of time
Something on your mind, you need to stop lyin'
You ain't balling like her you can't get into the party
Out in Beverly hills trying flip a Ferrari
Butcha credit ain't cool and you got declined
He said ""You're welcome"" and ""But to come back anytime""
But me, I'm spending cash for this bitch
And that's just the way it is
When you living the good life, good life

Too $hort:
Gotta get me some pussy
Bitch.
What's really goin' on?
Yeah, $hort dog's in the house
Funky fresh, bitch.
I saw you walkin' down the street had to stop
Turned up the radio, dropped the top
Say you look so good, your so fine
I'll take you to my house, we'll spend some time
I know you feel me, you need to find me
And give me head while I'm doin' about 90
Bitch, believe it or not, I'm about to come up.
What's up with the cop?
I'll get you in my car, let you work that tongue
Drivin' to my house, we'll have some fun
But this ain't no Too $hort freaky tale
'Cause right now I'm goin' through a dry spell
Stopped fuckin' with the hoes, just ride and look
Dip to the house to get the porno books
Thinkin' to myself I gotta knock a bitch
I gotta get some pussy, man fuck this shit.
Gotta Get Some Lovin'. [x8]
Bounced to the house all by myself
Can't get no pussy & I'm mad as hell
'Cause magazines can't even do the trick
I guess I have to watch me a porno flick
Popped in the movie, they start fuckin'
He was lickin' she was suckin'
I watched them ol' nasty freaks
Wishin' that shit might happen to me
I got a beep and got juiced up homey
Looked at my pager and it said tone only
I need a bitch that wanna give me some
Loves givin' head just to make me come
Freak nasty all on my dick
Just like the hoe in the porno flick
I went to bed without fuckin' a bitch
I gotta get some pussy man fuck this shit.
Gotta Get Some Lovin'. [x8]
I need a bitch, so I can get me some
She'll lick on These Nuts and then make me come
Get real freaky, had her pussy wet
Ease on in like an oakland vet
Lay your ass down by the fireplace
Stick my dick in your mouth, let you have a taste
Of this skinny muthafucker with a big ol' dick
I'll let you ride it right after you lick it
See I come from the city of dope
>From the mouth to the pussy and back down your throat
I gotta get some, I keep thinkin' of sex
I wonder who'll call my beeper next
I keep callin' hoes, ain't no one home
And like a punk muthafucker I'm all alone
So I told myself, I'm knockin' a bitch
I gotta get some pussy man fuck this shit.
Gotta Get Some Lovin'. [x8]
Where it's at.
Back on the streets and it's on again
Bumped a little freak named sonja san
She jumped in the car and we started to ride
Just graduated from Oakland High
18 years, thick as hell
She look kinda young, but my dick can't tell
Ride through the town with my sunroof open
Thinkin' about the pussy, man, just hopin'
Later on, some hennessay and tangeray
Will have her ass so high, I get to fuck today
I hit a corner and seen her pops
She waved to him, smiled and told her stop
I pulled over, looked at her father
He took one look and said, you can't mess with partner
I had to leave without my young bitch
Can't get no pussy man fuck this shit.
Gotta Get Some Lovin'. [x8]"

I'm so hard on a bitch nigga
I mean it's nothin' though, you know I'm from the town
Everythang on a bitch
That's how we do it
{""I'm hard on a bitch, go ask my first ho""}
I'm not nice to these hoes, most of the time
I say what the fuck, is on my mind
I grab my pen, and write a rhyme
And say somethin' 'bout a bitch on every line
She just gave me 800, a G last night
She could pay me for years and couldn't be my wife
Everybody talkin' 'bout, how these pimps be funny
A bitch couldn't lock me down with Whitney's money
Some niggaz get paid but they're not the boss
Cain't even show off, stop and floss
... Without askin permission
Why you bitch-ass niggaz always askin yo' bitch
If you can do thangs, what'chu wanna do mayne?
You wanna help your girl step up her shoe game?
Take her shoppin', just to get it poppin'
You weak for the pussy and you know you need to stop it
Hard on a bitch, I'm hard on a bitch
I'm hard on a bitch so hard on a bitch
Hard on a bitch, I'm hard on a bitch
I'm hard on a bitch I'm so hard on a beee-itch!
But you ain't though, and you cain't flow
She's a pro, but you ain't know
You so soft, you ain't pimpin' these hoes
You take 'em to the mall and buy expensive clothes
And let her drive your car, so you can say you're fuckin'
She disrespects you and don't pay you nothin'
But that's you - 'cause if it was me
She'll be comin' to the table with a meal to eat
And I stay hungry, I like hoes that make money
You got a pussy, and they want it
So give it to 'em and collect the fee
Buy some mo' shoes and give the rest to me
Cinderella and her glass slipper
They say, a lot of fuckin' makes yo' ass bigger
I say, keep fuckin' make my ass richer
While yo' booty and my pockets get thicker
Hard on a bitch, I'm hard on a bitch
I'm hard on a bitch so hard on a bitch
Hard on a bitch, I'm hard on a bitch
I'm hard on a bitch I'm so hard on a beee-itch!"
88,Hard on the Boulevard,1990,Short Dog's in the House (1990),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Sunshine, convertable tops
You call 'em rags, we call 'em drops
You ride black walls, we ride vogues
You got a girlfriend, we pimp hoes
You say I'm fake, I say you're smoking
I'm just a mack named $hort from oakland
Just like a tag team wrestling tip
With a nasty bitch, then the homie switch
Bitch, ain't getting nothing but a lesson taught
If your pimping ain't strong, it's not my fault
Hoes start choosing, wouldn't give 'em a break
I pull out my old white too $hort tape
I'm playing dope fiend beat and the shit still hits
Trying to stick my dick all in them lips
She said no, I never did it before
Well you ain't the bitch I'm looking for
'Cause she's rich and thick and chocolate
Wouldn't hesitate to lick my dick
All my parters say $hort what's up?
See me with a bitch with a big-ass butt
I don't answer, I start laughing
Nothing going on but the oaktown macking
Laying it right, all damn night
Hoes getting sprung like they smoking the pipe
El dorado, mazeratti
Nothing but freaks with fine bodies
I love to roll my mercedes benz
I'm nothing but a player like all my friends
So when you call me fake, be for real
The call me short dog 'cause I'm hard as hell
Hope your girlfriend's name ain't linelle
I screwed her last night in a cheap motel
Like I told my crew, when the toss up's chill
Humping like a chevy rolling down foothill
Get off the pipe fool, stop cracking
Be like short dog and start macking
T double o s-h-o-r-t
I go solo, can't nobody fuck with me
I'll just kick back counting my bank
No cokes smoking, just potent dank
Funky fresh on the microphone
When you spin that wax, it's not the same ol' song
Round and round it goes, where it stops no one knows
You see me at the clubs catching all the hoes
I don't drink vodka, I do drink gin
I like to get a blowjob from your girlfriend
'Cause I'm macking, baby, you know that's right
I'm from the oaktown, straight eastside
I got all my game from east oakland streets
Now motherfuck you damn shit-haired freaks
I go on and on as I sing my song
If you're tender and young, I fuck you all night long
I'm not a no-good punk, I didn't make you flunk
I didn't tell the whole world your pussy stunk
I cut you slack in my rap, I could've macked your mother
But life is too $hort so I kept it undercover
I'm so damn hard, on the boulevard
Hoes ain't tripping on me, they wanna fuck my car
Freak nasty don't trip, to me it ain't shit
You can suck my dick with some fat hoe lips
Riding in a caddy with the top let down
California sunshine, cruising the town
On the boulevard, maybe drop my top
If you're feeling hot, don't even stop
Cause it feels so good, I'm oh so sprung
They way you work that tongue, it just makes me cum
I told all my homies, all about
The way I bust big nuts, in your mouth
On the boulevard, we're riding oh so real
Not skyline, I'm talking about foothill
And when it ended, you know what happened
I'm so hard I just can't stop macking
I know I gotta stop sooner, but I'll stop later
They call me short dog, I'm nothing but a player
I know what she's thinking, I'm falling in love
But there's another freak I'm thinking of
She's got long long hair, she's not like you though
She'll do whatever I say, she'll even be my hoe
'Cause I don't wanna get married, I'd rather freak mary
Make good love and I do mean very
Wherever I go, it's the same old case
Same damn thing all over the place
(Nothing but bitches) tight-ass jeans to pose in
I used to ride the strip trying to catch the hoes
They wasn't choosing, nope not these hoes
They wanted big time vettes, riding brand new vouges
So like I said before, I ain't tripping
Told myself it's time to stop bullshitting
Did the gangster walk, did it like this
Walked up to a girl and I called her a bitch
I said my name is $hort, I don't play games
I only play young bitches, now what's your name?
She said I wouldn't tell you in all my life
You're just a little thug, you're not my type
I said I'm sir too $hort, couldn't be no punk
East oaktown is where I'm from
You see wherever I go, it's the same old case
Same damn thing all over the place
(Nothing but bitches) mad 'cause I told the truth
I'm calling you one and you can call me, too
Call me too $hort, call me too thin
But you wouldn't get a dime out of this pimp
So just give it up baby and I'll run right through ya
Maybe just maybe I'll come back to ya
Like too clean, I'm riding cadillac
I hit the strip, turn around, and come right back
See I'm a big mack, and every bitch in sight
Says is that short dog sitting at a red light?"
89,Here We Go,1999,Can't Stay Away (1999),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"We talk shit, 'cause we are the shit
Never looked back since we started it
When y'all want heat we provide it, ride it
Till the wheels fall of, shaking 'em all off
Six figure niggas with it, over did it, spit it
In ways that'll cause a rush
Keeping your face in a state of disgust
Hating but still trying to be like us
Twist the lime on the corona, grab my crime diploma
Then head to the block, to pull up five in the mona
Shit, I need to chrome up, become a home owner
Look lifes a bitch, but I'm on her
I almost cracked this, no more hustling backwards
Up the ave I zip, nigga trying to have shit
I'm your average, ghetto nigga turned maverick
You'd never, said to a nigga ""Whateve for the cash, I'm with""
I don't have step, I leave it in you're averix
Then shoot it it the air, whateva I have left
Outlaw, simply I out draw y'all
Wether clubs or the street, I out ball y'all
Niggas ain't ready, I doubt all y'all
Fly ass niggas I reroute all y'all
If it ain't for the paper I don't show my face up
Make a bet I turn the ace up, $hort and Jay, what
I never stop making money don't give 'em no slack
Drinking dirty motherfuckers till a hoe come back
With my scratch, bitch I was born to mack
To uphold the pimping, I was sworn to that
I hear a lot of shit talking when I listen to rap
Only a few MC's get to hang that plaque
On the wall rappers ball, but they don't live phat
Nigga, I doubt if you go gold or platinum
What we do has only been mastered by a few
I take a half a million tapes sell 'em straight to you
All that shit niggas talking just can't be real
I don't need a record deal, I need eighteen wheels
I roll right up in the hood I got tapes for sell
Bitches running in their house they can't wait to tell
Somebody, she got a new Too $hort tape
And hes spitting pimp game with his homeboy Jay
We talk shit, 'cause we are the shit
Never looked back since we started it
When y'all want heat we provide it, ride it
Till the wheels fall of, shaking 'em all off
Six figure niggas with it, over did it, spit it
In ways that'll cause a rush
Keeping your face in a state of disgust
Hating but still trying to be like us
Now here they come again the gold diggas trying to get paid,
Wanna trick the old rich niggas, trying to get laid
She'll suck his dick, as soon as she meet him
Don't have to sell a body for me I don't need her
To turn tricks for me, how much you cost bitch?
I'm all about large bank deposits
On and off the mic I always set trends
Either you see with bitches, or I'm rolling with pimps
Brook-laan to Oakland, I keep smokin'
Jay-Z and short dog at these hoes again
The kinda niggas that'll take a square bitch around the corner
Put this pimp game on her
I don't fuck with broke hoes and I don't trick
But I'll still rub my big ass dick on her clit
Get her hooked, wanna be mine I need some money
If she ain't kicking in all the time she don't want me
Hoes, flows, money, cars
Y'all wannabe stars can't fuck with none of these bars
This is real nigga rap, we can spit it through the mic
And you can feel niggas scratch, and sell a mil if that
So real when we drop this shit its in trouble
When I guess the pair you gotta ship it double
In the independent phenom, y'all miniature dons
Wannabe jigga, pops styles and hennessy richa'
When I die, leave my canopy richa'
I put it down hard ever since I entered the pit'cha
Can fuck with me for records to the recreational cent'a
I got it wrapped y'all from the grammys to the back park
Short dog y'all, what you thought y'all, Oakland, Bk, New york y'all
Be the voice for the streets we supply for years
And go platinum on our most quiet years
We talk shit, 'cause we are the shit
Never looked back since we started it
When y'all want heat we provide it, ride it
Till the wheels fall of, shaking 'em all off
Six figure niggas with it, over did it, spit it
In ways that'll cause a rush
Keeping your face in a state of disgust
Hating but still trying to be like us
Chorus repeat 2x"

Nasty bee-yacht (let's go niggaz don't know what to deal a hoe)
You just a tramp hoe

No I don't like calamari and no I don't eat caviar

So, won't you come on in, shorty you can bring your friend
Just let me finish off my double shot shot of Henn
We can leave now the sport begins, on you

It's time to fuck baby, jump in the truck baby
'Cause I been wantin' to tear yo fine ass up lately
You like your dicks big, you like the way they taste
Don't shoot it let me take it out and cum on your face
I won't waste your time if you don't waste mine
Let's keep it funky and live, just like the bassline
My girl will lick your clit, the bitch is on this shit
Close your eyes you'll swear you're fuckin' in a porno flick
The way you want my dick, you got my thing hard
You got skills, you should win an ABN award
I got my playing card, it's the two of spades
Deuce is wild, check it out, and you was laid
Now we moanin' and groanin' screamin' and hollin'
All them super top notches, yeah, you'll see who they followin'
Big Dog will make you open your eyes wider

You're such a nasty girl, take them panties off
The way you do it is impossible, I can't get soft
You up your fuckin' like your pussy got a motor
Missionary, on top, from the back, roll you over
You just hupmin' and I keep pumpin'
Then I ride around my body cause my beat's bumpin'
Yeah I know you know, I'm a pimp hoe
And I heard all about you, little nymfo
Pussy like Niagara Falls, they say you love it all
So when I nut, suck my dick, bitch, and rub my balls
'Cause I'm nasty too you'd better ask it's true
It's a one time shot, I'm just passin' through
Don't be shy, don't be stingy, don't be holdin' back
And don't get hooked on the dick, like you're smokin' crack
Just keep doin' what you doin', don't change a thing
And you'll see how much love this pimp game can bring
(Cutty Cartel)
No I don't like calamari and no I don't eat caviar
But you might catch me exquisit at the bar

Just let me finish off my double shot shot of Henn
We can leave now the sport begins, on you
(Devin the Dude)
Ain't no sense in frontin' let's go, move something
You know I want some of that pussy girl, why you frontin'?
You can rub on my nuts, while your friends ain't watchin'
If you expect a check for some sex, it ain't happenin'
I'm the vagina finder, the cunt collecting king
I'm 'bout to get a platinum penis ring
Your second guess is bitches, and yes or no
You're down with shit, just move around let's go
Damn... you still here, ain't nobody lookin' for ya?
Do you have a home or an apartment or ya
Kinda stay here with the crew, knowin' the shit that we do
We just frant through, a couple of bitches just like you
Where ya girlfriends? Where ya car at? What's the damn deal?
Girl you got to leave here for real
I hope you wasn't plannin' to get your stack on
Get up bitch put your panties back on
It's over

No I don't like calamari and no I don't eat caviar

91,Hobo Hoeing,2003,Married to the Game (2003),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Daaaamn!
Can't believe these hoes out here givin' away the pussy for the low-low
Shit! Bitches fuckin' everythang, everybody, everyday
Damn girl! Better get you some management
All this time you been trickin for the low-low?
You coulda been gettin' rich, you just don't know
Girl you worked all night for that chump change?
Let them ballers write you off as a fun thang?
Take my hand - I got a quick plan
I know you dream about marryin a rich man
See his wife in the Benz with the cute babies?
The hype'll make your friends and you crazy
Cause you know about his two ladies
But he ain't fuckin' wit'chu baby
Come holla at your Uncle $hort
I'll have you playin' these niggaz like a sport (HA HA!)
All this time you play around, you love to love me lay you down
If you'd like to suck a dick, I bet you'd like to fuck a trick
All you ladies in the place, I'd love to let you have a taste
I'll put my dick up in yo' face - why you hobo hoe?
My name is Too $hort, I'm known for pimpin' women
And last night, I did it again
New money, new bitches
Why they actin' crazy, who is it?
I never heard of Too $hort - then you must be a square
Fuck around and get slapped when you fucks with a player
Real women get much respect
Golddiggers and groupies, don't fuck with it
I'd rather get a real hoe
Put the bitch to work and get some real dough
I don't wanna spend a night for cash
What'chu been doin' all day wit your triflin ass? (Bitch!)
All this time you play around, you love to love me lay you down
If you'd like to suck a dick, I bet you'd like to fuck a trick
All you ladies in the place, I'd love to let you have a taste
I'll put my dick up in yo' face - why you hobo hoe?
I made too many songs, to name the tracks
Not enough walls, to hang the plaques
Say hater, what you aimin at?
You ain't no G, you can't be claimin that
Your girl said she had to find a trick
'Cause she don't like you, OR your tiny dick
I don't really care, what she's sayin'
As long as this song, is what she's playin'
I know she better slow that roll
I ain't said a word and yo' hoe just chose
You know I gotta take her from you
And after today, you couldn't make her want you (HA HA HA)
All this time you play around, you love to love me lay you down
If you'd like to suck a dick, I bet you'd like to fuck a trick
All you ladies in the place, I'd love to let you have a taste
I'll put my dick up in yo' face - why you hobo hoe?
I just don't know what bitches see, why all these hoes want chicken feed
Ain't none of these hoes worth 50 cents, so break these ladies all you pimps
Never have this much fun anywhere, to go back home I just don't care
Me leave this game no I don't dare - why you hobo hoe?
You fuckin' with me, I'm fuckin' wit'chu
You fuckin' with me, I'm fuckin' wit'chu
You fuckin' with me, I'm fuckin' wit'chu
You fuckin' with me, bitch I'm fuckin' wit'chu
You fuckin' with me, I'm fuckin' wit'chu
You fuckin' with me, you know I'm fuckin' wit'chu
You fuckin' with me, I'm fuckin' wit'chu
You fuckin' with me, bitch I'm fuckin' wit'chu too
Fo' sho'!"
92,Hoes,1992,Shorty the Pimp  (1992),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"You see some people like to play the dating game
Meet a new freak and ask what's your name?
Wine and dine and waste all that time
Spending money on a hoe cause you think she's fine
Holding hands at the movies, waiting much to fuck
Played like a sucker, you should know what's up
Getting dogged by a snotty, fake, broke-ass hoe
Listen to a real dog, 'cause I know
You get a pretty yellow bitch with that long-ass hair
Fine motherfucker trying to get with a player
Can't fuck worth shit, old stiff-ass bitch
Tried to get some head and she just kissed my dick
I need a bitch with a beeper, a full time tramp
She can't suck dick like she's licking a stamp
But she can lick it all around, or swallow it whole
Deep throat this big dick and act real bold
You go to sleep, she'll straight rob your ass
Cause hoes like to steal and take all your cash
And when hoes go to jail, pimps make bail
Take 'em to the stroll and let the pussy sell
Cause to a trick, they're just quick nuts
But to a grandmother, they're like big sluts
And if you're short dog, they look like bank rolls
If I ever go broke I'll just break hoes
Cause hoes were made to be broken
It happens every day in oakland
I need a bitch, that's one thing I know
Put my money where my mouth is and just break that hoe
Two and fro, they like to run in pairs
Hit small towns and sell pussy everywhere
I ain't giving no bitches, no kind of slack
Cause oakland California is where they made the mack
Prostitution is the oldest profession
Kick back young partner, learn your lesson
Pimp till you die, as long as you know
Pimps ain't nothing but hoes
Getting paid, for everything you say
If a hoe wants to fuck you, she gots to pay
Keep the bitch broke and control the world
'Cause when hoes get rich, they call 'em call girls
Now ain't nothing like a neighborhood trampy slut
Take a hoe to a spot and let her lick these nuts
Get a square bitch, you gotta lie to kick it
But with a nasty bitch, she'll just lick it and lick it
I had a square bitch, man, she looked way too cool
She said she loved me, but is that true?
She asked me could she be my lady
Wanted so much to have my baby
So what bitch? I popped your cherry
Hell fucking no, I don't wanna get married
Cause can't no bitch hound me
Talking that shit about a family
I wants no champagne, I drink gin and juice
Bring a bag of ice and watch a ho get loose
Spread the word, we're getting tossed tonight
And please don't trip on the cellulite
I got a fat bitch, sucking on my dick
Every day homie it's the same old shit
Don't look stupid, hoe, drop them goddamn drawers
Get your ass in the bed and let's fuck like dogs
On the very first night, we fucked
I got the pussy, I got sucked
I couldn't wait, she asked me why
I let the answer shoot straight in her eye, bitch
Hoes are like cum freaks, they suck you dry
The do what you say, and don't ask why
Who said that hoe ain't old enough?
If she could bleed, then she can fuck
Call me dirty dog but your cock stank
Motherfuckers think pimps ain't making bank
But the, pimp game just don't stop
You gotta be down to reach the top
I tell all my homies play these hoes
Don't eat the pussy and play these hoes
Cause some of these hoes get tore up smoking
Bitches like that you find all through oakland
Miniskirts and no panties on
When it's time to fuck, it don't take too long
And it's mandatory for hoes to simp
Catch other hoes and bring 'em to pimps
So take this game and keep it for life
Never make a hoe into a housewife
Just get a good bitch, a workaholic like holly
Bitch so bold, she'll take a piss in the alley
And make big bank, it's the pussy is dope
They keep coming back until the tricks go broke
But if that hoe jumps off the track
Another young bitch will bring them tricks right back"
93,Hoochie,1992,Shorty the Pimp  (1992),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Yeah, you know, it's like, ehm - I rap
I got two platinum albums
I do a lotta concerts all over the place
I seen the groupies
They do whatever you say
When you want it, how you want it, and where you want it
But I ain't trippin'
Cause these are the '90s
So when a freak say to me she loves me
I just say somethin' like this
I say baby, why you wanna do all that?
Sleep with a brother just because I rap
You keep lookin' in my eyes, and you just won't stop
All damn night you been on my jock
But I'm no fool
'Cause you're sprung on my house and my swimming pool
Call me a dog, I got several freaks
When I do my shows I can't get no sleep
Cause you keep knockin' at my hotel door
I was there to sleep, and can't get no more
Sleep, so why you wanna wake me up?
When I told you once I don't wanna fuck
So get on, girl, won't you mind your own
I'm tryin' to sleep, so just leave me alone
Next time I see you, I do my duty
But tonight, I got another hoochie
(Chorus: d'wayne wiggins)
Hoochie, tryin' to be bourgie
But you're nothin' but a groupie
Riding on my snoopy
I'm short dog, I wanna take you backstage
And you can read it like it's on the front page
You wanna do somebody right
For those who ain't famous - not tonight
You do the nba and the nfl
Rappers and singers as well
Keyboard players and the drummer
It's like track and field with just runners
So let me get on the phone and call all my friends
Ain't a damn thing changed but the paint on our benz
Get somethin' that you can't get from good girls
Care less about a weave or a jherri curl
'Cause I know something you don't know
Ain't nothin' like these groupie hoes
And since tony toni ton? made the track
Get lost, fool, and tell your girl I'm back
Sing it
Get off my lap, 'cause you're gettin' kinda heavy
Lookin' at the bed, askin am I ready
Ready for what, sex?
Well, after that, baby, what's next?
We get a house in the suburbs, two-car garage
And every night I get a good massage?
Save that drama for later
And take this number to my skypager
Keep in touch, but don't call too much
When I come back around, you know what's up
It's time to get busy once again
Bring a few partners, 'cause I got friends
It's goin' down like always
Young groupies in the hallways
I got the money, the fame, and all the things you like
So I see you next time when I rock the mic
You"
94,How Does It Feel,1999,Can't Stay Away (1999),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Chorus: D' Wayne Wiggins
How does it feel when ya livin' like that, and ya pockets are fat?
'Cause you're a playa, and you're pimpin' hoes
So tell me how does it feel when ya money ain't right,
And ya pockets are tight?
You're still a hustla, and you can't let go
When I was broke, I used to feel the pain
Now I got money, ain't nothin' changed
Same hustla, tryin' to hold on to what I got
And that's alot, players like me can't be stopped
I was starvin, couldn't afford a TV Dinner
But now I roll around in a DB-7
Throwin' up the two, to the hoes and pimps
It's all about the money, you know what I'm gettin'
How the fuck you think I felt when I was broke
All the rumors I got killed and I was smoked
I tell the truth, I don't care how you feel about me
I'm still in the game and you still gotta see
My face goin' down the muthafuckin street
Top down, beat loud with a top-notch freak
You say it ain't real life
'Cause you don't know what it feels like, beyotch
I feel like I'm a million dollar bill
Still in the game, all about the real
Can't feel sorry for you, do your thang
Don't be mad at the world 'cause you can't hang
If you feel like doin' somethin' that ain't productive
Look in the mirror, check yourself and say ""fuck it""
It's the year two-thousand, I know you feel me
But I can't understand why you niggas wanna kill me
Went from broke to rich, I got your bitch kneelin
I told her ""smoke this dick bitch, don't fight the feelin""
And when she did it, she started jockin me
I saw it in your eyes, you felt like sockin me
For every action there's a consequence
Playa-haters always tryna start some shit
But then you gotta fight these niggas here
It feels good to be a playa, bitches everywhere
I feel like eleven albums ain't enough
And at the same time you feel like you can't come up
Sometimes real life don't feel right
You been fuckin' her for years but its still tight
Then I came through bammin, vagina started expandin
Used to be shallow, but now you landed in
Deep water drownin and that's some real game
It's been your pussy for years, but it don't feel the same
I been creepin', feelin' your bitch up on the weekend
Is it still good she calls me Dr. Feelgood
I'll be her last pimp, you just a has been
And when she talks about you it's all past tense
I said I don't give a fuck about history
I'll tell you bout my life then show you how this dick'll be
In you all night, go ask your bitch was she feelin' me
Man, you niggas be killin' me, haters"
95,I Ain't Nothin' But a Dog,1992,Shorty the Pimp  (1992),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"I've been a dog ever since I was young
I saw The Mack and got all so sprung
I couldn't help it, I had to be just like that
With a stable of hoes and my pockets fat
But don't trip, I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage and a wedding ring
I be a player for life, forget about a wife
She just ain't my type
'Cause I mack each hoe and get richer
And if it ain't like that then I forget ya
I know you're just a freak, hoe
You're so nasty
That's why you're stairin'
When you walk like pass me
Bitch, now you're lookin' back
All dogs must chase the cat
So here I come, I just wanna fuck you and cut
Treat you like trampy slut
So much game when homies' tough
Meet a bitch like you and smooth come up
I have your fake-ass closin' up bank accounts
Spittin' straight pimpgame from the Oakland-town
It's been done before and I do it again
Break your mama, your sista and all your friends
$Hort dog's on the microphone
And I won't stop mackin' till my bank is long
So try to break me if you wanna
From me you get nothin' but drama
If you're a rich bitch, I got a new twist
And if you're with it, bitch
Then we can do this
Put me on the payroll
Bick me down bankroll
Buy me a benz and keep my tank full
Cause other than that, I don't need no brood
$Hort Dog ain't nothin' but a dog...
I got all my game from East Oakland's street
So mothafuck you damn shit-head freaks
Couldn't pay me enough to treat you right
Cause $hort Dog ain't nothin' nice
Like a sucka-mothafucka let a bitch be boss
Tellin' him how much she wants
Let her use your car
I'm from oakland, bitch
And you can check my rap
I hear fake bitches get slapped
Let a bitch get bold with me
I start to act like Goldy
Tell me who's in the house now?
Shorty The Pimp
And I'm the last mothafucka
That will pay your rent
I ain't blind, I know you're fine as fuck
But you're a tramp, bitch
You ain't mine what's up?
Try to give me some pussy but I want some head
And I already know everythin' you did
They say you fuck like old-ass tired bitch
But the word is out you suck some good ass dick
And I don't want nothin' if I can't get it all
You should know
'Cause I ain't nothin' but a dog, bitch...
$Hort dog ain't nothin' but a dog
Bitch, fuck with me and you gotta do it all
Most brothas try to take freaks out
I get a room and stick my dick in her mouth
They spend money on a movie and some dinner
But $hort Dog goes straight up in her
I give bitches no respect
And the way I run my game they understand this shit
You couldn't be like me cause you buy her things
Used to be a broke fiend and now it's diamond rings
I remember when I fucked your prom date
You bought a dress and everythin'
But she just couldn't wait for the pralm to end
So she can call me up it was our very first date
And it was cool to fuck
Now I be doin' this shit all the time
I got bitches on my mind
Can't change in 1992
'Cause I still gotta find new, sweet, black
What should I call it? I won't say it
But if it's lain' on my bed, I'm a fade it
$Hort dog ain't nothin' but a dog
Use to clown to hoes at the East Maid mall
I was actin' like a pimp when I was 7
Started to suckin' up game at 11
And at the age of young 14
I started to knock young bitches on the scene
Couldn't give a fuck less about a bitch
Thinkin' like that $hort Dog got rich
Now I'm makin' ends and you think I'm weak
'Cause I'm allways downin' these toe-up freaks
Tell me who's the man
And who's the mouse, bitch?
I'm Audi-five to my dog house..."
96,I Ain't Trippin',1988,Life Is... Too $hort (1988),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"I was told not long ago
Too $hort don't stop that rap!'
Now every time I grab the mic
I rock you just like that
8 years ago when I started to rap
I use to sell tapes everywhere
It was me and my homeboy freddy b, yoo
Kickin' it like big players
Everybody loved my raps like 100 dollar bills
I rocked house parties on 98th
Even rocked in 69 vill
Might find me on the mic at Hot Lips house
Or at the Eastbay Dragonspot
All the 85th boys with their hand in the air
Screamin' Too $hort just don't stop!'
Like Royal Park, like Plymouth Rock
First street and Sunnyside
Like Sobrante Park and Brookefield
East Oakland, yeah, that's right
5 years ago I continued to rock
And if you haven't yet heard my name
It was all in the papers, on the evening news
I was stone cold in the game
Around that time a friend of mine
My homeboy Lionel B hooked me up like this, yoo
On the stage just rockin' the beat
Some say I have a dirty mind
Sometimes that might be true
But these are just some dirty times
I ain't trippin' on you...
I ain't trippin', keep on talkin'
You think I'm smokin' that pipe
I got money, homeboy
I even got some of your future wifes
Well, my story goes like this, man
I smooth went out on wax
Singin' Girl, That's Your Life'
Female Funk' and Shortrapp'
Silky D worked the beat kicked me cold cash
I was ridin' the bus one day
Next day I was on the gas
Everybody loved Too $hort
Rollin' down the strip
Then one day just like that
Homeboy jumped on my tip
You started spreadin' rumors, man
Said you saw me rappin' in jail
No, I never came down to the flatlands
I was chillin' with the homies from the hill
I ain't trippin' but the word went out
Sir Too $hort was through
Can't really say where it all began
So I'ma blamin' it all on you
Everybody use to say
Too $hort don't stop that rap!'
Now every time you see my face
You say I'm smokin' crack
Oakland, California, I heard it all before
I'm makin' big bank now, rockin' the crowd
I ain't trippin' no more...
Now I'm back on top again
I still don't stop that rap
Everytime I grab the mic
My bankroll's gettin' fat
Freaky Tales' took care of that
You know I'm comin' up
Cause every time you see my face
I'm rollin' all so tough
When I made the cut... the-he-he Freaky Tales'
I started picturin' this
I named my album Born To Mack'
With the cleanest raps and beats
Everythin' was kickin' in
Me and Ran kept cashin' checks
Next thing I know there you go
Guess who's on my tip?
You said I just got out of jail
Jumped right back on that pipe
Your sister's boyfriend told you, man
I'm smokin' every night
Then you came to my show
And stood there so damn bold
You said Too $hort, man, you smoking'
And I'm standin' here dreamin' gold
I ain't trippin' no more
Really ain't worth my time
So to squashed it off I kicked on back
And wrote you all the rhyme
Benzes rollin', Beemers jettin'
And Caddies keep on dippin'
You keep on talkin' all that crap
I ain't trippin'..."
97,I Like It,2007,Get Off The Stage (2007),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"(Too $hort)
I hope you wanna do the same thing I wanna do
Do you want me the same way I want you?
I like you so much baby but I won't touch
Until you say it's time to leave here and go fuck
You do it so right I could never say it's wrong
I like the way you act when they play your favorite song
You scream out loud, start dancin' hella wild
Girl right now I wanna pull your panties down
Fuck you real good down low on the flo'
Fuck you on the stage like we puttin' on a show
Fuck you in the stall in the men's bathroom
Outside in the car, we can do that too
I'll drive you to the house, dick sucked gettin' head
Play with your pussy then fuck you in the bed
After all that fuckin' I'ma fall asleep in it
Wake up in the mornin' and fuck you in the kitchen
Girl I like it when you do it like that
I like the way you shake and you bounce that back
I like the way it looks 'cause your booty so fat
I'd like to take you home girl and move in that crack
I like it when them cheeks jump up and down
I like it when you drop and make it touch the ground
You lookin' in my eyes and I'm lookin' right back
Just don't stop dancin 'cause I like it like that
(Too $hort)
I know you with your man, other niggaz gon' stare
I don't really care, I'm a motherfuckin' player
I never tell you stop, I wanna see you keep goin'
Got a dance so cold, I swear it be snowin'
Even though it's hella hot in here, everybody sweatin' you
Half wanna dance, other half wanna get with you
Every time a nigga walk by and say hello
Starin' at your booty 'cause it moves like jello
Now I'm really feelin' like you need my service
Jealous boyfriend, I can see him gettin' nervous
You don't even notice 'cause you doin' your thang
Shouldn't have came here with him, you knew he couldn't hang
I love the view, but that just ain't enough
I can hear it beepin' like you backin' up a truck
You need a special permit to operate that ass
I'ma hit it right girl and make it last
'Cause I like it when you do it like that
I like the way you shake and you bounce that back
I like the way it looks 'cause your booty so fat
I'd like to take you home girl and move in that crack
I like it when them cheeks jump up and down
I like it when you drop and make it touch the ground
You lookin' in my eyes and I'm lookin' right back
Just don't stop dancin 'cause I like it like that
(Dolla Will)
It's on once again, come and roll with a pimp
I ain't mad at ya girl, get your money, go and strip
Extra shots of Patr-n just in case you wanna sip
Smokin' grapes, pay security so they won't trip
The way you're dancin', how ya move your body so swift
Ass big enough to hold a glass with no coaster
Seen a little bit of cash now you're movin' closer
If you wanna we can leave from here and go somewhere
(That's right) It ain't nothin' 'cause I'm into that
I'm tryin' to see if me, you and your girlfriend can interact
Treat 'em like drinks, if they ain't right then I send 'em back
Gotta be jazzy, can't have the shoes without the bag (Dolla)

I wanna send a special shoutout
To all the females with the matchin' bags, purses, shoes
All the accessories... I like that shit
Girl I like it when you do it like that
I like the way you shake and you bounce that back
I like the way it looks 'cause your booty so fat
I'd like to take you home girl and move in that crack
I like it when them cheeks jump up and down
I like it when you drop and make it touch the ground
You lookin' in my eyes and I'm lookin' right back
Just don't stop dancin 'cause I like it like that"

With a little bit of Alize (Alize... Alize..)

Get the pussy like I'm married
And send her home with the cock swoll, did her pops know?
Little girl that he tryna protect was in the crib doin' porno

Fo' sho' baby, I know these hoes
Step up too 'em and show these hoes
I never wonder to myself ""Would she?""
I get deep in her mind and her pussy

Who dat? She was the world's greatest, dick sucker
Play the note with the tongue while, finger fuck her

Got my dick in her ass, front of one of her friends

Face down, ass up -- bitch be still whikle I bust this nut

Remember one thing, I got a major bitch

Slapped the bitch, she hollered ""No, no daddy!""

I once knew a bitch named Erica
Way back in the day, she had a geri curl
I made her suck my dick on the ferris wheel
Been pimpin' all my life, big player for real

I couldn't stop thinkin' bout how I should be knockin' you
All I wanna do is holla at you later,
Handle my business, you know I'm a player
I've never been a hater, I shouldn't be faultin you,
But you got me laughin' at the nigga you talkin' to

Like Tupac says you need a thug in your life
A nigga like me, I'll beat that pussy up,
Have you at the house doin' all kinda freaky stuff
Ain't nuttin new to me, watcha wanna do to me,
I know you ain't no groupie, givin' up the coochie
But I got deep in your drawls anyway,
I'll get it again, if I want it any day

I like the way your titties shake when your ridin' me,
You take it out lick it and say put it back inside of me
And that's what I'ma do bitch, give you this true dick,
Bring all your girlfriends, and we can do this

Let a nigga know that the pussy's all mine
Hit it on the regular, you know I'm good for that,
Top notch bitches, even fuck them hood rats
Take her to the mansion, take off the pants then,
Kidnap the pussy and hold it for ransom
But none of them bitches can fuck like you,
Hit me on my beeper you know I'm comin' through
Just like that, always was and always will be,
I'll get ya wet, and then you gonna feel me
Way up in ya, not far from Virginia,
Stick it in your mouth on the way down south
So when you get home and smell the cum on your breath,
Go in the bathroom and play with yourself
Your pussy's the best, I must confess,
Whenever your horny I got a ""S"" on my chest
Girl I must confess, your love is the best,
Cause all we wanna do is put this dick in you

How it get so damn hard again, I'm nasty
But I'm not a freak
I just say a lot of rhymes to a lot of beats
It comes easily, I'm a pimp in these streets
I'ma keep makin' money in this industry
So when she bends her knees, I'll be standin up
Gettin' head for 30 minutes, bitch can I fuck?
I know I came in your mouth I can't trust you slut
That's why I'm 'bout to raise up, when I bust a nut
Wipe your face with a napkin from KFC

I don't need you BITCH you need a lot of things
All I need is mo' money, and some choosin' hoes
What I look like buyin bitches new shoes and clothes
Everythang on a bitch that's how it used to go
Back when them old school niggaz rode trues and vogues
I'll be talkin' this pimp shit daily
Bitch you can't play me, what'chu do for me lately?
I know what it is, don't wanna hear about sex
It's two different things with a player and a trick

I just wanna spend yo' dough (spend yo' dough)
Give a pimp what I need (what I need)
'Kay, while I puff my weed (while I puff my weed)
Buy you all the stuff I see (all that stuff I see)
You wanna get fucked by me... by me...
I know you think I'm crazy, based on how retarded I get
All these pimps on the mic, bitch I started that shit
When Snoop was in elementary, I rapped on hella pimp beats
Keep the rhymes in a big-ass box, that's never empty
In 1981 I said, ""Bitch suck my dick!""
And Freddie B, had the tooth fairy turnin' tricks
Befo' Eazy-E, Ice Cube, N.W.A.
I was spittin' pimp rhymes, way up in the bay
I grew up in L.A., back in the day mayne
I moved to Oakland, and soaked up that bay game
Mo' bounce to the ounce, we was bumpin Spoonie Gee
Or Grandmaster Flash, Sugarhill to me
In 1982 we had fun in the streets
All they played was Too $hort, and Run-D.M.C. nigga
And I was rappin' X-rated back then
I was just a lil' kid, but a real mack pimp
Now all these niggaz, pimpin', without no hoes
All these niggaz, rappin' and can't rock no shows
And the rest of y'all frontin, in your videos
Gettin' it, actin' like some silly hoes
You ain't pimpin' mayne! You don't talk like we talk
You like a wannabe gangbanger tryin' to C-walk
You ain't a crip motherfucker, and you ain't a B-dawg
You actin' way too phony, and now you pissin me off
Fake gangster who you killed? Fake pimp what you sayin'?
Yo' album sound fake, and you're fuckin' up the game
You make a lot of rap fans, hate this shit
$Hort Dawg got a new one? I can't wait to get it
It's called ""Up All Night,"" with Lil Jon and Jazze Pha
And if you ain't heard yet, you know I have to say that
Bitches jammin, I know you want it now
$Hort Dawg got the hottest shit comin' out
You know I have to say that

If you want it, then it's yours
Straight to the top with pimpin' $hort
'Cause I'm so cold when I'm on these whores
If I kick her in the ass then it's gon' be sore
But if she listens, we get paid
I get the money, and she gets laid
Punk bitches talkin' 'bout ain't no way
But we look good bitch, every day
And you keep talkin' 'bout life is hard
Never had money or a fly ass car
On the low, she's a three-oh-fo'
Waitin on tables but she should be a hoe
Cause every night she fucks big ballers for free
If she tryin' to come up, she should be callin me
Make some money, dip to the mall with me
And buy some new shit so they all can see
You can have that, if you want that
If you want that, you can have that
You can have that, if you want that
If you want that, you can have that

You gotta make, that, cash, that's it
Anything you want you can have that shit - bitch!
It's no fun when you're broke and lonely
You cain't even smoke no weed
You cain't go out to eat
You havin' dinner at the house - without me
I cain't kick it like that
Where the steak and the chicken at?
Ain't nuttin worse than a broke-ass bitch
You ain't nuttin but a joke, that's it
If you wanna be bigger, and have more
You've gotta choose on a nigga like $hort
You gotta get out that car, and jump in mine
He said ""I don't do no pimpin"" that punk is lyin'!
I'ma send you to the front of the line
If you gimme somethin' cool and you wanna be mine
Square bitches write checks and charge it
But I only take cash and all you get is hard dick
Get your money

Still smokin' that good shit"

She's sexier and looks way better than mine

And if you don't let her go, I'll take her from you
Watchin' that a*** made me lose my breath
She can leave with me, go cruise in my whip
Take her clothes off and do her like hell
If I don't take your girl, who would I get?
And it looked like crack
I said, ?Here, brush your teeth with this?
And now she's soakin' wet, what's next?
Me and your girl havin' sex
I told her she could get it
She told me she was wit it
She know I want to hit it
Come back braggin', tell the homies I did it
I wish I could
Bang in the *** like it's my hood
I'm strapped for the drive-by
Turn her out with this 'Up All Night' life
I want your girl, she's so damn fine
She's sexier and looks way better than mine
I want your girl, she wants me too
And if you don't let her go, I'll take her from you
The grind is a terrible thang to waste
Try not to catch me a case
Quarters, dimes, nickels and eighths
Parked in my lark at 3 A.M. in the dark
Gettin' my *** but here come the NARC
Ooh, tellin' me to depart
Went to school with the ***, used to be a mark
See me on the moon, skippin' and skatin'
Burnin' Pirelli meat, gassin' and brakin'
Strikin' through the trap with my beanie cap
With a throwaway 9 and some D in the back
E'ryday livin', livin' life as a savage
Fistfights and gun battles
'Cause it come with the package
Well above average, mack game impeccable
Don't blame me if ya broad wanna get sexual
She got her legs on a player shoulder
Back bent like she doin' yoga
She's so damn fine
She's sexier and looks way better than mine
I want your girl, she wants me too
And if you don't let her go, I'll take her from you
Dolla, she ain't never seen a hustler like this
15 karats on the right wrist
And ain't no tellin' what's on the other hand
I'm like T.I., I keep a 'Rubberband'
I'm eatin', them n*** is fastin'
I f*** off a rack on a pair of Fendi glasses
It ain't nuttin' 'cause I'm Dolla Will
I keep a *** lookin' like she from Brazil
Some n*** try but it's in me
If that's the kush she slip, then I'ma knock Jimmy
I'm in the club, found one that's friendly
She say she with her man but tryin' to come with me
I want your girl, she's so damn fine
She's sexier and looks way better than mine
I want your girl, she wants me too
And if you don't let her go, I'll take her from you
Beep beep, it's me
The yellow bus rider, Mr. F.A.B.
I'm the dumbest of dummies that do it but with P's
Let me borrow your broad, let me borrow your b***
Give it here, pimpin', I'll give her back
Leave her used, bruised, confused front to the back
'Beat It' like Mike Jack, I bet you won't like that
She lead them right back, man, where your wife at?
Uh, I like the way that she lookin'
And I don't care if she stolen, wifed or tooken
I ain't trippin', I'ma take her down
Got the game from Mom and Dad and Gangsta Brown
I mean, I thought, I'm still thinkin'
Hop in my scraper, what you smoke, what you drinkin'?
Do me 'cause I'ma sho' do you
What it, dookie? Yadda daa, boo boo
I want your girl, she's so damn fine

104,I Want to Be Free (That's the Truth),1992,Shorty the Pimp  (1992),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"You think Oakland, California, is a city of punks
It only takes a second to pop the trunk
And just like that, you know it's real
You're in the right damn town to get killed
It's all about the game and nothin' else
You come out here, you better watch yourself
'Cause you can wear what you want, even blue or red
But cross the wrong brothers and end up dead
You catch a body full of bullets and get blasted
Tryin' to be a gangsta but you just ain't lastin'
This little town is gettin' wild as hell
Check the penetentiaries and all the jails
If they could lock us all up, that would be just fine
Got my partners from Oakland doin' serious time
You can't argue with the truth, it's hard to be black
But it's a mindgame and you gotta deal with that
I wake up everyday and I just can't wait
To make mo money 'cause back in the days
When I rapped, I did the same damn thing I do now
Grab the microphone and show you how
But I was broke, the only thing I had was game
I started makin' money and knew things would change
Bought a Benz, thought it might earn respect
But the OPD found it hard to accept
I got jacked by the [unverified]
Face down on the ground, keep my hands in sight
Put the handcuffs on backseat, I'm in it
Illegal search for about thirty minutes
Askin' me where's the dope
Where's my gun but I don't know
I said I'm rappin', they laugh like I told a joke
And to this day they think I'm sellin' coke
I want to be free, oh yeah
(And that's the truth)
I want to be free, oh yeah
I be in Oakland, California every day of my life
Bass so hard, you think I'm smokin' a pipe
And if I don't smoke it, I gots to grind
Searched all my stuff and all you find
Is a pocket full of money, count seven G's
Now you wanna think I'm sellin' keys
'Cause I'm a black man, but I run my own business
So why the police wanna send me to prison
They see a brother makin' major cash
They knock a patch out his black ass
And that's the truth, you can't argue you at all
Tryin' to give you ten years for a phone call
Ain't even trippin' on the dank smoke
'Cause all they wanna find is guns and coke
In court all the time, tryin' to fight it
We get rich, we get [unverified]
So what's the problem officer, this time?
Is havin' big money, bein' black a crime?
Or did you take me to jail to teach me a lesson
Charge me with somethin' or just ask questions
About the brothers I hang around?
What's really goin' on in the Oakland town?
Tell me who went broke, and who got rich
But Too $hort baby, just ain't no snitch
You say you're just doin' your job
But you're gettin' on my nerves, just like Bob
Every time I hit a corner, I see you
Always tellin' brothers what to do
You lock me up 'cause I don't know how to act
But I'm down for mine, so I be talkin' back
And when I do, you treat me bad as hell
I'm sick of spendin' nights in jail
I want to be free, oh yeah

I want to be free, oh yeah
Got out of jail about [unverified]
Walkin' down the street like a broke dopefiend
Had a pocket full of money tryin' to play the role
Benz got towed and I was hella cold
But I ain't trippin', I'm gettin' used to it now
Handcuffed, your boy took me straight downtown
For three warrants, had to catch me sooner or later
'Cause the five-oh's always tryin' to jack a playa
For no reason, wasn't doin' nothin' wrong
You think I'm lyin', singin' that same ol song
Well I'm a black man, ridin' in a Benz
How in the hell did I make these ends?
Here we go, I pull over to the right
Stop the engine, keep my hands in sight
I start cursin' 'cause it don't make sense
Why would I run and try to jump a fence
If I was plannin' a smooth getaway
I never woulda stopped in the first place
You'd be high speed chasin' me but this time you ain't
'Cause all I got on me is a big fat bank
And I hope I don't get robbed by you know who
Make me donate some G's to the boys in blue
And if I sue, I won't get nothin' back
But I ain't mad, I'm just black

I want to be free, oh yeah
I want to be free, oh yeah"

Fuck with me you better make somethin'
'Cause I'll never see a hoe and don't take nothin'
I was raised to break 'em
You got a purse full of hundreds? I'ma take 'em
Square bitches always fall in love
I call 'em bitch hoe tramp slut all the above
And when I turn 'em out, and send 'em to work
It feels good, knowin' I'm pimpin' 'em first
I wear a mack hat, real fly with a tilt
When I was 7, girls used to buy me milk
In middle school, I used to get it fool
Lunch money, and they let me hit it too
Cause all I ever wanted was a Cadillac
And some hoes that'll call me Daddy Mack

Bitch I'm gone! (Is you gone?)
Bitch I've been gone! (Is you gone?)

If I wanted I could have any woman in the world

I'm in it for the money, fuck the game
But everybody seems to know my name
And these hoes, know I ain't playin'
Bitch I'm gone, and I ain't never comin' back
Yeah I'm both - I'm a player and a mack
You ain't stupid! You know the business
You under new management and gotta go get it
Next time I see you have a stack of Ben Franks
Give it all to me, and tell a pimp thanks
Stuff it in the matress, we don't put it in the bank
Hundred thousand dollar car, puttin' gas in the tank
Use my phone, tell your man you chose
Fuck all that old shit and get some brand new clothes

You wanna go with me straight to the top?
You gotta check yes or no in the box
I was tellin' hoes that shit in '76
All them dreams I used to have I knew I'd better get rich
I wanted all the bad bitches, and all the cars
Drop my top at night and see all the stars
I used to walk down the street daydreamin
And now it came true, these bitches stay creamin
And I still don't give no bitches no slack
Get involved with me, fo' sho' bitch you know that
I don't hold back, I put it out there
Do everything I say and don't doubt a player
'Cause if you do - I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
I'm through, I don't want nuttin from you

How much she got from the tricks today
It's a normal thing for me to get paid
And my hookers don't stand at the intersection
Them tricks go surfin on the internet
And then I count it that night, or maybe in the mornin
I'm just another pimp from California
Oakland, up in the bay
We break new hoes in every day
How many hoes you got, don't ask tonight
Cause these hoes get turned out faster than lights
I've been countin' G's for days
Who cares if she leaves or stays
I get somethin' for nothin', cause you wanna touch her
Hug her and love her, I get paid and say fuck her
'Cause if I cain't get mine
You ain't gettin' shit you better wait in line
If I cain't get mine
You ain't gettin' shit you better wait in line

I'm on the grind, for every nickel and dime
I let a bitch get mine, and then I spit these rhymes
No it's not a freestyle, it's me
I just wanna be wild and see
How the hoes start choosin' when the pimps walk in
Shut your mouth up when a pimp's talk-in
Beeatch, I know you heard
I got the whole world sayin' my favorite word
I got your ex-girl layin in my bed, she's work
Seen her at the club and she had to flirt
I smoke the pert, I light it up
Yeah I'm a pimp but I like to fuck
Sexy lil' long-haired women
But I still let 'em know that I'm pimpin'
'Cause if I cain't get mine
You ain't gettin' shit you better wait in line
If I cain't get mine
You ain't gettin' shit you better wait in line
'Cause I'm pimpin', pimpin', pimpin', pimpin'
I'm pimpin', pimpin', pimpin', I'm pimpin' baby!
""I'ma see if I can go catch me, a nice pretty young bitch""
{*Phone rings*} ""Hold on, let me see what bitch that is""
""Okay this the bitch here right now, y'knahmsayin?""
""Hey bitch, what's happenin'? I already know what you fin' to say bitch""
""Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, only thang you do bitch, is just go to work
Handle my business, get my money, don't give me no problems, everythang gon' be all right"""

Uh
Hey yo $hort, they ain't ready for this one nigga
Yeah
Whatever you want I got it, ammos, cars and chips
Yards of sniff, flood the boulevard with bricks
Hard or soft, raw get flipped, B.I. slash O.G
Know about hoes, broads and strips
Hatchback I stuff 'em all with dicks, nasty nigga
Whup mo' ass than Steven Seagal in flicks
Like, it's a Spike thing, I do the right thing
Smack ass silly, bitches call me Sweet Dick Willie
Cause my cum, tastes like Now or Laters
So it attracts like strawberries and crocodile gators
On backs like a scout for the Raiders
Turn wifes into hoes so if your girlfriend blow, then she go
If she ain't legal, she can't mob at Teddy's
We can't bump and grind and I ain't Robert Kelly
So act like the broad in _Belly_, face down
Ass up, that's how I like to fuck
(Chorus: unknown female)
Whatever you want I got it
If there's money to make, let's spend it
Whatever you need, come get it
And it feels so good to me - I'm wit it
(Too $hort)
I'm lovin' life, what'chu want me to say?
I'm tryin' to tell the whole world, they goin' dumb in the bay
They don't care if you don't like it, it's fun anyway
We smoke bomb in the bay on a sunny day
It's rainin buds, comin' straight from Humboldt
Got a blunt rolled, a trunk full and still want mo'
It's not enough, light it up and get fucked up
You got a rat in the hood, 'bout to get sucked up
Yeah bitch, shut up and swallow the nut
Or turn around, and let me shoot it all in yo' butt
'Cause I'm a freaky nigga when I get these sluts
And you a nasty girl, you like to lick these nuts
So when you call my phone and say pick me up
Cause you want me to shove this dick in yo' gut
I'ma do it, fold you like a 50 dollar bill
Fuck you real good and say, ""Bitch how's it feel?""
(Unknown female)
Feels so good to me (*3X*)
Feels so good to me - I'm wit it
(Someone)
Ay 'Face man why don't you let these punk-ass niggas know what time it is
(Scarface)
I don't wanna let these niggaz know what time it is
Because if I let niggaz know what time it is
Then niggaz is gon' tryin' to use they clocks to try to set they time to mine
Dig that

You see I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage & a weddin' ring
I be a player for life. So where's my wife?
Probably at the rehab stuck at the pipe
'Cause she must be smokin' & I'm not jokin'
Too $hort baby comin' straight from Oakland
Got way mo' bitches than I ever need
I put that on a big fat bag of weed
'Cause I can give you a bitch who wouldn't give you joint
Bitches Ain't Shit and now I made my point
So you can light that weed
While I spit this rap
And tell you about a player from way back
I was only 14 when I first got my dick sucked
Now I'm grown up & I really like to bust nuts
Gittin' freaky in the right situations.
You wanna rap? Well that's a nice occupation
To get pussy when you want 'n' how you want it fool'
'Cause I was fuckin' ugly hoes back in high school'
I used to fuck young ass hoes
Used to be broke and didn't have no clothes
Now I fuck top notch bitches
Tellin' stories 'bout rags to riches
About a pimp named $horty from the Oakland set
Been mackin' for years 'n' ain't fell of yet
So if you ever see me rollin' in my drop top caddy
Throw a peace sign and say ""Hey pimp daddy!""
'Cause I never would front' on my folks
I slow down and let the gold diggers count my spokes
Bitches come a dime a dozen
So don't get mad when I fuck your cousin
Your 2 sisters, I even fuck your ex-bitch

Look fo' a tramp, but you can't find 'em
You got 1 girlfriend and you see her every night
Comin' around the partners, lyin' about your life
Looked at your watch it said 6:22
Cut to the house and said ""Baby I love you""
Can't act like a mack like playboy $ho'
An' the rest of the macks in the streets of the O bitch!
Comin' up we learn how to ""BREAK"" these hoes
And when your through gettin' yours then you shake these hoes
And when your older, it's nothin' but a routine
Makin' G's everyday workin' blue jeans
I know I seen it before
I see it again

$Hort Dog. What you do about them player haters?
Try 'n' stay away from Kriss Kross imitators
Put you in a cross 'cause they really jus' haters
I thought you knew, $hort Dog is a player
Born to mack 'n' got bitches everywhere
I ride around town in my clean ass cars
Screenin' these hoes like movie stars
Checkin' my traps like a dirty rat
I was born to mack
I'm hookin' hoes like crack, I be a monkey on your back bitch
Until you kick that $hort Dog habit got you all on my dick
And even though I can't fuck you every day
""IT'S"" 'cause I got another bitch around' the way

Cut to the house hook somethin' up real tight

Now all you one-rap rappers what are you doin'
I got so many raps so just go right through 'em
My name is short but I rap long rhymes
Hand me your mic I do it all the time
Now could you be like me I hate to say it
It's like comparin' mickey d's and quick ways
You only got 3 stores I got the whole wide world
I get beeps everyday from your favorite girl
But I'm such a dog I never call tha freak
Hit it once and she was just too weak
At my house I keep finer things
The candy paints, got her sprung on my diamond rings
She could live like a queen if she was miss too $hort
Have 2 babies, get child support
But at this point she gets nathin from me
I ain't fakin' it, freak, I'm just makin' the beat
So don't dance, ride the strip
All day long playin' too $hort hits
Pop in the tape and start ridin'

Make it hit so hard just like a punch in the back
It's that dopefiend beat got my rap on your plate
Tryin' to bite my style and make a demo tape
Now could you be like me or someone else
Bass hittin' hard like the freaky tales
Oaktown style it goes just like this
If you never heard me rap don't trip
'Cause I hit the scene with my homie too clean
We slap hands like a tag team
Some people say they don't like cali raps
People like that must be smokin' that crack
I rhyme good it's been 10 long years
Gettin' sick of all that stuff I always hear
Too $hort can't rap, he's from the westcoast
Between me and you patna I sell the most

Where they at, where they at, where they at
I sold tapes every day me and freddy b
Been famous since 1983
Give me ten dollars, and you straight get blessed
A rap all about you called the special request
Oakland, you know I go way back
To coug nuts, fal stangs, and cadillac's
When homeboys put vogues on any car
With 6 by 9's smoking burners
Everybody got addicted to my dopefiend beat
Whole town fucked around and started smoking d
Every rap I ever made was about this town
I made 7 whole albums with no james brown
And even though I love his music, I just can't stand
The way they used it all up and didn't pay the man
And after 2 platnum albums, you call me weak
'Cause I don't sell records in the east
Now what's funky, I say pussy on an old hoe
I guess y'all fools don't know
Why some good rappers can't sell no tapes
It's not the company's fault, the shit sounds fake
You wanna be in the trunk, with the booming box
While the young bitches ride on your jock
You can't do it like this homey, so just pass it
And stop kissing them white folks asses
It's like you smoked a whole damn key
You rap so fast you keep leaving the beat
I'm from the old school, I love p-funk
But now rap music is all that they want
So when I'm in my car, I play clinton
And when I'm on the stage I start pimping
And when I hear your shit, I push eject
Then I throw it out the window with the rejects
And when the hard core rappers go soft
I like to watch when they ass fall off
Cause ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucka MC
And any other rappers ever talk about me
I don't stop rapping, that's all they can say
And how I dogg bitches, every day
But if you can't be a dogg, then you're weak
You be phony like a side show freak
Some rappers try to come off positive
Where I'm from that just ain't how it is
They say rap music is here to stay
But the sucka MC's don't think that way
It took 8 long years before I got my break
So I wonder why rapper's make fake ass tapes
You won't get paid like I did, so give up punk
And while you're in the studio, I'm in the trunk
You got no choice, so don't flip that coin
This ain't the military, so you punks can't join
It ain't pop, it's called underground rap
From oakland California and the shit sounds phat
I'm spitting raps to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I used to be broke, but now we all used to be
Got no game for a bitch, all the game is for me
And these bitches, can't say shit to me
They could never could fuck with short baby
I'm not a tongue twisting rapper with a funny style
Don't dress hip hop and dance real wild
But I do sell records like a motherfucker
Even though you might I'm just another sucka
I find the beat and then never switch
Grab the microphone and then call you a bitch
You want rent money, I got pimp money
One thing's for sure, I won't give it to a hoe
I throw a bitch in the God damn trunk
And start slamming that oakland funk
Short dogg's in the house, once again
Trying to fade the platnum, with shorty the pimp
And when I do, I'm going straight to the bank
Withdraw some money and buy some dank
You can't relate to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I grew up on the funk called p
But these motherfuckers growing up on me
And if I ego trip, and my head is fucked
I take my ass back, to where I grew up
And get real boy, it's never too late
Before I do like you and make a weak ass tape
I'm in the trunk...
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk beating down the block
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk, in, in the trunk

(Girl speaks to Too $hort in non-English language)
(Too $hort)
I love women and they love me
I ain't really trippin' on nationalities
Black girls, white girls, mix 'em up
Half-breeds, I can't get enough
In the Bay, where the players play
We keep it international every day
Asian girls are so terrific
What'chu mean $hort? Be mo' specific
Filipino, Japanese
Cambodian, Thai and Vietnamese
Malaysian girls from Singapore
China dolls, I'll name some more
I know Korean chicks, girls from Laos
It's like the United Nations at my house
I got Indian girls from India
They like to make out and get finger fucked
(Girl speaks to Too $hort and then says ""Okay? Later"")
(Another girl speaks in Spanish)
(Too $hort)
You look like you come from Guatemala
El Salvador or Nicaragua
Sounds to me like you're speakin' Spanish
You're talkin' but I cain't understand it
You ain't no Mexican
I don't care, let's have sex again
Everything I do, I do the best
Got a big booty girl from Budapest
If she ain't fine I say HELL NO
Give me that Rio de Janeiro
Brazilian bodies, tall exotic
I want all the hotties you call erotic
Black girls get mad sometimes
They tell me keep my ass in line
But I know how to pass the time
You can sell that pussy but the cash is mine
(More foreign girls with foreign tongues)
(Too $hort)
Where you from baby, Argentina?
You a movie star? I thought I seen her
Called her Eva, but it didn't work
She was swingin' that ass in a mini-skirt
Well let me know what'chu wanna do
You beautiful, look like you from Peru
A good girl or a nasty whore
That's all I'm asking for
She can be Australian, Canadian
Persian, Armenian
Ethiopian, Somalian
Spanish, Italian
She can be Cuban, Puerto Rican
Haitian, or Jamaican
In the Bay where the players play
We keep it international, every day
(Girls keep talking until the song's end)"

Baby, check this out
Yeah you
I wanna ask you a question
Where is yo ass?
Babby, what happened?
A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with alotta butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's OK if she's got cash
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
I'll tell you 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin' but bitches with no ass
I woke up early feelin' shabby
Got juiced up with a big fat Cabby
'Cause every morning you know I have
A big fat Cabby and a nice hot bath
Just soakin, smokin', Sir Too Short
Thinkin' about the day before
Thirty minutes after I woke out
I pulled a freak and took her to the house
She was Eleve Young, with alotta butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That good tight pussy, I wouldn't pass
A light-skinned freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin' away
I wanna do the same thing again today
I want bitches, bitches, and more bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The day my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself I must need glasses
Where's them bitches with the big brown asses
Me and my group just wanna be tough
Freak two bitches then switch 'em up
It was 3:35, the strip was lit
Every two blocks I seen a bitch
But that ain't nothin' but a cat
None of them bitch didn't have no ass
Wait on the bus, some was walkin'
Me and my homie just started talkin'
I said, oh, she looks good
He said that ass is flat as wood
I said what about Vicky in the black
He said, Short, she's all that
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The Invasion was on...
Every single day of the week
For every nigga livin' there's a freak
If you've got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
'Cause bitches all over wanna get worked
I just need one with alotta turf
Me and my homie, rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie, I hate to say
All the bitches with booties stayed home today
And he said Short, what now?
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the B-Town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
We hit the B-Town like Oakland flares
I knew it, bitches was everywhere
The first one had tits so fat
But that don't work, her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
I capped on her like a motherfuckin fool
I said be-atch, I know I'm cappin
Where's your ass, baby what happened
She turned around and capped on me
She said, fuck you nigga, where's your teeth
I damn near fell jumpin' out the car
But I slapped that bitch, and slapped her hard
My homie said Short we gots to cut
But I was kickin that bitch and her big flat butt
I kicked her ass, got in the ride
Looked at the bitch and said bye bye
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The invasion was on...
We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk
I said baby, baby, baby come here
Yeah you baby with your long long hair
Baby came over from across the street
She was standin on the corner just talkin' to me
I was spittin' the game but I talked to fast
'Cause I didn't even notice that big flat ass
Shit, and I was ready to go
We was rollin' back to the O
I told that bitch I changed my mind
She looked at me and she said why?
I said I'm Sir Too Short, the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and yo flat booty
Flat ain't the date superstar
I could see if you was white, but your black as tar
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
In the Berkeley temp, what did we find?
Freak after freak with no behind
One long day, I never got in
I'm glad that shit never happened again

You want me to say I do?
I L-O-V-E Y-O-U
You love me don't you, now it's true
The opposite, that's how I do
Relationships, they come and go
Next thing you know she's on the flo'
Dancin, she wants some mo'
Her ex-boyfriend he'll never know
She's still sprung, can't tell her nuttin
She was young, when she fell in love with him
Used to spend every day with him
He cheated, and now she's hatin' him
He's a fraud, don't tell her that
You can do a background credit check
Show her how to have better sex
And it still ain't over - never that~!
It ain't over, I want you to get it closer
Wanna get to know what, what I want will get me goin'
It ain't over, got a man but he ain't gonna
Wanna get me goin', come on baby show me what's up
(Too $hort)
I wanna go there wit'chu
Do the house and the kids too
I know what it is wit'chu
You high, girl I'm thizzin too!
So you gotta be home at 10?
Next time I see you it's on again
I shoulda known your man'd
Hit redial, and call your phone again
Who's ass is that?
Bitch don't ask me that
I'm keepin' you, I won't pass it back
Let it ring don't answer that
Unless you wanna tell him now
While we havin' sex and you hella loud
Screamin and yellin' out
Tell him what we all about
You say you want it and that I'm in love
I got another but I'm feeling yah
You so hot, but I been involved too long
It ain't over, boy I just can't go, oh no
(Too $hort)
You think he slept around
Held you back and kept you down
You was sad, are you happy now?
At your momma and your daddy's house
With a sad and long face
Wishin you had yo' own place
You've been lonely lately
Even tried to go on and datin
But then you met me, I'm a different type
Can't fall in love, I'm pimpin' right
Probably wanna fuck by the end of the night
Push your dress up and your panties aside
The best ever, it can't be true
I'ma pull on your hair and spank you too
You like it rough, I think you do
I'ma beat it up till the pink turn blue
You say you want it and that I'm in love
I got another but I'm feeling yah
You so hot, but I been involved too long
It ain't over, boy I just can't go, oh no
It ain't over, I want you to get it closer
Wanna get to know what, what I want will get me goin'
It ain't over, got a man but he ain't gonna

119,It Don't Stop,1992,Shorty the Pimp  (1992),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Funky fresh on the muthafuckin microphone
Bitch
And it don't stop
To the beat, baby
Oakland, California is in the house
Bitch
I tell you, nobody does it better than too $hort
I got so many raps, I know you can't have more
'Cause I grew up on the mic, I spent my whole life
Writin raps, late at night
And I never would make no fake LP's
Sucker MC's don't make no g's
They make weak, weak raps, and need to quit
22 songs, and only 3 on hit
Frontin on me like you want some
Better sell a million records, go platinum
'Cause I wouldn't waste my time on a one-rap rapper
You wanna get with me, you gotta climb that ladder
But you ain't nothin' but a joke
Rappers make money, tell me why are you broke?
We get paid like a muthafucka, and we get
A brand-new house full of brand-new shit
A brand-new car in my brand-new driveway
I always keep the top down on the highway
Too $hort, baby, known everywhere
Had a life-long dream to be a player
Way too cold at a younger age
It was everyday, 'just make that pay'
12 years later, still in the game
And you never talk down on a player's name
'Cause I'm (too $hort, too $hort)
You see, I'm fresh like always with funky beats
I say what's up to the brothers on 10th street
It's goin' down in the oakland town
Home of the infamous too $hort sound
So keep your jealous-ass thoughts in your diary
And if you're lookin' for a leader, you can hire me
And if your so-called boss don't pay
The only thing you need to say
Is I quit, I'm through with you
Pack up your raps, and join the dangerous crew
We got mo' beats than the average joe
And a 24-track studio
So forget what you heard, and we'll see it's on
Oakland, California can't leave me alone
'Cause I'm the most rappin', most rhymin
Sold my drop-top, but I'm still high-sidin
I'm (too $hort, too $hort)
Now that I've established my career
I wanna help some other brothers out here
Hook 'em up and let 'em make some dough
Flip benzes and turn out shows
Cause oakland got talent, fool
MC's in elementary school
Not to mention musicians and singers
And shorty b with his magical fingers
We get funky like skunk weed
Light it up, hit it, and get keed
This dopefiend beat will get you high
If it don't go gold too soon, I'll cry
If the bass ain't deep, somethin's wrong
It must not be a real too $hort song
Cause the first thing I do when I make my tape
Is drop a few kicks from my 808
And when my tapes hit the store, they sell so quick
You can tell by my big fat royalty check
It's just a dangerous thing when I'm on the mic
And the local police don't even like
The way we hit your town, it's so funny
It's all about makin' big money
So before I go, you should remember this
Muthafuck you, damn shithead bitch
'Cause I'm (too $hort, too $hort)"
120,It's All Good,1993,Get In Where You Fit In (1993),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Man, this bitch blowin' my beeper up.
Ready to put a hole up in one of these bitches, man.
Sup? Guess you wondered where I was at
When you beeped me last night & I didn't call back
Supposed to be there, meet you at the house at 9
You made a candlelight dinner just to wine and dine
And I didn't even show up
You beeped me 20 million times, made my beeper blow up
Thought you shot me to the left 'cause I'm a D O G
But you called so I guess it's still cool for me
To get freaky, you know I got that git back
I come right when I hit that
And if you tell me right now it's cool today
As soon as I'm through I be on my way.
Do I look like the type of lady
That'll talk to a brother that's shady, hell no
But you can wine and dine me
Spend a little time with me, It's All Good
'Cause I love the way you take me
Oh boy you shake me, when we lay down
Got my head spinnin' around.
I need a woman that's down for me
Always on my side, not my enemy
We could be gangsta's, lovers, parents, or friends
But whatever we do, do it straight to the end
We'll make love like professionals
You and me baby, fuck the rest of them hoes
You know how much we like bein' together
Seems like every second, it's gettin' wetter
So good I wish it'd last forever
'Cause it would never get no better than this
I know you feel the same
Moanin' so loud all the neighbors complained
And all the people tried to tell you I was phony
Talkin' all that junk and don't even know me
Last night I was chillin' at the club
Chillin' with my partners when your friends rolled up
Flirtin' with your nigga behind your back
They called you on the phone and told you where I was at
Your girlfriends tryin' to run your world
You'd better stop listenin' to them other girls.
Never cared about those other girls
It's something about the way you rock my world
Even though you make me cry
I still wait alone for you at night, but It's All Good.
I couldn't come home last night 'cause I was out makin' money
But I'll come home tonight if you want me
'Cause you sure lookin' good today
I take you to your house and let you have it your way.
Ooh boy, oh, It's All Good, It's All Good to me, baby.
I just keep on fuckin' you all night long
Me and you baby got it goin' on
You ain't trippin' every time you see me
You get loose and you get so freaky
I never meant to break your heart
You gave it all to me & I tore it apart
Talked about love right to the end
But I'm a tell you like it is, I'll never do it again
I'm from east oakland, I'm an ice cold player
Born to mack and got women everywhere
I got one up in E.P.A.
And 2 down in south central L.A.
One in frisco and one in berkeley
Got a few southern girls just to work me.
Is that what you wanted to hear?
That your man is the player of the year?
I need a woman that's down for me
Always on my side, not my enemy
We could be gangsta's, lovers, parents, or friends
But whatever we do, do it straight to the end
I said the very same thing in the beginnin'
We played the game but it's in the 9th innin'
You'd better wake up and smell the dank
It really don't seem to be what you think, bitch
I'm all about gettin' my bank
You be the car & I'll fill your tank
'Cause nothin' don't come for free
Unless your ass don't want to be with me, bitch.
Boy, have you been listening?
I can't let you go since I know what I'm missin'
And can you fell it in my touch
That I want you so much and It's All Good
It's All Good, baby
I'm tryin' to tell you boy, that it's good
It's All Good, It's All Good, baby baby baby
Oh, like that baby, like that
It's All Good, It's All Good
It's All Good, It's All Good."

They just wanna make you disappear
Get the f*** up out a b*** ear
Take that s*** back over there
Go away, she don't wanna know you, player
What you gotta say? Just like this
Loud as you can, say, ""F*** that b***""

Roll out with you and give you some
I don't think that's goin' down

We could hook up, make love and play
It really can't happen no other way

Don't leave anything in my room
I got another freak, she'll be here soon
She might not be as wild you
It's 4 A.M. and right now she'll do
She's not a super freak and she's not a h***

We did what we did so let's do what we do
We had fun but now I'm through with you
I gotta run, I'll call you in a few days
I'll be back to get some more
'Cause you do it better than most
At this rate, we'll probably never be close
But that's okay 'cause that's not the mission
You could cheat on your man if you got permission
I'll give it to ya, I'll beat it so well
When we finished, we gotta leave the hotel
That's all, I'm the number one player
You can call or I'll see you somewhere
As long as we make this happen again
Yo' fine a*** sittin' back in the Benz
'Cause yours is the best, I must confess
But right now, it's time to get dressed

'Cause when you waste it...
Nowwwwwwwwwwww I come from, the oakland town
Task force roll and rock, cold cracked down
Young brothers my age makin' dollars so long
Drive a brand new benz with a cellular phone
See his diamonds and gold, call him big bank bob
Got a ring for each finger and he can't get a job
This is not a song I made about crack
It's all about losin what you can't get back
Cause the name of the game is to control yo' life
And all the things you do you must do them right
It's not my life, it's on you baby
What's really goin' on is that cash money
How you make it, it doesn't matter to me
Work at macdonald's or just slang them ki's
Or you can be like me and go straight legit
Drive a brand new benz and they can't say shit

Partners in your face, ain't even your friend
Probably have to blast him if you see him again
And if you don't blast him you'll get shot in the head
Seven days later you'll be buried and dead
I can't be like that, the only thing you fear
Homeboy you can't see it but you know it's there
It's called tomorrow, whatcha gonna do with that
Cut school, sell a few dopefiends crack?
It's not a one-way street, it's more like a dead-end
So if you take it, you better turn back my friend
I know a lot of young brothers don't think things through
They really don't know what they wanna do
When you lag, you lose, you start payin' your dues
You can't kick back and let your bankroll stack
You'll be stuck on stupid, for smokin' a friend
Ten years from now you'll still be in the pen
It's your life, don't be stupid dope...

Am I a gangster, player, makin' them g's
Cocaine dealer with the z's and v's
Can't tell 'em nothin', so I say, whassup?
They get mad, I don't give a fuck
I keep ridin', sidin, whippin and dippin
Look at all my homeboys trippin'
They'll knock you out, one punch like the champ
Goin' to jail is like summer camp
We shake hands one day, kill each other the next
And if you don't like it it's just like that
'Cause I come from, the city of dope
It couldn't be saved by john the pope
But since I have the chance, I'll say in the rhyme:
We have to stop the killin' sometime (soon)

All the homies in the pen straight locked down
But I gotta get dressed & hit the oaktown
I called Randy ??Olson?? on the telephone
Early in the mornin' but he still ain't home
So I called Ant Banks to see what's up
He said meet me at the studio at 2:00
I got dressed, smokin' on some serious dank
Grabbed my keys off the table & a big ol' bank
I hit interstate 80 & I'm rollin'
Joint's still burnin' & I'm smokin'
I was on my way to San Jose
To the stereo shop to make my music play
'Cause one amp shut down & the bass ain't playin'
Didn't take long, for Joel & Janks to have me slumpin'
So I called Apu: what's up nigga? What you about to do?
He said, just kickin' back waitin' on the fellas
About to go eat at Della's
I said it sure sounds good to me
I can't go though, gotta hit Myrtle Street
Passed the acorns on my way, bitch. It's Just Another Day.
Big Banks came through & started mixin'
Sittin' in the studio kick back listenin'
To some funky ass shit from the Dangerous Crew
Debbie D came through, with FM Blue
Shorty B rolled up smokin' fat ones
Pee-Wee had a crew in the back room
Goldie had the tramps givin' head breakin' off
Rappin' Ron /Ant diddley-dog
Twin 1 & 2 is tellin' stories
About beatin' down niggas for the glory
Had to catch a plane that night & roll out of town
Everybody gettin' high tryin' hard to clown
I had to go shop fo' it's time to leave
I dipped to the mall, flipped me some jeans
Rolled on out like a player
Hot ass day, bitches everywhere
I'm leanin' hard to the left like a big shot
Checkin' out the hoes seein' who'll get knocked
'Cause when you fuck with $hort you get fucked quick
I run some drama on yo' ass & make you suck dick
Ride through the ??old?? scene ??beamin' it?? slow
Talkin' that shit 'about' niggas on the fo'
Drive crazy, tryin' to tear up shit
It's Just Another Day in Oakland bitch.
It was me, Jaque, ??Beamin'?? & ??T-Lo?
??Boo-kicke?? slow motion & ??P-O??
Spud, Ju-Ju, Frog & Big E
Gettin' high on our street
Bug, Joe-A, Ce-Ce & Mark,
Rollin' 4 deep from SobranI Park
Howard came through from the B-Town
Muthafuckers gettin' high it's goin' down
It's the same everyday everyday it's the same
But that night we hit the hoop game
Who was playin': Seattle versus Golden State
Hollered at the homeboy Gary Payton
After the game, we went to his house
NBA Jams, tripped us out
Niggas talkin' 'about slammin' bones
Any kinda way to get your gamble on
Bet, all you kept hearin' was bet
Dice game on the pool table fuck that shit
I ain't goin' outta town broke
I gotta have a bank get some dank to smoke.
Think I'm gamblin'? You must be insane
It started gettin' late I had to catch that plane
So I cut to the airport
Just Another Day for Too $hort.
I was high as fuck on the airplane
Thinkin' to myself about a street gang
How a black man'll do you in a minute
Walk around the corner see some shit & get in it
How the police always tryin' to catch us
Fell asleep & woke up in Houston Texas
Gangsta ass niggas from the 5th & the 3rd
Check yo' ass there nigga fuck what ya heard
Next night we did a show, in New Orleans
Same gangsta's same old scene
Yellin' at 7th that 9th ward
I see my homies from the 3rd & the 4th
It was me Big Dog & the EL Guarde posse
Havin' fun & you just can't stop me
I did a show in Birmingham Alabama
Then caught a plane Atlanta
I heard about the muthafuckin' freaknick
Popped that pussy hoe fuck that weak shit
You should've seen all the bitches on the street
Niggas from Detroit was deep
All my partners from the Oak flew up
& they was slangin' that danky stuff
Gettin' high with some brothers from MiamI & Cleveland
Kickin' back talkin' about we ain't leavin'.
Bitch. We ain't goin' nowhere you know what I'm sayin'? 
It's Just Another Day. 
Aww you know
Kick it wit the Cadillac Club 
F R O G ????

Ain't no rehab for pussy, it won't hurt me
You just like cigarettes and goin' cold turkey

Nasty ass hoes'll give you stank mouth
First thing in the morning, she's on your mind
Twenty minute kisses, all the time
Bomb ass head, hit it from the back
She be ridin' yo' dick like a horse bareback
You ever wonder where she learned that?
The bitch'll pull a pimp's perm back
Special handlin, dick's the package

But see I don't play that shit, I beat a bootch down with a belt buckle
The first thing you wanna do is go down on a botch, and eat her crabby
KNOWIN' that there botch still got lead in her ass from yesterday
I'm on your botch -- size 44D bodacious breasts
But the bitch got mo' miles on her THAN SOUTHWEST
Don't, you, get it dis-com-bob-u-la-ted (discombobulated)
She used to have a 70's bush - until I shaved it (until I shaved it)
Beatch, beatch!

Man look at her, baby look good
The way she dancin, maybe I should
Step up to her, and run this game
I wanna FUCK - I don't wanna know her name
I play the role though, act like I'm interested
By the end of the night, she done been molested
And she loves it, that's how I do it
You tried to get with her too but you blew it
I told her I ain't had no woman, I got three
And you ain't leavin' this club without me
'Cause I'll be - your breakfast in the mornin
See the sun rise while you're nake and you're moanin
And when I get up, talkin' like a pimp
That's when reality, starts to sink in
You want me to fuck yo' pussy till it hurts
And I wanna put yo' fine ass to work, bitch
Bitches always tellin' me
You're a player (a real player)
I don't care about these other hoes
Just keep fuckin' me (keep it up in you, way up)
I can look in yo' eyes and see I got you
You so fine girl I had to knock you
We left the bar, we in the car
I'm treatin this bitch like a movie star
It's all game, I just wanna hit it quick
Try to turn a bitch out so I can hit a lick
And it's a trip, she's such a good bitch
Mama told you bout niggaz that look slick
You knew about the hoes when you met me
I'll add you to my stable if you let me
So you can get me, what I need so quickly
I want G's bitch, about a hundred fifty
All these hoes, know my style
I'll put you to work but don't go too wild
'Cause we'll get this cash, just take our time
Choose or leave, you better make up yo' mind

You're a player (that's right, I'm a fuckin' player bitch)
I don't care about these other hoes (na nah)
Just keep fuckin' me
You said put it all up in you, keep on fuckin' you
Knew what time it was and I knew just what to do
Bitch I get at you, have you stuck like a statue
Use nothin' but words and I have you
I give a fuck if you think I'm too rich
I ain't gon' cash you out like these new tricks
She wanna eat, drink and fuck good
That won't make you get my cash, but what would?
If I turned you on to this player life
Quit fuckin' rich niggaz tryin' to be a wife
I can show you how to put this game to work
Don't do it, unless you put some change in yo' purse
Bitch you know whassup wit me
I'm from the O, I roll in luxury

128,Life Is...Too Short,1988,Life Is... Too $hort (1988),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"I remember how it all began
I used to sing dirty raps to my East Side fans
Back then I knew ya couldn't stop this rap
No M.C. could rock like that
Then the new style came, the bass got deeper
Ya gave up the mike and bought you a beeper
Do ya wanna rap or sell coke?
Brothers like you ain't never broke
People wanna say it's just my time
Brothers like me had to work for mine
Eight years on the mike and I'm not jokin'
Sir Too $hort comin' straight from Oakland, California, home of the rock
Eight woofers in the trunk, beatin' down the block
Short dog, I'm that rappin' man
I said it before and I'll say it again
Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Life is to some people unbearable
Committin' suicide and that's terrible
Was it much too much or nothing big?
If ya live my life, you'd be fightin' to live
Life is to me my main asset
I be doin' all right and keep it just like that
Chill out at the house and pump that bass
I'm tryin' to get rich as I rock the place
Everybody's got that same old dream
To have big money and fancy things
Drive a brand new Benz, keep your banck right here
Never hear me stutter once because I talk real clear
It's on you, homeboy, watcha gonna do?
You can take my advice and start workin', fool
Or you can close your ears and run your mouth
And one day, homeboy, ya soon find out
Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Life is too short, would you agree?
While I'm livin' my life, don't mess with me
It's been a long time, baby, since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds
'Cause I don't stop rappin', that's my theme
I make a lot of money, do you know what I mean?
Like this, complicated ya must stay up
Ya asked a simple question boy, don't say ""What?""
Ya only live once and ya callin' it hell
Policeman tryin' to take ya to jail
You could give a man time but you don't know
In a matter of time, I'll be runnin' the show
Now another young buck wants to be on top
Makin' big money, slangin' hop
The task force tryin' ta peel your cap
Turn around, homeboy, ya better watch your back
Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
You can take back all the things you give
But ya can't take back the days you live
Life is to some people heaven on earth
Livin' every single day for what it's worth
I live my life just how I please
Satisfy one person I know, that's me
Work hard for the things I achieve in life
And never rap fake when I'm on the mike
'Cause if a dream is all you got, homeboy
Ya gotta turn that dream into the real McCoy
Not time to waste, just get on that case
Can't be down 'cause ya need to taste the good life
Livin' like a king on a throne
Gettin' everything ya want and tryin' to have all your own
So life
Don't be stupid though
'Cause when ya waste it, you'll know
Life Is
Life Is
All right, that's it"

With a whole lot of ass in them pants
Do you think I'm a passionate man?
Ice cold player with a master plan
A lot of females just don't know
That lil' shorty got her own dough
When I met her it was on right away
If I was married, I'd leave my wife today
Light-skinned with the curly hair
Did my finger like this and said ""Girl come here""
She's on South Beach, havin' lunch with a dude
I whispered in her ear ""Later on come through""
Come on yo shorty we can kick it baby
You know that I'm with it
You can hit me on my phone
We can do it all night long

A super top notch, better get up on 'em
Ass fat, she's a class act
Menage-a-trois, she don't have that
She's all about them dimes and pennies
Tens and twenties, hundreds and fifties
Whatever you got she'll take it
Make a nigga stop, drop and get naked
I guess it's just a sign of the times
Cause shorty got a crib that's as fly as mines
Lil' shorty is a freak mayne
Gamed up with the street game
Did a lot and left me wantin mo'
Lil' shorty ain't no punk hoe
I don't sip fine wine or drink champagne
Don't mix with fake hoes that think I'm payin'
But I do like women, that know about pimpin'
Keep gettin' money so we don't stop spendin
Lil' shorty knows my background
I was raised out West in a mack's town

130,Little Girls,1987,Born to Mack (1987),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Little girls of the world, you're all so sprung
15, 16 and all so young
I thought about you just last night
Grabbed my pen then I started to write
A rap that'll cap like a true blue rap
Not a washed-up almost MC sap
Little girls so fresh and I know you are
Wanna take a little ride in my new car
I see you more than baby, it's more like hell
You screw a little girl and end up in jail
Even though she seems she's 19
You're looking at her body an it's breaking the jeans
Well you know she's not, so don't play dumb
Little girls walking round trying to give me some
But I tell 'em like this, I'm the player $hort
Playing freaks like you is just a sport
I'm coming way too real and I can never be funny
Niggas like me just want your money
Give it up, 'cause I'm no lost cause
Little girl recognize too $hort's the boss
When they turn 16, we all find out
What little girls like that are all about
So you girls out there, that fit my rhyme
You'd better think twice before you jump on mine
Little girl's so thick, you might think she's grown
But if you knew when she was born, you might leave her alone
She's trouble homeboy, with a big fat t
Little girls like that make old men pee
Then a brother like me might break my neck
Looking back saying ooh! bout to get in a wreck
'Cause she's always flirting, might give me a look
Like I put her in the oven and she started to cook
But when I put her on the spot, she could not hang
With my so rough, so tough playboy game
I only said two words, something like get busy
Her head started hurting and she got real dizzy
Growing up to fast, all you little girls
Letting brothers like me cold crush your world
Should've listen to your momma when she told you so
But you wnet and got g'd now you want some more
They ain't paying me money, talking bout love
And the other girl's who I'm thinking of
Can you understand, I'm just a man
I want to come in this world and cold take the man
So just step on back, while I walk on by
I might look you down, and I might say hi
And if you come up choosing, I just might laugh
Say little girl check me out in about two and a half... years
I took a little girl to a drive in show
Jumped in the back and heard no no no
She was only 16 but the girl was ripe
36-24 and a 35
I was wasting time spitting lines
Thinking bout going home cold getting mine
Baby said stop it I said drop it
I tried everything but I could not cop it
I was going to a store about a month ago
Met another girl that just loved my show
We talked for a while and it was all about
Having big fun later on at her house
She said her pops was gone but her mother was there
And everything was cool 'cause she don't care
So I gave her a ride, kissed her goodbye
I said I'd be back and we all know why
Went to find my thrill up on that hill
I was coming right back with the power drill
I had fun for a while but it wasn't enough
When it all got good, her pops showed up
He must have walked in the room and said young punk
'Cause when he walked in the room, he smelled the funk
Then he tried to mash, but I don't play
'Cause I was out of that window and on my way
Little girl
Every night you call and say come by
You tell me things changed and I know you lie
I came by last week, you said drive on up
And your pops came out talking all that stuff
Next night we made a date for 9 o'clock
And I always wondered why you walked the block
I saw you waiting on the corner when I made the turn
I didn't really think about it 'cause I wasn't concerned
I said, you look so good, but you always do
I was rushing to the house for the old 1 2's
But the ones ain't cool, and the twos don't work
Every time I tried, you kept saying it hurts
And then it all came out under all your tears
It seems you only been alive for 15 years
You could have fooled me baby with your lying scheme
Said you worked in the mall and just turned 18
When it came down to it, I couldn't go through it
It's all so sad cause you wanted to do it
Little girl, you want to have some fun
You'd better wait a few years 'cause you're much too young
Stop playing games, you might find a guy
Who will like you for yourself, not for all your lies
So I put it like this, and I don't play
If I see your young ass, I'm not going your way
You little girl"
131,Lollypops,2002,What's My Favorite Word? (2002),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Tell a nigga... telephone, telegram; two-way that motherfucker
Somebody let him know... tell that nigga
His bitch is out of pocket
It was me and yo' broad, ridin' in my 'llac
She tried to climb on top of me and slide on my lap
I said hold on baby, we almost to the spot
We gon' do somethin' nasty, with all this lust you got
I fucked her on the floor then we got up in the bed
Woke up in the mornin, can't remember what we did
Last night we was drunk, stinkin dirty motherfuckers
Stayed up all night, till 7:30 can't touch us
When we down on the beach, in the sand in Miami
I done found me a freak, done got my hand in her panties
She was playin' in the water, MAN she was wet
So I laid her on her back, I pulled her panties to the left
I told her... naww baby, we ain't do it too soon
Straighten up your dress, let's go up to my room
Tell your man you was lost, ran into a boss
Then I opened that ass up like a can of sauce
We don't like those lollypops
Sucker ass niggaz don't know how we rock
They can't even handle it
When you tell the truth, they can't stand a bitch
We don't like those lame marks
That run the other way when the game starts
'Cause they don't know what to do
Don't lie tell me why would I fuck with you
Stop hatin' since we datin the same lady
Don't hate the player, hate the game baby
I like her style, she's kinda wild
And when we do it we don't waste time goin' out
We into it like the X-Rated flick with no plot, it's so hot
Don't hesitate and don't stop till we on top
She got a dude - but what I gotta prove?
Ain't no need to creep, you know she's a freak
Take it all, till the balls, disappear in her jaws
Then she take off them drawers, let me hit them sugar walls
And when I'm done havin' fun tryin' to be a player
She kiss my thang goodbye and say I'll see you later
Now if you can't take it mayne you need a good girl
Take a ride around the town and try to look for her
Cause yo' wife's a hoe, you might like to know
If she see a big dick, she might go...
We don't like those lollypops
Sucker ass niggaz don't know how we rock
They can't even handle it
When you tell the truth, they can't stand a bitch
We don't like those lame marks
That run the other way when the game starts
'Cause they don't know what to do
Don't lie tell me why would I fuck with you
I watched her eye, she witcha man, stop starin'
Stop the lies, there's no comparin
You wanna ride well let's go; I got a magic carpet with vogues
I'm nice to the ladies but I'm hard on the hoes
And when you jump in my car bumpin ""Freaky Tales""
You told me pull it out, you wanna see it's real
I know your type girl, you ain't fin' to wait
That's how a pimp taste ridin' on the interstate
It's in your mouth, make you wanna scream and shout
You can swallow or spit, when the cream comes out - bitch!
Just don't tell your man
Cause whores start wars when they know they can
I understand, you really wanna do me
Dance to a slow jam, ""Feelin' on Your Booty""
And after tonight, when you kick it with a real one
All them fake-ass niggaz you ain't even gon' feel 'em (hell nah)
We don't like those lollypops
Sucker ass niggaz don't know how we rock
They can't even handle it
When you tell the truth, they can't stand a bitch
We don't like those lame marks
That run the other way when the game starts
'Cause they don't know what to do
Don't lie tell me why would I fuck with you"

Been in the game for 20 minutes, and they thinkin' they legends
All on their videos showin off, frontin for the camera
One-hit wonders is playin' games, fakin stamina
I damage ya, throwin' blows to your egos
Flossin new leather, think you the shit wearin these clothes
And supposed to flash and have the finer things
But can't seem to keep your money, 'cause you're buyin rings
What is you gettin', 7 or 6, new record contract?
Bustin' your bomb raps, but you ain't gettin' your funds back
Fuck that, I been around since '86
Way before my muthafuckin mind played tricks
And when Too $hort told me this bitch, it wasn't givin'
'Cause I'm sick and tired of niggas fantasizin they livin'
All on the tell-lie-vision tryina front like that's your car
With a fat-ass cigar, you ain't no muthafuckin star
What you are is a nigga lost, dazed and confused
Back in the day that you stepped in it is the day that you do
But on the cool, some niggas been around since the '70s
Steadily preachin to us all longevity

Fuck that bullshit you niggas be on in your videos
Drive the shit your C.E.O. own
In their home, at their parties, you niggas dummies
Muthafucka, fuck the fame, it's all about the money
And then the power (money and the power)
Slingin tapes like powder
Everything I own is mine, don't understand 'ours'
This's a serious business
My nigga, take care of your business
Especially you niggas with gimmicks, your ass is finished
In the nick of time, fuck havin' the tightest rhymes
You better grind, it's plenty fools dope without a dime
So I'm tight with mines, and I prove that every time
Just to let you niggas know I'm out to get mine

Rappers blow up, fall off, and think
Been there, done that, about to make a comeback
I'm on some new shit, not like my young raps
I know what you sold, first album went gold
Then you changed the style, shoulda stuck with the old
Flows, and the old clothes, cause now you fake
You ain't got no hoes committin foul play
Hatin' on me, but you're waitin to see
Old school Too $hort in the place to be
I ain't backstage chasin young girlies
I'm chasin money, I'm in my early 30s
Still sellin records, and I'm still a real player

Said I don't stop rappin' from the start

Whassup baby? Still dreamin'?
For a rich man, you still fiendin?
Well I hope he got skills if you know what I mean
Everything from oral sex, to cookin and cleanin
Rich niggaz want it all, just like you
And when I ball don't ask me what I do
You wanna be kept, keep yo' mouth shut
But youse a golddigger and you go out too much
If I choose you, it'll be the wrong choice
I'm sayin' fuck you loud, with a strong voice
One rainy day and yo' ass is out
No money to spend, you start passin out
So dramatic, even though it ain't yo' cash
Bitches like you I wanna thank yo' ass
For bein shallow, I know you a bad ho
I wouldn't let yo' punk-ass stand next to my shadow

But he still stuck his dick in yo' mouth bitch
And after all that gettin' fucked on the floor
He called a taxi to take you home in the mornin
Dumb bitch, you just got fucked by a flunkie
See you at the club and you actin' like you want ME
Don't make me laugh
We get married, and you take half

Hope you come back, but you just cain't stay
We can get together on another day
I come get you, when I miss you
'Cause if I see you every day I'd probably diss you
What'chu gon' do when you get you a baller?
Rich man, what she gotta do to get you to call her?
Better talk about, might like what you hear
Say it right in her ear, every night of the year
You can be together, beotch!

Go to school or somethin', get a degree

134,Mack Attack,1987,Born to Mack (1987),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"It's a mack attack, coming from way back
My name is too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
I'm from the dangerous crew, and I tell you it's true
Everything they say about playboy too
I'm $hort dog, ain't nothing nice
I drink g-juice and wouldn't cut it with ice
>From the eastside baby, oakland town
Can't understand why I'm so down?
I'm not a whitewall, I'm a vogue
Like a zenith wire wheel I roll
Got a fresh new beat, made to get freak
It was everything you wanted 'cause I can't be weak
Yeah baby that's it, do the split
Freak nasty all on my tip
I took it to my DJ fresh on wax
Put it on the turntable, I got taps
It started burning up, wires smoking
Had to be the sound coming straight from oakland
$Hort dog, it's a mack attack
My name is too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
One young tender lost all hope
Slapped her in the face with my dunkey rope
Another young sucker tried to front my staff
Saw it on his face when they broke him in half
It was the dangerous crew, and I tell you it's true
Everything they say about playboy too
When I say my rhymes, I'm never fake
When you start my beat, that's when I break
On you, and it don't stop, and it don't stop, and it won't stop
'Cause I'm too $hort baby on the microphone and I'm macking
I'm not a wannabe pimp, I never simp
Since I started walking I had this limp
It was a cool type walk, just like me
The too s-h-o-r-t
I might be young, but I spit this game
I start it with p, and it ends the same
If your brain is lame, remember the name
When it's too $hort baby, ain't nothing plain
Dangerous music on the microphone
Makes you wanna break your hip bone
Might break your leg, or maybe your back
Grooving to hard to my mack attack
It's really not easy, you know it's hard
Sort of just like my gangster car
You know what I mean, vern? it's like funny
I mack legit and make all the money
See my capital t on my diamond ring
We hook up the beat and love to swing
So while you're out there grooving back and forth
I want you to scream out sir too $hort (sir too $hort!)
Don't stop that rap (don't stop that rap!)
And it's just like that
Get buy girls, while I rap
I make big money, that ain't no crap
When I grab that mic, and spit my rhymes
I gotta have an 8 or 909 beat
So I can rock you all night long, she's
On my tip, she love my song, he
Tried to do it but did it wrong, freaks
Want to get my all alone, but I'm macking
I finally got a chance to grab my pen
And make another rhyme so I can make more ends
It's a rush production, not the beat
I rushed it out the studio and hit the street
Now I'm rocking one more time
Young girls love my too $hort rhyme
But that big fat girl better let that go
Before I point right at her say ho!
I'm riding drop-top caddy, I don't dip fake
I step on the gas then I hit the break
Do it again as I catch the beat
You're feeling that bass all down the street
Jumped out the car on 9-0
I was wearing all white capezio
Had my 501's, five dunkey ropes
Couldn't be saved by john the pope
The m, a, c and k, from oakland, California
I'm too $hort baby, no I don't play, I'm macking
Freak nasty, I like your dance
You know it looks good in those pants
So damn good, I had to glance
Now I'm macking
See this gold? I bought it all
Now every night you young freaks call
You see my car? it's my best friend
So it you touch, you'll meet your end
Time will tell, just keep it cool
Don't play that game, don't be no fool
I'll burn rubber all down your block
You know what I want so keep the door unlocked
I'm coming in baby, don't waste no time
It's a mack attack, and now you're mine
Dangerous music is what it seems
The reason this floor just met those jeans
I was running the game all in your ear
You're talking bout love to a stone cold player
Girl look good and wanna have that sex
Took another look and wanted to break that neck
It's a mack attack, coming from way back
My name is too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
I'm from the dangerous crew, and I know it's true
The only thing you'll say about playboy too
Is I'm macking"

Ten years ago, you was havin' thangs
Now you ain't nuttin but a maggot brain
Used to be on the block gettin' at 'em mayne
Back in the days when you was slangin 'caine
Now you fresh out of jail, just comin' home
Livin' at your momma's house, nuttin goin' on
Cain't hustle, and you cain't fit in
Hit the corner, but you ain't makin' friends
Yo' life, just twist and turns
Out on parole, now he fin'sta learn
If you sleep too late you cain't get the worm
You cain't smoke weed cause ain't shit to burn
That's where you at, and ain't no way back
These lil' niggaz on the block stay strapped
Fuck that~! Convicted felon with a gat?
It's mandatory; you get caught you goin' back
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
You gettin' off doin' nothin'
Get your mind right ya, need to do somethin'
Spend all day smokin' blunts
You maggot brain, get yo' mind right and so somethin'

You barely pay your rent; spend all day on the phone
You're always lyin', yo' excuses be irrelevant
You let 'em hit and use yo' food stamps to feed his friends
Always yellin', always beggin somebody to babysit
Hell, you're always in barely everything
Always causin problems, always with it, barely know his name
Youse a trainwreck, think we can't see through that?
Get ya mind right, youse a burnt out turfin rat
You barely in your house, it always smell like piss
You only scrapin when company comes over
Then you jumpin' in the shower, snitchin and ya gossipin
Ain't nobody like you, so you wonder why she not ya friend
Silk, it's Silk E not cotton blend
Authentic not rented official game spitter
Fight over yo' baby daddy {?} fuck with her
Always talkin' shit, always on my nerves, youse a maggot brain

She don't wanna be wit'chu - why would she?
Video games, blunts and pussy?
That's all you want, cause you have no goals
Stayin at your momma's house, is so old
You need to reinvent yo'self right now
You need a makeover, a new lifestyle
Some new clothes, a new place to live
Go get yo' baby momma and take yo' kids
Stop doin' crime, and stay out of court
Cause you know you ain't never paid child support
And if you get a job, they take it out yo' check
Can't get a driver's license, now you really 'bout to quit

And ride around to the liquor store
Can't get a job get drunk some more
You better stop trippin' on them stereotypes
'Cause In The Ghetto there's a good life
We ain't starvin' like marvin' won't see no roach
When you chill wit the rich folks in the hood
You sittin' on leather watchin' big screens
Bought by the dope fiends
Smokin' and what about the brother wit the good jobs
Save money and workin' hard
Bought a house for his wife and kids
You only got 1 life to live
Another brother got some cocaine
You know his face but don't know his name
You know he got the sack man
And he's sittin' on a phat bank
Sellin' cars at his house in the driveway

And all the players that came before him.
If you a everyday hustler, get'cha money
'Cause what they do to black man ain't funny
All the time tryin' to put us the pen
You get parole and then they send you again
All the homies in the hood gettin' paid
You might have left but the Money stayed
In The Ghetto it ain't all about drugs
Gettin' paid doin' all kind of stuff
Only rule on the street is don't get caught
Unless you hustle ain't breakin' the law
And even though rich folks got it good
We're sittin' on it phat in the hood

On a $1 bill if you look on the front
You find the face of George Washington
Make money baby that's all I do
That's how I know Thomas Jefferson is on the 2
Abraham Lincoln got shot and died
Freed the slaves so they put him on the 5
And how much in my old time friend
They put his face on the front of the 10
They are the dead presidents
From the hood and they represent
The American dream for the average monority
Makin' money get some weed & a 40

139,More Freaky Tales,1999,Can't Stay Away (1999),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Beyotch!
Short Dog's in the house, once again with this pimp shit
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah
I met this girl in Atlanta
She let a nigga fuck but I still can't stand her
The pussy wasn't good I said ""What's up bitch?
I'm tired of fuckin' can you suck dick?""
She said ""No"", but she had another friend
So I switched like a real pimp
Laying on my back with my dick in her mouth
I said ""Beyotch! What you talkin' 'bout?""
She mumbled something, I don't know what she said
Smoking on a joint gettin' some bomb-ass head
Bitch said her name was Theresa
All on my dick like cheese on pizza
In the A-T-L where the grass is greener
I fucked Nina, Melina, Sabrina and Tina
When I first moved out there, I met Holly
Five-foot one with a bad ass body
Freaky little bitch she was a Gemini
She used to stand up and say ""Shoot it in my eye!""
I met another girl went to Spellman College
Every day after school I acquired the knowledge
I took her to my house so I could get some
I fucked her real good and made the bitch cum
She was hella limber, said her name was Amber
She wouldn't stop screaming, that's all I remember
I had another freak, her name was Wendy
When I first met the bitch she said ""Please don't pimp me!""
I did it anyway
I'm coming straight from Oakland, C-A
Ain't no other way, like my girl Shante
She lives in Atlanta, but she comes from the Bay
Let me hit that hometown pussy on the strimp
Look out for a nigga, treat me like a pimp
You know I can't forget about the strippers
Cinderella with the glass slipper
Top down in the Benz ain't spendin' no ends
Fat bag of indo, bring all your friends
It's like Lotto, you get a quick pick
Bitches said they heard I had a big dick
So I showed it to 'em, only took one second
Dick rock hard, bitches gettin' nekked
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah
I know another bitch, her name is Terri
I lied to the bitch ""It's about time I get married""
I couldn't see me pimpin' her
So I fucked her next door neighbor, Jennifer
She had two roommates, Cindy and Amy
Terri caught me creepin' and said ""Nigga don't play me!""
But them hoes liked to freak
I used to send 'em new niggas every other week
I never would tell you all the hoes I fucked
These are the tales, some of this shit I made up
I change the name so I can rhyme and shit
So if it's you, you know the time bitch!
I spent the night with Monique in between the sheets
It was her, her girlfriend April and me
I do it on the regular, two at a time
Call it what you want I be a fool wit' mine
Like them Texas niggas, I never would change
Like my niggas up in Cleveland spit the good game
These hoes recognize when I come in the door
I ain't trickin bitch, so what you want me for?
Like Natalie, swearin' up and down I had to be the one
Bitch lets have some fun
I fucked her, you thought I didn't
Short Dog's in the house and I keep on pimpin'
So then I fucked the twins, Sharon and Karen
Went straight for the panties, but they wasn't wearin 'em
Don't ask me who I fucked first, it ain't my fault
In the end, I still got the same results
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah
Hell yeah, I never would forget Charlene
We was layin real close like two sardines
Talkin', laughin', kissin' and shit
Next thing I know she started kissin' my dick
You know the rest, before she left I paged Mia
I told her ""I got a new freak over here""
She rushed over, I left and when I came back
Them hoes was lickin' cats
They call me ""Short"" when I'm pimpin', ""Dog"" when I'm mackin'
Gotta get the money, that's all that's happenin'
She wants to be my love slave, I need some bug spray
To keep these hoes away
I never would tell you all the hoes I fucked
These are the tales, some of this shit I made up
I change the name so I can rhyme and shit
So if it's you, you know the time bitch!

143,Never Talk Down,1996,Gettin' It (Album Number Ten) (1996),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"You see you never talk down on a playa, I'll spray ya
Then break it down to your knee, you best to say a prayer
This funk been a part of my life ever since the startin' gate
Remember me and my nigga $hort Dog way back in '88?
Broke them bitches down with some sexual healing
And man the town ain't been the same since ""Don't Fight the Feelin'""
But now your new booty, stayed off in this game on a accident
Copied another niggaz style
Punk don't let this rap shit get you broke off
Cause see it's potent like that ain't right
Find a maiden name for yourself, but don't believe the hype
Fool, who you think opened the door for your producer?
If it wasn't for the Dog and them hogg's you wouldn't have a future
And let me add that I could never be scared of ya
Rappin' 4', born and raised off in that Bay Area
Stickin' to that ass like a hot bowl of grits
Hits on top of hits, who you think started this shit?
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog
Got you fiendin' with this funk, nigga
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a 'what?'

Somethin' for my niggaz on the grind from the West
Cali is my home but its just like yours
Niggaz love to get money while they fuck they whores
Hit all the parties, and do the same old shit
Bitches gettin' broke 'cause the game don't quit
I had a flashback, it was the Oakland Raiders at the Coliseum
We ain't nothin' but players - diamonds glistenin', hoes whistlin'
Bitches know my name 'cause it's a natural thang
I had to bend a corner, really didn't wanna - punk you's a goner
Heard you was on a - stick up mission, triple-beam in the kitchen
Never shot nobody but I'm damn sure itchin' to blast you
Cause in your dream you shot me
Then you woke up and found out you can't stop me
You see you never talk down on a playa
Unless you're ready to be straight labeled as a hater
Save a - bitch in a minute for a nut
It's the 4' and the Dog

Got you fiendin' on this funk, beotch
If buckin' a motherfucker on the mic be a crime
Best believe the police got a APB out on mine
Because I gots more disguises than that fool Inspector Gadget
I'm not a witch, but crystal ball let me have it, ah
I seen playa hatin' way back from the gate
Now everybody wanna be a P-L-A-Y-A
Why lie to yourself and play the role as a simp?
Knowin' damn well your bitch bought ""Shorty the Pimp""
Because they smile in your face
And all the while them motherfuckers wanna take your place
That's right 4', we from the old school
Been doin' shows, been comin' tight in studios
Songs on the radio, interviews, and laughs
Up at the mall signin' autographs
And ain't nothin' gon' change in '96
Cause this pimp gotta mack all the finest bitches
And get paid from the game
So they never talk down on a playa's name
You never talk down on a playa

Over all I balls more and none test
I keep a gun and I put two off in a niggaz chest
And see coincide within the same heartbeat

144,No Love from Oakland,1992,Shorty the Pimp  (1992),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Ain't no love in oakland, bitch
Niggas always talkin' bout 'i love you'
But ain't no love, bitch
Now it's a shame, I can't be saved by john the pope
I gotta be a pimp or sellin dope
Cause in this town, it's goin' on
And brothers doin' that can't live too long
So what's my option, do it or not
Break a hoe, sell a ki, just don't get caught
'Cause if I do, I'm goin' to jail
On a one-way ticket to a prison cell
So why commit the crime? don't ask me
Went to school everyday, and I still can't read
I count money like a champ, now ask me
Why everyday does the task force jack me
The story's been told one million times
About a boy growin' up to a life of crime
I heard it before, you heard it too
But now, homeboy, it's just me and you
You see, people try to call us filthy trash
Even though we live better and make mo' cash
Than they do, I'm not a no-good thug
Standin on the corner sellin drugs
And just remember, this ain't multiple choice
Without a college degree you only got your voice
You gotta talk for yours, or get nothin' at all
This ain't the nba, I ain't havin' a ball
Every day is a trip, but I ain't trippin'
Watch my back and don't start slippin
Money won't talk, but it looks right back
Everytime I dip into my stack
I'm buyin cars, jewelries, and mobile phones
Things I couldn't get with a high school diploma
It's all right, 'cause I just help myself
You should know, 'cause I can't do nothin' else
And you better watch out for the day
When you lock me up and throw that key away
'Cause I'll be back on parole
Ain't changed nothing, 'cause I'm ready to roll
I go to school now, but just to front
Still servin' dopefiends what they want
Count 5 to 10, 10 to 20
And I just keep on makin' money
I hope you don't think my story's amazin
I tell it to a kid in the ghetto, it won't faze him
So many blackmen die for drugs
I think back on the way life was
Before rock cocaine started runnin' thangs
And drive-by shootings was a normal thang
Before brothers bought benzes, used to drive mustangs
12 years later, and I'm still in the game
All my life all I wanted was a few hoes
If I was pimpin' or slingin at the liquor sto'
Ain't nothin' but street life, fuck that school
All the squares up there ain't even cool
Plus my partners at the house sell coke all day
Hit the mall like players, spendin fat-ass bank
Junior high wasn't shit but a place to fight
Muthafuckas wasn't learnin how to read and write
I'm just walkin' down the street all alone
High as hell, my mind is gone
I'm thinkin' bout some brand-new shit and I'm broke
I know I be a fiend if I smoke that coke
But if I go back to school and get educated
Be a old-ass man before I graduated
So what should I do, I can't even cope
I guess I'll get a sack and start slingin dope
I went to my homie, said, give me the sack
He disappeared quick, and he came right back
He said, you owe me a g, I give you a week
You fuck up my money, don't cop no plead
Cause in the oak ain't no love, $hort
I knew right then I couldn't sell that coke
When I was young, it was hard to tell
If I grow up and be rich as hell
See, I was cool I knew all the shit
Big bank on my finger tips
But I never had a big bank, not back then
I kicked back and watched all my friends
Make big money, right in my face
And if you ever crossed them, they be on your case
You go under, six feet underground
You gets no love from the oaktown
I drive my top everyday like a movie star
Drive around all night in old towed up cars
And if you stop me, ain't no tellin' what you find in my trunk
Gotta live like this, 'cause I ain't no punk
So break down the dank and roll up that shit
Light the muthafucka, take a fat-ass hit
My fingers all sticky from the residue
Don't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
Cause life is only give and take
In the town where the strong control the fake
The wild wild west, that's the place
Suckers take a bite, and don't even taste
The California lifestyle that I live
Mack these hoes every chance I get
Like a drop sl, three times black
I'm a pimp, a player and I been known to mack
I'm a muthafucka, I broke your heart
She gave it all to me, and I tore it apart
Talked about love right to the end
But I broke your heart and, bitch, I do it again
So young and tender, also fine
Tryin' to get short dog all the time
I take what I want, you can keep the rest
You gets no love from east oakland, bitch
That's the place I call home
Where the oakland city players roam
Game don't stop, listen to me
Everybody fuckin' with the o.p.d.
Slingin cocaine, knockin' it off
Killed some nigga, and he never got caught
High-speed chases everyday
Can't make no money no other way
A bitch yelled raid!, that ain't true
Cause you laid down, and she fucked you
Two days ago I didn't know she existed
But now baby is just one of my bitches
I don't care what you say
'Cause I catch bitches and straight get pay
You don't care what I'm sayin'
Punk-ass square ain't got no game
Hoes love me, 'cause I'm a player
They think maybe I just might fuck 'em later
I keep mackin though, I don't work for free
To be a true hoe you gotta pay me
I spend endless days and endless nights
Plottin this shit to keep my money right
I build stages in my mind, and it's all an act
All I'm tryin' to do is keep my pockets fat
With this pimp game, and these funky beats
Now here's a little story from the oakland streets
You see, tania had a boyfriend, his name was jack
Always had the bitches on their backs
Jack told tania, I love you so
But jack's a mack, he's got several hoes
One day she beeped him to say what's up
He didn't call back, 'cause she was only out to fuck
She beeped mike, 'cause she got mad
She knew about the bitches her boyfriend had
Mike called back, and he was on his way
He just got the pussy yesterday
You see, mike ain't trippin' on his girlfriend
Fine little bitch, I think her name is lynn
Mike paid the bills always in cash
And if she ever got raw, he just beat that ass
It goes on y'all, so don't even trip
You gets no love from east oakland, bitch
Got sprung, even though it's not legal
A young black man livin' like rich people
I got this game from a hard-ass place
It's on the map, right there in your face
I see my people, all filled with joy
Next day they're killin' homeboys
Can't say shit if you sho' can't shoot
Cause muthafuckas will smoke them boots
You gets no love from oakland, bitch
You better try to make me rich"

So get on it. now is the time
Too $hort, baby, s gonna spit that rhyme
At you, 'cause I'm jammin, so check me
I play the music, even made the beat
'Cause I'm the most rappin', most rhymin
Rollin' in a drop-top straight high-sidin
On you, boy, I'm poppin' the most
I come from oakland, don't play me close
'Cause I'm a player, love to play this game
I get funky out here, pumpin the name
Too $hort, the one and only, I just rock it
Fat bankrolls in my pocket
Call me the dirty rapper, Ill say, sure
But I'm a young black entrepreneur
I'm an MC, right? I own a company too
Programmed the drums and made the groove
So when you look in my face you see a wealthy man
I hope it's not hard for you to understand
I'm the businessman, it's not the same

Can I get busy, are my raps too weak?
Boy, you're too grown, don't say I'm borin
Just because you know I come from californ-
Ia where many rappers get no respect
I'm at home in a tape deck
I get played and played until it's all played out
Sucker mcs come to my house
They want a contract, get signed up
But like toys they need a good wind-up
Then the other suckers, sayin' no names
Rap on the mic and use new york slang
Even though we don't talk like that out here
The point I'm tryina make comes out so clear
You want paper or plastic, visa or cash?
You wanna burn rubber, gonna step on the gas
Now nip, dip, roll the strip
Gonna take your mind on a serious tip
Like always I made the beat funky
I keep your head bouncin' like a dopefiend junkie
I got to say it before I break
I never rap fake
'Cause I'm
Too $hort
See, I'm fresh like always, no sweat
Its time to jump back in the mix and get
On it, now is the time
Too $hort, baby, s gonna spit that rhyme
I sell records everyday
And still I get no radio play
I got homies, they love my beat
So you hear me all over the streets
A tape rhymes with bass, I make it deep
The kinda tape you'll always keep
So if you lose it, you're not my mamas son
It ain't free, go and buy another one
Like a costume party on halloween
Mcs pop up on the scene
So you made a record, I saw your poster
I'm still harder than you, boy, look closer
Wont say whos best, I just tell you the truth
You're not makin' money, so it couldn't be you
So if that leaves me, too $hort, baby
I keep it in tune like do-re-mi
With a strict rap tempo, bassline simple
Take that, it's a too $hort rap
Its on you, boy, I'm poppin' the most
I come from oakland, don't play me close
'Cause I'm
Too $hort
Nobody does it better
Tell you, nobody does it better than too $hort
I take a limousine to the airport
Fly first class, never ever last
Cause a brother like me, I pay cash
Twinkle, twinkle, star in the night
Don't look now, but I'm shinin bright
I know you wanna hear my triple x
Foul language, girls and sex
Well, I'm gonna tell you bout livin' the life
Stayin in school and not smokin' the pipe
Its hard to be a rich man, don't you know?
When you drop out of school and start smokin' dope
It goes d-u-m-b
You're lookin' for some d?
Then start tweakin, its goin' on
You don't like it? well, play another song
I got rhymes, you wanna hear?
I sing 'em every day of the year
You try to get it, you think you got it
I hope you like it, cause you sure can't stop it
This rap is so funky fresh
Too $hort, baby, in the flesh
And if you ever say I'm through
So what? I'm makin' more than you
'Cause I'm
Too $hort"

Aw, they sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we do it like this
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we're doin' it, oh
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
I know you like it when I cometo your house
You like it in the car, you like it on the couch
You like to lay me on my back and rub on my chest
You do me up like the best and then you want the rest
You make me feel like I'll never know a better friend
I hope you never stop, I hope it never ends
I must be tastin' somethin' like your favorite flavor
Can you do it again? You said maybe later
Baby, wait a little while, you said your jaws was hurtin'
So I turned out the lights and closed all the curtains
But when you closed your eyes I put it all on your cheek
'Cause I'm wide awake and can't fall asleep, now kiss it
Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we do it like this
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we're doin' it, oh
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Yeah, I'm one of those rappers, I reap the benefits
I'll dated a Too $hort fan, a cute freaky lil' chick
I used to go to L.A. and have fun with Super Head
When you was just a kid gettin' sent straight to bed
You used to get whoopers when ya bought my beat
But now she's all grown up and she's wantin' me
The way you take it out
I bet you won a gold medal at the Kiss Olympics now
I just spit the pimpin', I like the thick women
I like the slim goodies and the real big women
But I just love the way you do it, it's original
I feel like a pimp, player, mack, daddy, gigolo, damn
Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we do it like this
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we're doin' it, oh
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Remember Tina? Tina, the cleaner?
I had a good time last time I seen her
Old School Betty and Deepthroat Dana
You're always so ready, I'm c***
Right now, this is just wonderful
I can't tell, it's like you havin' more fun than $hort
It's better than two women at the same time
Or even ten dime-pieces, waitin' in line
Takin' turns, while they s*** on each others spit
Want a playa with some game to bust on her upper lip
Massagin' her tongue, while I tickle her tonsils
It's no doubt though, I get b***, yo
Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we do it like this
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Nothin' in the world make a playa feel better
Than when we're doin' it, oh
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good
Touch it right there, ooh, it feel good"

It's all good so just make me rich
And get in where you fit in, bitch
Well, I get high cause that's what I do
What about you? tell me is it true?
I heard you was through, your ass went broke
Jewerly got pawned and your cars got sold
But on the long run you got nothin' to prove

You gotta get right in where you belong

Loud mouth bitches who talk too much
Dick teasin bitches who never fuck
Sucka ass nigga fake as hell
A man or a bitch I really can't tell
Some of you niggas need to quit
Show and tell nigga you ain't shit
Sayin' I got this and I got that
But when it comes to you I got no rap
'Cause what I see is good for me
And what I don't know just let it be
Bitches gamin workin extensions
Her hair ain't really but two inches
Bald head girls in the Oakland world
Short afros and jheri curls
Nappy head niggas like myself
Get a bald head and say go to hell
But you're a snake you're a worm
Bald head bitch you need a perm
Oakland California is the city of liars
Fresh barbed wires with vogue tires
Niggas tellin' stories twenty minutes long
And everything in it was smooth wrong
I said why you wanna tell me I don't wanna know
All I want is stereo rock
Homeboys kick it gettin' keyed
Sold that mark some fake weed
Told that nigga here you go
A big fat sack and you know it's premo
A 20-dollar bill went to your hand
You rushed that money to the coke man
To the coke bottle was the next stop
But you broke the bottle and can't smoke rock
Bass rocks bass rocks that's your daddy
You better off smokin' on a powdered cabby
Have a white christmas everyday
Cause coke can cabby is a too short way
That's too s-h-o-r-t
Smoke more coke than Richard P
Have more money than 
Oakland can I get some action
Hey young tender in the 501's
I love to see when you work your tongue
Suckin my dick in the back of the car
Rollin' down skyline boulevard
I said beeeeeeeyach
What are you smokin'
A big fat dick in the big east Oakland
I seen my homey he needs to quit
Holdin' hands with a bitch who looks like shit
Maybe I'm wrong by what I say
Maybe that nigga is gettin' paid
Maybe that ain't bein used
Gettin' fucked without collectin dues
That's how I work all the time
I'm too short baby got a fresh new rhyme
For Oakland, California that's the place
Homies got drugs all in yo face
With the opd cruise down again
Niggas goin' half off dubes and tens
On any corner anywhere
Buy your drugs from a Oakland player
Niggas sell squat callin it top
Cut cocaine get a big nigga rock
Crime went down murder went up
And some of these turfs are tryin' to get tuff
Whos the leader of the hour
Anybody livin' if they push power
M-16, 357
Sendin these niggas to hell not heaven
So much death in the Oakland streets
Your nothin' but a target sellin weed
You know I'm rappin' the honest truth
Niggas roll up shotin guns at you
Frettin your life and call you fake
Till you take your drugs to another state
And sometimes man it's a pitty
Cause a nigga used to roll in the Oakland city
Niggas who take do you know yourself
You must be the nigga with all the wealth
Maybe one day you can own this town
If everybody fucked and you are down
That's how you see it I do too
But I break bitches and you break crew
Oakland California is gettin' tuff

Niggas got ways to make big bank
Hit these streets like an army tank

I'm a put cocaine all over my dick
And tell that bitch it's time to lick
East Oakland that's where I live
The city of the freak freak freaky bitch
I spent the night with her she ain't mine
I fuck that bitch so many times
And that right there I could never fake
I thought my god dam dick would break
Fuckin' too much makes you hurt
But I never stuck a bitch from putin in work
All you bitches can suck me dry
Suckin my dick for the rest of your lives

Niggas from Oakland young and old
Runin round here keep off that dope
Singin' my rap at the skating rink
Sucka MC do you know what I think
You wanna be me so dam bad
You wish that you could make my rap
When I say short you say your name
Tellin' your homies you rappin' game
But I sell tapes and niggas know
You singin' my rap in stereo
Some of you niggas ain't really shit
And Tony G. is just a bitch
Why does Tony rap like me
'Cause he ain't no pass high?
Just sleep to the world on what I do

Old school... I'm from the old school
Old school... I'm from the old school
I came in the door as the story goes
Looked around the room all I seen was hoes
It's like a pussy supermarket; let's go shoppin'
Packed like sardines, clubs straight poppin'
Fuck the V.I.P. section
I'm bout to hit the pharmacy, and get my head connected
Get me some protection
Walk around and see who I wanna have sex with
The usual - a nice high-yellow cutie
Or maybe tonight, I might find a black beauty
With a big ol' booty, no doubt
We'll have a few drinks and then roll out
I can't do the ""Jungle Fever""
'Cause it's too many black hoes here that might see ya
If I peep a white broad with some ass and lips
Fine as hell - I'ma have to ask the bitch some'in
'Cause I might end up fuckin'
I don't care what you say, I don't owe you hoes nothin'
I fuck tall bitches, even fuck small bitches
Too bad I can't fuck all you bitches
It don't take players like me too long
To get bitches like you to let me take you home
I got the game from Oakland, California
I'm Short Dawg, I hope your momma warned ya
'Bout the old school... do the old school
I'm from the old school... do the old school
I'm always hustlin, always workin hard
If you tryin' to get the money I'ma do my part
On the weekends, we like to celebrate
Cash checks ride away can't wait
Fuck crime - I'm bustin' Too $hort rhymes
Unless it's bout millions I ain't tryin' to do time
It's like everyday is Saturday
So many bitches let me have my way
You can analyze it, all you want
But I was knockin' bad hoes with no teeth in the front
When I had no money and drove my momma's car
I had bad-ass bitches look like superstars
It's the game, old as it may be
It makes fine-ass hoes call me baby
I look down and think, this that fuckin' shit
Seein this beautiful bitch, she just suckin my dick
Too many times in a player's wife
We always have to hear what you squares feel like
Fuck that; do what you gotta do
I see you creepin' through the hood buyin prostitutes
I know I'm fuckin' hoes, and gettin' high
You wanna criticize me but you livin' a lie
With yo' suit and tie, and yo' love for hoes
You ain't shit motherfucker and Short Dawg knows
I'm from the old school... do the old school
Do the old school... I'm from the old school
Don't cross the game they'll take yo' life
Respect the game and you can play all night
If you snitchin, don't get caught slippin
If you blood'n or crip'n, other niggaz set-trippin'
Watch yo' back, it don't take a brainiac
We got a lot of homocidal maniacs in the streets
Sometimes life is terrible
Y'all say goodbye, niggaz say be careful
Back in the day they woulda killed yo' ass
For a reason, they might even keep you breathin
Fuck your whole world up, you can't get down
Broke livin' on the streets and you can't skip town
But ain't no slow deaths in the triple-oh
If you fuckin' up then you get to go
Somebody gon' hold you down
So you can't get up off that cold ground
Lights flashin, and you keep passin out
You know you fucked up with your bad-ass mouth
Once upon a time they woulda knocked you out
Maybe back in ninety-nine, but not in 2000
Anybody wanna do it like the old school?
Hella niggaz at the park with no shootin
Sunday afternoon, at the park
Niggaz leanin hella hard goin' by in the car

My name is short that's a fake because I rap so long
Other rappers hear pop I put funk in this song
Young tender on the floor wiggle it all
Homeboy keeps telling her to give him a call
He's been on her since 10 and it's almost 2
Walking through the party with his dick on the roof
Tryin' to catch a little freak in the mini skirt
She can dance real nasty all the boys like her
You can handle like a dog but you won't get game
You'll only get dog fake number and name
She's a mother to be and you better believe
You'll be looking at her mean next time you meet
Young tender won't care she's still fine here
You come again with your playboy line you don't stop
The party start jumping 5 hours ago
The mix don't stop till it's way past 4
At 3 A.M. I hit the scene
Buck-toothed freaks hit 3:15
Pull out with one ditch the other
I jumped in my ride and I burnt rubber
Party time, get busy, Too Short
She's the one, love those legs danced to rockers
But it seems like days
Baby so fine I keep telling myself
I want the young tender under my love spell
She could be all mine, nothing more or less
Life with a smile never, ever depressed
I give her ever lasting love around the clock
Baby doll it's you and me so just rock
Breakdown, all you superficial rappers will cease to exist
If I come into a party hitting' raps like this
Though I make you feel weak when you want to be strong
You're soft so buddy as I statin' my song
According to the scriptures in the book of rhymes
Biting on a line is considered a crime unintelligent?
Yes, never fresh, Run DMC tattooed on ya chest
I'll tell ya one time and one time only
You might be fresh if you weren't so phoney
The ability to rap is a gift from God if you biting
Where you writing and it won't be bought
At the spur of a moment I will bust a rap
Simultaneously jammin' with the beat in the back
Party time, get busy, party time
Party time so get busy
Shake it, bake it, make it, break it
Work that body girl just don't fake it
I'm the kinda brotha for a girl like you
I can see in yo eyes that you know it's true
I'm the mack and I bike from the big oak town
Layin' track by track that vicious sound
All you sucka emcee's hatin' my face
Even though there's not a rapper that could take my place
You better hunt, look, or just get took
I know what you about see, I read you like a book
Desperate dreams are on your mind with a 10 foot mic
You couldn't touch my rhymes
I don't stop rappin' don't stop cappin'
Give me some time and you see what happens
Party time, get busy
So fresh to the sound
I get down I'm so fresh from the Oakland town"

Half past ten I heard the phone ring
When I picked it up, I said ""Hello?""
The bitch spoke up and said ""What's up ho?""
I said, ""Bitch, if you're fine it's my dick""
Enough playing, who the fuck is this?
She said ""Janet"" I said ""Oh""
Met the bitch last week at my show
I told her ""Call me"" and I gave her my card
She talked dirty and my dick got hard
That night I fucked the bitch three times straight
Next night we made another date
I gave a concert and she came backstage
Fuck a bitch, I'm trying to get paid
But that puusy squeezed tighter than a vice grip
Fucked around and met this other bitch
Right out the back I told her ""Bitch let's go""
Took the bitch to my limo even though
Her friend said I'm ugly, I ain't even fresh
She told her friend they fuck the best
Rushed the bitch to the back seat
She pulled up her skirt and fucked the shit out of me
She said her name was Paula, bitch turned me out
Took my dick out the pussy, let me cum in her mouth
She kept sucking like a veteran, I couldn't handle it
The limo door opened, it was Janet
She jumped in the car, they started kissing and shit
I kicked back and let 'em have this dick
I told the driver ""Take me straight home""
Then called my partner on the car phone
I said ""I'll hook you with a bad-ass bitch""
Come to my house and don't even trip
He came over and we served the hoes
Fucked the bitches like gigalos
Paula and Janet will make you wet in your pants
But to me, they're just two more tramps

Check it out man, check this one out
I been rappin' for half my life
I'm twenty-eight now sayin' pass the mic
If you eighteen or nineteen speak up fool
I was born on the mic before you went to school
Talkin' bout pimp shit, you know whassup
I wonder if you mom'll let you play that stuff
Now you're flowin like your name is water
But I'm ten years older and my game is harder
I'm not tryin' to say you're out there dissin
I'm just tryin' to say lil nigga listen
Before you grab the mic and act wild
Bitin on the next nigga's mackin style
And it's all from head, passin round the mic
Never even care who you sounded like
Sound like Snoop Dogg, then you switched to Treach
Bit the Pharcyde then A Tribe Called Quest
And you gots no respect for me, is that right?
Well jump your ass on the train witcha backpack tight
And keep rappin', I'm floatin past all the stops
In a clean ass Benz I have all the props
Fuck credit from a rapper can you match my Visa
I heard your girlfriend was a real dick pleaser
And a Too $hort fan, faithfully
When I came to your town she couldn't wait to see me
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on 'cause I don't stop rappin'
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on 'cause I don't stop rappin'
Let me tell you somethin' 'bout a nigga named Short
Rappers always talk about the way I can't flow
But let me hit the mall with the same MC's
I be signin autographs, spend a gang of G's
While you walkin' round broke, nobody knows ya
Lookin' like you smoked a whole sack of doja
Outside in the parking lot in front of the cars
Standin in a circle with some wannabe stars
Freestylin, but you ain't original
You just shootin everything and you pimpin' hoes
And to think you could hang with me
I never would spit this game for free
I'm the T-double-O, S-H, O-R-T
I rock all stages and any parties
Any my style is gettin' bank
Gettin' head, gettin' hella dank
I drop my top when it's hot and sunny
So how you talk shit when you ain't havin' no money
I set trends in the rap game bitch
And gives a fuck when other rappers talk shit
I know you motherfuckers, heard me rap
So hard, I put your momma in my dirty rap
No shit, the old bitch sucked a damn good dick
Put them legs up high she couldn't handle it
I'm not a no good punk, I coulda macked your mother
But Life is Too $hort, so I kept it undercover
Now you're all grown up, with your partners rappin'
But old Short Dawg'll your ass what happened
To a fake MC, who tried to get with me
I ended his career, instantly
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on 'cause I don't stop rappin'
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on 'cause I don't stop rappin'
Now let's compare the lifestyles, of me and you
You're phony and I'm all about bein true
You drive a bucket, that you bought for a G
I ride around snuffin them fo'-eighteens
In the back of a motherfuckin big ass truck
Jump two rows back and get my dick sucked
Benzos, Lexus, Rolex and Caddy
Fine lil bitches havin' sex with Daddy
I ain't givin' no bitch, no kind of slack
You got one girl then treat the hoe like a mack
What's yours is hers, she don't trip
Sucker ass nigga need to check that bitch
But you're so weak, and it shows in your rap
I'm out here, gettin' hoes livin' fat
While you at home, gettin' sweated by your mamma
I bought my mother a house in Atlanta
And you can't stand it, so whaddayou say
Too $hort can't rap, no fuckin' way
But here I am, workin in the studio
And your album ain't out because you're movin slow
By the time you make one I'll be on ten
Hit the studio nigga, and do it again
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on 'cause I don't stop rappin'
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on 'cause I don't stop rappin'
Now ask New York, can Too $hort flow
Ask Detroit, they'll let them niggaz know
Then ask Philly, can I rap
South side of Chicago, who's the mack?
I never ever tripped on the shit that you spit about me
Everytime I perform, I make a lot of G's
'Cause I'm paid for this motherfuckin rap shit
Eatin good like a motherfuckin fat bitch
Every single day at the house what's wrong wichu
Eatin fast food if you only knew
I understand though, 'cause I been there befo'
Eat any damn thing and got nowhere to go
Daydreams, about bein great
It all started back when I was sellin tapes
In eighty-two eighty-three eighty-fo' on up
Waitin still waitin just to blow on up
And when it happened, I still had to wait
I didn't get paid till eighty-eight
I made nine albums in nine years
I'm a true blue West coast pioneer
Dr. Dre, Ice-T, and all the rest
All that money we makin' don't fault the West
'Cause we ain't the ones who created rap
But when we made the shit, we made it fat
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on 'cause I don't stop rappin'
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on 'cause I don't stop rappin'

I chose to live this life

I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
Till a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggaz
(Devin the Dude)
Niggaz trippin' - and for what?
Why must he think he 'posed to change her
When she'll give the pussy up even to a, total stranger
And, I'm just one of 'em, you can't trust none of them
They'll say they love you while they wipin your cum on them
Then they'll run and tell her friends how she found another sucker
To pay a fee for pus-sy but not - me, motherfuckahHHH
I move quick with my pool stick, Slicker than Willie
Slicker than Kelly, slicker than KY Jelly
But really this dick has got me in a lot of trouble recently
I bend 'em and go in 'em and don't even have the decency
To call her, my balls have been leaked of most of their fluids
I used to put the rubber on and skeet straight through it
And it seems, that I always keep my pipe in these hoes
Keep my mic at these shows, cause that's the life that I chose
(Devin the Dude - singing)
Pimp life!
I chose to live the - pimp life!
(Bun B of U.G.K.)
Come talk a walk up in my shoes, pay a couple of my dues
Roll my boulevard on trues, while your lady sings the blues
Got everythang to lose, not a damn thang to gain
I be tryin' to cross the line, but with that I gotta bring the pain
Now I tried to compromise, see the other side of the story
But that's easier said that done, when it comes to your pride and your glory
I'm a pimp with a glide in my worries, limp pimp I'ma step when I wreck
But my armor's on at all times, 'cause I gots me a rep to protect
Now I mights be known for this, and maybe recognized for that
But they be high-beamin me; and I be like where my visors at?
Nowadays I'm a wiser cat, after what I been through I better be
Back then I woulda broke ya broad, nowadays I just let her be
Cause through seconds minutes hours days weeks months and years
Man I reckon that it's power fuckin' freaks blunts and beers
That ain't what I'm supposed to be

Yeah I have menage-a-trois with superstars, one night stands, quickies
Booty calls, it ain't nuttin for her to just stick around here and lick me
'Cause I run through broads and never get enough, maybe I'm too selfish
But I cain't help it... can't stay witchu girl 'cause I can't tell if it's
Official, or just another ritual
It's hard for me to find a wife, it's nothin' for me to, get a hoe
I know it sounds, pitiful, sometimes I'm blessed, sometimes I'm cursed
If it's supposed to be the best then tell me, what's the worst?
I'll be a P-F-L, till I'm a old nigga
'Cause I never spend my life with groupies, or golddiggers
I see these bitches now, shake it naked tryin' to make it
If you spendin all his money take it bitch you can't fake it
When it's real, I'm cappin like the snub-nosed, they pay me
I love hoes, never go home when the club close
I do shows, ride new vogues and keep two hoes
I'm all about this money girl, that's why I chose

With a pimp stick on a pimp throne, that lazy ho better get goin',

157,Pimp Shit,2000,You Nasty (2000),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Intro: Kokane (Too $hort)
Too Sheezy, (what's up main?)
Playa (for life baby)
You got to go out there
And handle your buisiness (get my money)
Handle yours, playas play on (bitch)
Nigga that's pimp shit (bitches gonna pay me)
What you say? (Oh these hoes gon' pay me)
Nothin' but the hog in me (nothin' but the dog in me baby)
Nigga that's pimp shit (born to mack)
Nothin' but the hog in me (that's what I said)
Verse 1: Too $hort
I was born to mack and at a young age
I knew I'd be a real pimp someday
So I practiced my walk, I studied the game
I never been a sucker but I was still lame
Some things never change but my game elevated
When it comes to pimpin' hoes I been truly educated
'Cause I'm so slick, I make hoes turn tricks
Players University, class of '86
And I'm hard on a bitch, go ask my first ho
I was 17 then and now I'm 34
I'ma still be a pimp till the day I die
On every street corner, and every high rise
I got the best women that money can buy
When I talk about the game, I never lie
Ask me why that lil girl made her momma cry
You wanna know I'll tell you why, nigga
Hook: Kokane (Too $hort)
Nigga that's pimp shit (get that money main)
Nothin' but the hog in me (nothin' but the dog in me baby)
Nigga that's pimp shit (that's right)
Nothin' but the hog in me
(Get that money bitch, get that money bitch)
Verse 2: Too $hort
She got lost and turned out at a young age
I knew she'd be a real ho someday
When she was 10, she was freaky back then
She would let the lil boys rub on her pants
She liked sittin' on a grown man's lap
When she was 14, she let 'em fuck her from the back
For some scratch, she let 'em hit
Pull up her skirt, and lick on her clit
Lil fine ass bitch, with some big ol' tits
Made her first pimp rich with that good shit
But at the age of 26 she's an old ho
She don't really look that good no mo'
But she could make a trick cum in a minute
Anything you want you can get it
Anything you pay for, she'll earn
Give her some money, she'll take your sperm, nigga
Hook: Kokane (Too $hort)
Nigga that's pimp shit (get your money girl, get that money girl)
Nothin' but the hog in me (nothin' but the dog in me bitch)
Niggas that's pimp shit (pimp shit, yeah, fa sho)
Nothin' but the hog in me
(Oh you know pimpin' is the oldest profession)
Verse 3: Too $hort
He used to give the girls his lunch money when he was young
For a kiss on the cheek, he thought it was fun
I knew he'd be a real trick one day
Lettin girls ride his bike, let 'em win when they play
He was soft, and females made him week
When you got no game, the only way to make a freak
Is to pay em, and that's what he grew up and did
He won't lie, ask him what he do for a bitch
Spend cash, just to get some ass
He tried to marry a ho, but the shit didn't last
He broke the golden rule, I hope he never tried
His own wife, own house, and he still had to die
That's fucked up, but that's the life of a trick
Be a sucker for a bitch and she'll suck your dick
I know he loves her, I don't doubt him
She pulled out his money, said ""I love things about him""
Hook: Kokane (Too $hort)
Nigga that's pimp shit (pimp shit)
Nothin' but the hog in me (nothin' but the dog in me baby)
Nigga that's pimp shit (get that money girl, get ya money bitch)
It's nothin' but the hog in me
Nigga that's pimp shit
Nothin' but the hog in me"

It's like Too raps been around a while
I rocked to the beat and got my own style
I'm from the O city, and I said it before
I was born to mack, call me Playboy
You wanna get freaky? Look at the time
We could do the nasty, but it's almost nine
My show starts at ten, I gots to go
Like the mack said, homie, pimp the ho
Check it out everybody, if you got two ears
Turn your radio up, Short Gog is here
If the bass ain't kickin, pick up the phone
Dial 911, tell em: turn it on
Bumped a cute young tender in a tight red dress
She had a soft booty, and a real big chest
She said, ""I love you"", said it again
At the motel freaked her and her friends
Like a Too rap, and everybody knows
Like the Mack said, homie, pimp the hoes
Ain't no need in playin' games, none at all
Fakin like a giant when you're just too small
No need to rush, take your time
To adjust to the changes in my rhyme
To you rappers - tonight's your night
You all jump straight up on your mic
Screamin ""I'm the best"", but let me see
I make a lotta money, could that be me?
He said, ""Hell no, I'm the king of the rap""
Looked me in my eyes, said, ""Deal with that""
I said, ""Hold on, buddy, don't talk that junk
You drank two 40s, now you must be drunk""
He said, ""Let's battle"", I said ""Go""
Like the Mack said, homie, I pimped the ho
All hail the king, go straight to hell
If your girlfriend's freakin on a freaky tale
Better play your rap and take mine off
Before the bitch gets wet and you're still soft
No need to rush, take your time
To adjust to the changes in my rhyme
I was on the turf, cold chillin' out
When a sucker MC got hit in the mouth
Tryin' to find out if he can hang with me
The boy got hooked on the Dope Fiend Beat
I said, ""Bitch, what are you smokin'?""
It ain't funny, cool, I ain't jokin
You never shoulda said I was fakin the place
You wouldn'ta got socked straight in your face
I'm the coldest MC on a microphone
Now the sucker MC's just leave me alone
They might suck on yours, but they can't get mine
Like the Mack said, homie, pimp all the time
I'm not talkin' bout hookers in mini-skirts
When you pimp like me, put your mind to work
It's like 24 hoes, better known as tracks
When I grab that mic I spit these raps
I start workin the hoes, and it just don't stop
It's goin' on till the panties drop
I'm Sir Too, like I said
Bitch can't lick, don't give me head
Had a fresh young tender, won't say her name
It's the same old story, ran the same old game
She can blow more head than a well blows water
The girl won't stop when she get started
Like the freak you married, I had to get with her
Ain't no doubt, Short Dog would get her
I'm a cold player, I can't lie
They call me Playboy, and I told you why
I'm a mack, so get back
I put my tape in the deck in my Cadillac
And as my ride goes on definitely
I speak each word loud as can be
I'm the T-double o, and like I said
If your girlfriend's freakin, I accept all head
Scream out the combination, and I open the lock
Plug in the mic jack, and then rock that cock
Back to back like the Oakland Raiders
In and out like your crossfaders
Makin' people dance all over the floor
Lovin' that rapper named Sir Too
You got my bank, little girl, no time to act silly
I'm dynamite, baby, and my name ain't Willy
Cold as hell, hard to stop
I spit these raps and rock yo block
Hit the city talkin' bout, it's goin' on
And the next thing you know, the whole nation's gone
It's Too on the mic
And I'm spittin' mo' raps than any rapper you like
So all you suckers-worth rappers, you hate my beat
All I gotta say is, don't fuck with me
My game is tight, my bank is made
You can hate big, but I still get paid
You say, ""I can't"", I say you can
Show respect, little boy, when you deal with a man
I saw you laughin' when you came in the place
Punk, I start laughin' when I spit in your face
See I know how I feel, I should be shut at dawn
But I'm a true MC, I keep rockin' on
I won't say I'm best, won't declare I'm bad
I'm just a rappin' muthafucka with a hard-ass rap
Too cold comin' up
Say a rap, homeoby, get the mic out your butt
Be a man if you can, cause it might get worse
You be walkin' round town with a wig and a purse
No tellin' what's next, I don't know
Like the Mack said, homie, pimp the ho
(I'll be good to you
You'll be good to me
Anything you want
Or anything you need
I got my eye on you
And I'm into you
I'll give you all my dough
You just pimp that ho)
I'm never draggin when I'm rhymin, 'cause I make a lotta money
I jump in my car, drop it if it's sunny
Doggin the freaks, and all that shit
Long haired hoes with real big tits
I'm a eastside player oh yes, I am
Grab the microphone and start makin' grands
I take a freak to her room, not a hotel trick
I cold chill out at the Motel Six
I'm ridin' in the car, and I can't be found
I'm the hardest muthafucka rappin' from this town
My name is Sir Too, and if you say 'so what?'
I look you in your eye, and wouldn't give a fuck
I live a California lifestyle, ain't no trip
8 years on the mike, and ain't faked it yet
So when you see me on stage, I won't blow you a kiss
I put my finger in the air and tell you just like this
Say bitch

163,Pimpology,1990,Short Dog's in the House (1990),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"(Pimp): all we want is the money
(Pimp 2): I keep em' bro. wake up one morning, and, with some money
To spend, they go crazy.
I'm going to tell you a story in stereo,
About the pimping game, that you should know.
But if you don't, it's all right.
'Cause I'll be spittin' this game to you all damn night.
When I was 3 years old,
Straight pimp game I was told.
My daddy sent me to pimp school.
In this man's world, you can't be no fool.
If a pimp is what you wanna be,
You're gonna have to learn pimpology.
Pimpology: a pimp's profession.
Can't be effected by the great depression.
So if you want to be giant sized,
Come to my school. get pimp-matized.
In your school, what do they teach?
English, math, and history.
Pimpin' game, you can learn.
And if you do, you will earn
A pimp diploma, just for you
For learning what you're taught when you come to school.
Lesson 1, you should know:
Never fall in love, with your ho.
Lesson 2 tells you to do only one thing:
Act cool.
Lesson 3:
Don't be a trick. if she's poor, if she's rich,
If your game is soft or hard,
It shouldn't take long to break the broad.
Lesson 4:
Keep ya ho. it's the most important thing to know.
'Cause I pimp or die. I'm like the mack:
Riding around oakland in a cadillac.
But on the other hand, if you can't pimp
And the hos keep treating you like a simp,
I don't know what to say about you boys.
You better go to the store and buy some toys.
'Cause you can't play this game.
(Pimp talking):
Next time you hear grown folks talking, shut the fuck up y' hear?
Now you heard my story in stereo:
About the pimpin' game, that you should know.
And if you don't, it's all right,
'Cause I'll be spittin' this game to ya all damn night.
I'm short dog. ain't nothing nice.
I never rap fake when I'm on the mic.
I ride around town in a clean benz.
Never ever frontin' on my real cool friends.
My zodiac sign is a taurus the bull.
I drink old English, and I do get full.
If you're wondering why I don't stop my rap,
'Cause other MC's can't rock like that.
My music flows like domino's.
I pimp these hoes that's how it goes.
Tenders on my beeper all day and night.
I'm a true blue player homeboy. that's right.
O-a-k-l-a-n-d:
That's where I rain, top dog MC.
Too short, baby, on the microphone.
I work more tails. I don't take freaks home.
Man, they start trippin' when they think your rich.
Met her yesterday. all on my tip.
It's not hard to believe. but that's how it goes.
I'm burning rubber on these hoes like vogues.
Check out my style. baby don't stop.
If you can't call me short, just call me dog.
Black is my color. I have no other. nothing else will do.
I've got a black car, black bed, black TV
I've even got a silk black suit.
Dangerous music, and the dangerous crew,
Oakland, ca, and the playboy too.
West coast rapping al over the place.
Too short, baby, all in your face.
I rap so hard¡you can't stop me.
My last album sold a million copies.
Me and the maestro, laying the beat.
DJ scratches from my homeboy pete.
Dangerous music is what you hear.
A new LP, every year.
You know we rolling. can't be faking.
We come through, and all your girls, we're taking.
You know we're rolling. don't do no simpin'.
Oaktown players, strictly pimpin', baby.
My name is short. just what you've been looking for.
Sending young tenders on a wild goose chase.
Up in the hills, trying to find my place.
Getting lost, getting tossed, getting found and clowned.
Every time you see short baby, you get down.
'Cause the raps I make are the raps you like.
The way sir too short rocks the mic.
It's a one of a kind, rapping style.
Have the freaks in the crowd, going wild.
For when I spit my rhyme, I just don't quit.
Grab the microphone, and just make me rich.
(Pimp 1): it was $35, 000.
(Pimp 2): $35,000 cash money?
(Pimp 1): no. I get 1. $35, 000 plus 1, right?
(Pimp 2): the one I gave you?
(Pimp 1): no, I gave you 6 all right. I had 1. now $35,000 plus 6
Right.
Now $35, 000 plus 1, plus 6 makes 7.
$35, 000 plus 7, right. motha fucka, can you buy that?"

It's me, $hort, the one and only
Spitting that rap to all my homies
You know about you, you know I'm a star
When I rap too good I might take it too far
Had the whole damn crowd going wild
'Cause I don't stop rapping, that's my style
Too $hort baby from East Oakland
I got more hoes than I can count on my hand
You got women? Well I got more
You don't know? Shit, I'm Playboy $hort
They call me "";Playboy $hort""; known everywhere
Had a life long dream to be a player
Way too cold at a younger age
It was every day, just make that page
Still playing the same, still young at the game
Never talk down on a player's name
'Cause I'm big time, paid all my dues
I'm rich and famous and way too cool
People can't fuck with the way I'm rhyming-aca"
168,Playboy Short II,1987,Born to Mack (1987),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
You see I made up my mind when I was seventeen
I ain' with no marriage and a weddin' ring
I be a player fo' life so where's my wife
Prob'ly at the rehab stuck on the pipe
'Cause she must be smokin' and I'm not jokin'
Too Short baby comin' straight from Oakland
Got way mo' bitches than I ever need
I put that on a big fat bag of weed
'Cause I can give you a bitch who wouldn't give you joint
Bitches ain' shit and now I made my point
So you can light that weed
While I spit this rap
And tell you 'bout a player from way back
I was only fourteen when I first got my dick sucked
Now I'm grown up and I really like to bust nuts
Gittin' freaky in the right situations
You wanna rap well that's a nice occupation
To git pussy when you want 'n' how you want it foo'
'Cause I was fuckin' ugly hoes back in high schoo'
I used to fuck young-ass hoes
Used to be broke and didn't have no clothes
Now I fuck top notch bitches
Tellin' stories 'bout rags to riches
'Bout a pimp named Shorty from the Oakland set
Been mackin' fo' years 'n' ain't fell of yet
So if you ever see me rollin' in my drop top caddy
Throw a peace sign and say hey pimp daddy
'Cause I never would fron' on my folks
I slow down and let the gold diggers count my spokes
Bitches come a dime a dozen
So don't get mad when I fuck your cousin
Your two sisters, I even fuck your ex-bitch
Short Dog in the house with some player shit
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
All the fake players peep game from the real
Player hatin' lover tell me how do ya feel
When you front to the homies how you grind 'em
Look fo' a tramp, but you can't find 'em
You got one girlfriend you see her every night
Comin' around the partners, lyin' about your life
Looked at your watch it said six twenty-two
Cut to the house and said baby I love you
Can't act like a mack like playboy Sho'
An' the rest of the macks in the streets of the O bitch
Comin' up we learn how to freak these hoes
And when your through gittin' yours then you shake these hoes
And when your older, it's nothin' but a routine
Makin' G's everyday workin' blue jeans
I know I seen it before
I see it again
Young tender saying Short would you be my man
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
Yeah there's alot of fake players out there
Talkin' bad about Ant Banks, you know what I'm sayin'
But hey ain' trippin' up
Short Dog, what you do about them player haters
Try 'n' stay away from Kriss Kross imitators
Put ya in a cross 'cause they really jus' haters
I thought you knew, Short Dog is a player
Born to mack, 'n got bitches everywhere
I ride around town in my clean-ass cars
Screenin' these hoes like movie stars
Checkin' my traps like a dirty rat
I was born to mack
I'm hookin' hoes like crack, I be a monkey on your back bitch
Until you kick that Short Dog habit got you on my dick
And even though I can't fuck you every day
That's 'cause I got another bitch aroun' the way
We can all get together on a late night
Cut to the house hook somethin' up real tight
I really don't care
'Cause I'm a player
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass"
169,Player Card,2010,Still Blowin' (2010),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Nah baby
I don't think I wanna be a player no mo'
I done been through a lot of hoes
Lot of women, lot of bitches, lot of relationships
All the drama
Tryin' to find a real one baby
(Chorus: Shanell 2X)
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card
(Too $hort)
There comes a time in every player's life
When you think about a family and havin' a wife
You had enough - you cain't take this shit
Put a end to all the meaningless relationships
And find one that means everything
I'm talkin' 'bout white dresses and wedding rings
Used to be strip clubs and the Bunny Room
But now you're in love on a honeymoon
You used to keep a extra chick
Just for booty calls and sexy trips
But now you at the grocery sto'
Target, Wal*Mart, and Home Depot
If you break out of prison, and jump the wall
You couldn't even get a date you wouldn't know who to call
You had a lot of women and you played 'em hard
But you retired now, give up that player card!
(Too $hort)
A lot of players, call it quits
Come across the love pit and fall in it
Ain't nuttin wrong with love
Early in the morning you just want a hug
I've been there a million times
Asked me how I'm doin' - I'm feelin' fine
But really what I feel inside
Is the need, to have somethin' real in my life
... I had it before
But I'm like Cameo, I go ""Back and Forth""
... Like Big Pun and Joe
Sometimes ""I don't wanna be a player no more""
And when the time comes around, you know what's next
Throw away my phone and my rolodex
It's gone, and I didn't even notice it
My player card expired and I'm stuck with my old bitch
(Too $hort)
Your player card got revoked
And it cain't be renewed - no it's not a joke
Once you give it up, it's hard to get it back
Cause fallin' in love is like hittin crack
One hit and you a junkie
All day and night you'll be lickin' that monkey
You love the way it's sticky and funky
You said I don't wanna live, if she don't want me
I never had days like that
'Cause I came up in Oakland, raised by macks
I gotta get that scratch
I get it from a batch, or from my rats
It's gon' happen, cause the game is here
Ask Bishop Don Juan, I'm a famous player
You know when love'll happen for me?
When I start buyin hookers, and rappin' for free
Never~!
It ain't expired yet baby
I'm thinkin' 'bout renewin it

Player For Life
Player For Life baby
Sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be a player
But I am...
Smoke one wit'cha potnah mayne
You in the mix with Too $hort, ""Still Blowin'""
New album comin' soon baby
What's my favorite word?"
170,Player for Life,2001,Chase the Cat (2001),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"(Repeat 3X)
Gotta be a player for life, gotta be a player for life
(That's right) Gotta be a player for life, I gotta be a player for life
(Too $hort)
Smob to the tip, I feel no guilt
She's young and she's fine and she bout to get peeled
I know you heard why, no need to tell
You lookin' at a certified P.F.L.
You wanna be like me? I don't think you can
Your girlfriend loves you, need to be her man
She never told you how she was a Too $hort fan
She kept it to herself, you wouldn't understand
I met her at the mall when she was mad at you
She said, gimme a call and I was glad to
That night, I gave your girl a ex tab...
... The best sex she ever had
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
I gotta be a player for life, I gotta be a player for life
(Too $hort)
It'd be nice to wake up to some little smilin' faces
Sayin', ""Daddy"" - instead of bein in wild faces
Smokin' fatties, fo' hoes in my Caddy
Each one willin' to have me
Sometimes you want my life, sometimes I want yours
I'm tryin' to find a wife and you tryin' to find whores
Which one of us is lookin' in the devil's eyes?
I'd settle down if I could have seven wives
But that's illegal, and everywhere we go
We roll through the town takin' every ho
And of course, we show no remorse
I'm doin' one-twenty with your ho in the Porsche
(Too $hort)
Till death do us part, with all yo' heart
It was love - right from the start
But could you do it - would you change yo' life
And get married, stop runnin' game every night?
Ex-player with his wife and kids
Lookin' happy; I wonder if he really is
I would hate to be committed even though I ain't wit it
Still out in the streets tryin' to get it
It's hard for a man with access to one vagina
To be faithful, when she's so much finer
Than his wife - she seen it comin'
He fell in love with another woman
(Too $hort)
I keep comin' back to the same thought
Fallin' in love'll throw the game off
You let her get to you, you know you still care
But I was raised by them real players
I try to tell the homies fuck the party
This player lifestyle ain't for everybody
You gotta make your own choice - it's yo' life
How would it be without yo' kids, and no wife?
Wakin' up with a tramp - you don't like
Nigga, you better hear what I'm sayin' on the mic
You wanna be a pimp, you better go back home
Leave them tramps alone, you know you wrong
You wrong"

Players are the realest time to go
If you don't understand I'll let you know
Players are the people who just can't stand
Having one woman and just one man
Players are the ones who always see
Players are the ones that you always meet
Couldn't fall in love, even if you tried
Couldn't be devoted unless you lied
It's the players in the world to the west you play
Fresh young tenders every day
Breaking hearts every time your love is real
Players say love just ain't the deal
But the old and wise couldn't tell you why
Players just don't live happy lives
So all you fake wannabe's I hope you hear

Parties all going and players come
Sometimes in 3's sometimes in 2's
Fresh ball point pens, ready to use
It all makes sense, maybe it doesn't
Players just always use that lutten
Give it up everyday when the players play
Just don't act snoty when the players say
What's your name and number let me get my pen
Do you have any sisters too and that's to Kim
'Cause I rap to Kim, and that's the truth

You could love so much, just give you time
Your nothing but a player don't say you're mine
Cause the way I love, is not your type
Trying to get everything you can for life
Too bad you don't know what I think you should
Too much of a good thing ain't so good
Your nothing but a player, whatever you feel

I'll fuck your lil' sister
Then fly her out of town nigga what I don't miss her
(Beitch!) You ain't hard as me
I fuck hookers, but they don't be chargin me
What about the tramps and sluts?
I fucked a few, but I can't get enough
Of them educated, sophisticated
Got a good job and other bitches hate it
You know the kind of woman that's hard to get
Know just what to do with a hard dick
I even like 'em young
I keep 'em up all night I'm just havin' fun
But I don't need strippers, rippers or a hoe
Right now I need a pro
I need a porn star
I got a big-ass dick, and I was born hard
I want some professional head
I'm tired of havin' sex in the bed
Let's fuck on the kitchen counter
And make a sex tape, yeah bitch I'm down~!
I'll fuck you like Mr. Marcus
Get butt naked let's get this started
Drop that dress on the floor
Turn the camera on, and press record
I'm 'bout to make you a star
Boost that ass up on a stool at the bar
Are you willing and able
To ride this dick on a pool table?
Cause after that, it's shower sex
Can you handle another hour of this?
I'm talkin' 'bout Tera Patrick
Sunny Leone, now that's a bad bitch
AnnMarie, and Puma Swede
I want all them bitches to do me
I'll take Jesse Jane, get her wet and gushy
Alia Love, she'll eat her pussy
Anne T was my favorite bitch
Vanessa Blue with them big lips
I can't forget, Jenna Haze
I want to bust a nut, in her face
I'm comin', but it might take a while
I gotta do a scene with Shyla Stylez
And after that, it's Nikki Benz
All I wanna do, is stick it in
Girladonna, and Charmane Star
I wanna fuck Monique Alexander

You made a lot of money since you hit the stage
Swingin' on the pole so many different ways
Got hit with a butt cheek and smacked ya back
You're a dancer but you shoulda been a acrobat
I don't even know if it's bald or bushy
I see them titties out girl but I ain't saw no pussy
What we gotta do to see you get butt naked
And shake it, how much you tryin' to make bitch?
You could do it easily, is this how you gon' do me?
You're teasin' me, pulled 'em halfway down your booty
You need to let them panties meet them ankles
Show 'em you a bad bitch, fuck these stank hoes
You know I go hard all night
I'm famous, I've been a star all my life
You need to take them draws off
Do it girl, take it all off

Take that g-string off, take everything off
Why you still wearin' clothes, girl you must be lost
Let that monkey out, go 'head do your thang
Take them panties off, and let that pussy hang

I'd get you undressed, I'd make you stay wet
I'd burn a lot of rubber, all in your walls

You know you can't win, hangin' with your scary ass friends
Flossin' at the club but you never had a Benz
Now these bitches wanna hurt you
They say you act gay, you probably wear skirts too
That's what they say, they callin' you a faggot
It might be a problem, you better call some back-up
Fuck a credit card, can't go to Western Union
Use the ATM, or just keep it movin'
Ain't nobody chasin' you, not if you ain't runnin'
But if you in this club man you gotta spend some money
He don't wanna buy a dance but he can't stop lookin'

Fake punk-ass bitches...
Do you know what I mean vern?
Fuckin'em up like this, vern...
$Hort dog's in the house, bitch!
She's a punk-ass bitch, hoe, tramp and a slut
Took her to the hotel just to fuck
Last night she licked all on my balls
Pussy got wet like niagara-falls
Dropped my drawls and bitch said: shit!
Skinny mothafucka with a fat-ass dick
It's like a t-p-treatment, tongue so fast
From the tip of my head to the crack of my ass
She got busy so I called to the crew
You bitches know what to do
Hoes try to front like they ain't no tramps
Try to get that pussy and she say you can't
Me and my partners we got that game
Check a square-ass bitch and make her throw that thang
You wine and dine that nasty freak
Dropped her off and got a kiss on cheek
You never even know how she ran in the home
Jumped on the phone and started to burnin' me out
She kept beepin' so I made the call
Bitch on the phone jackin' off
Sounded like she was havin' fun
Playin' with her pearl tongue
I said: bitch, I'm on my way!
I givit to you, homeboy, play by play
She had on polkadots with miniskirt
Jumped in the car straight went to work
I must to bust two nuts back to back
Never seen a bitch work head like that
She had me jumpin' out of my seat
Workin' her jaws to the beat
She was a good dicksucker, I can't lie
Sucked so good I thought I'd die
Bitch blew me up and blew me down
All the way back to the oakland-town
Baby started to singin': I love you!
Tellin' me things she wanted to do
If I needed some money come to her
Everythin' I want is everythin' I'm worth
And you know what I said? I told the bitch
I said: bitch, I'm rich!
Fuck these hoes, man...
I ain't trippin'...I'm like al...
Long-hair suckers...
I know you're fine, bitch
But you got no cash you need to get a job
But your lazy-ass try to juice me up
I ain't no punk
I put you in the rap with some serious funk
I wouldn't buy you a car, no diamonds and shit
All the time talkin' about your fake-ass gifts
George bought you a ring, john bought you a chain
Bitch, I'm buyin' you an ounce of this game
You better take it and shut the fuck up
Stop runnin' your mouth like a sucka
'Cause you's a punk bitch it shows a mile away
Everythin' you do and everythin' you say
Makes you a punk bitch, no good, no doubt
All I gotta do is stick a dick in your mouth
Wanna give up the pussy, bitch, I'll pass
You're too slim, I like your mama's ass
Pops came home, came up short
Found me in the backroom, fuckin'em both
Now I'm the stepdaddy and the son in law
You call me too $hort they call me too raw
I creep out one room into the next
Nothin' goin' on but some serious sex
Some of these hoes might think I'm played
Bald-head bitch need some dookie braids
Cause that nappy-hair don't even hit
What's cookin' in the kitchen on the back of your neck
Like you burned the rise and wanna front on me
You could never fuck with $hort, baby
I'm from the o-a-k-l-a-n-d
I slap you in the face with reality
These punk-ass hoes out here is sick
Have ya walkin' round with a drippy dick
So beautiful fine young thang
To get that cock was just like a dream
But now three days later ask kool moe
You feel the burnin' sensation down below
You're a true blue victim of a punk-ass bitch
Thought she was a square and she gave you the shit
So for all you hoes that live like this

Tryin' to give her all your money, but whatchu gon' get?
I get 'em all, suited at the player's ball
Up against the wall, just got another number to call
Y'all see me I'm a real player, I do this nightly
You wanna fight me, cause you can't be like me
All you hatin' ass suckers in the place
You better stop starin' in my motherfuckin face
Too many jealous thoughts goin' through yo' mind
You mad like you guilty, goin' to do some time
Pay yo' pussy bill nigga if you want a date
But you just talkin' shit I figure you just wanna hate
You hater!
(V. White)
Now you can catch me I-80 in the diamond lane gettin' head
In the rearview, make a wrong move and I gotsta have your head
I put 23's in the game on the Avalanche and give you the blues
And blow white smoke up out the sunroof while we keep it on cruise
I ride with a hog in the back and the vogue in the back and you hatin' on that
It's just V. White, T. $hort, Twista boy we blazin' on track
It's just that Eastside psycho-chronological mind-stopper
Keep a burner at yo' waist while we serve these haters proper
You better get up, get out, get somethin'; nigga, and stop frontin
If I had no car and stayed with my momma then I'd be hatin' on somethin'
Nah but nope, not me, I give 'em out, above the knee
You could catch one in the torso, b-2-1-2, fuckin' with me
Now you can hate me all you want to 'cause I ain't hard to find
I got hitters on payroll and parolees dyin' to shine
That'll leave a hole in your dome like Rogaine, old school like road games
You can't stop me from shinin, I'm highly flammable like propane
(Too $hort)
Yeah we got some real players in this motherfucker
Too $hort, Twista, V. White, Lil' Jon, Eastside Boyz, Delinquents
Yeah we see you haters up in this motherfucker
Tryin' to kick it like us real players
But you know what we gon' do?
We gon' sift you motherfuckin haters out
And we gon' beat yo' motherfuckin ass
Yeah that's right, whup that hater's ass
Beat his ass!
Like he stole somethin'...

I got the call, stuck at the crib, hoe I'm ready for war
Call your boy I got the deals and I'm hittin the do'
I got some niggaz with them figures waitin at the club
Gettin' jigga with a swigga while I'm sittin' on dubs
Lookin' fake as hell, I keep my nails ready to fight
Club closed, powdered nose, I'm on one tonight

Watch yo' back 'cause if he gangsta then I'm takin' yo' mayne
Haha, y'all bitches ain't keep shit real

Y'all bitches is scared and y'all been dared to make a move hoe
It's Joan of Arc, pullin guns on y'all hatin' hoes
(Pimp C)
My baby momma butler hooked me with thirty-six
So many games cookin whippin down 55 in this bitch
Niggaz thought that I was slumpin I was steadily pumpin
Niggaz talkin' 'bout a drop but man I ain't dealin' nothin'
I'm a self made nigga on the grind in the skreets
I ain't really wanna do it but my baby had to eat
From sales to hotels and dough from pote (?) nail
Pay everybody bail, ain't no spendin time in jail
Been around the world, y'all niggaz ain't seen all the shit I seen
Them girls, send them to Essence 'cause they sixteen
I'm comin' through a couple bars to pimp them nipplezeens
In Southern Benz, S-Class, know what the fuck I mean?
A pimper, a stankin shriver (?) a Jack Tripper
A candy sweet dipper playin' with cock and suckin on nipples
Every day my game get thicker, gettin' good head from champagne sippers
Rapper the bird flipper, man, a motherfuckin nigga
(Verse Three)
Haters can't get it 'cause I ride with thugs, killers
Can only date the millionaires and drug dealers
Takin' notes from Scarface and Goodfellas
Straight gangsters or them motherfuckein hoodfellas
Pretty and still gritty, like Frank Nitti
And I, flaunt my titties like I'm on ""Sex and the City""
So here we go again, daddy short, why they hatin'?
Cause ain't none bitch this rich and hit makin'
(Too $hort having convo that starts over Chorus)
What's up Todd?
What's up with you girl, what's goin' on?
Ah shit, the usual, fly from here to there
Doin' a little bit of change, legal money - ha ha ha
Like that? Guess what, you know you on my album right?
What? So what are you saying Todd?
He he he, I'm sayin' that, it's goin' down right now baby
The song is called ""Quit Hatin',"" and I just wanna know
What would you say to the haters in yo' life?
Niggaz hatin'... bitches hatin'... fuck 'em!
(Singer - repeat to fade)
You ain't gotta hate me so much
Just show me some love, when I pull up on dubs
And you ain't gotta pay me to fuck
Just show me some love, when you see me at the club"
178,Rap Like Me,1990,Short Dog's in the House (1990),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Too $hort, MC
Rap like me, you'll go straight to the top
Keep doing what you're doing and you're sure to get dropped
Like a trick, nothing's even up my sleeve
A million albums sold and it's hard to believe
Well it's true homeboy, it's not a lie
I used to sell tapes on sunnyside
I used to catch the 40 bus around the way
Me and fred benz, slanging tapes
All these things, that we did
Grab the microphone and start screaming bitch!
You fronting MC, I hate to cap
You make hit records and you still can't rap
I said it before, I'll say it again
You don't believe me, ask your fans
When I walked into cali, the place was packed
Sir too $hort don't stop that rap
I keep rapping my rhymes, all the time
You got no rhymes, so you listen to mine
I'm not starting a fight, just telling it right
The best damn rapper who ever grabbed the mic
His name is too $hort, now shut your mouth
In '81 I was rocking the house
I'm a hustler, baby, coming up
I hustle every day and I don't sell drugs
I don't run no gangs, don't shoot no dice
Gave the same damn speech to the oakland vice
But if you keep pushing, just like you
When they see me on the strip, coming through
I break it down so vicious it'll break your back
With the beat so loud playing too $hort raps
That's it, I'm set
No need to talk that bullshit
I need a, oaktown, big time sound
Just enough beat to get on down
So, you other rappers listen to mine
You wouldn't catch short dog rapping nursery rhymes
Call my rap trash, jam the junk
Put a sticker on the cover: x-rated funk
It's just me, you say I won't go far
But I won't stop rapping 'cause I rap so hard
>From here to new york, back to California
I bumped your girlfriend, don't say I didn't warn ya
All this time you said she's your ho
You really shouldn't give baby all that dough
She gave it all to me 'cause I fuck so good
I practice on the girls in my neighborhood
'Cause when I'm freaky I rap, I spit a rap to a freak
I rarely ever think about a sucker MC
I go platinum, it's just like slapping 'em, bitch
Short dog in the house, starting some shit
MC's rock and MC's roll
But the albums they make never go gold
When I was young, I knew I'd be one of the best
Every time I made a song it came out so fresh
I was the king of the oaktown, spitting my game
10 years later, ain't nothing changed
Still the boss of the bay, and I know what they say
They call me godfather and they call you gay
Bitch! it's 1990
Your girlfriend's out there trying to find me
She heard about me, I fucked her best friend
I guess she wants to see if I can do it again
You want to be like me, so damn bad
The impossible dream all you MC's had
If you could rap like me, you wouldn't have the dream
Start rapping quit flapping like a chicken wing
If could rap like me, they say you're so great
But when they talk about you, they say you're so fake
And as the days go by, you can't forget
The way I make you feel like shit
MC's like you, I've seen 'em before
You keep on saying fuck too $hort
But I'm a better MC than you
And ain't a damn thing you can do, but bitch
On the TV screen, in the magazines
When they interview you, you just make up things
You're on an ego trip and you're fronting like you're down
You're not the first real rapper from the oakland town
You're just a new jack, and you can't even rap
You wanna trip? trip on that
I'm like MC lyte, checking hoes tonight
If you're not a real rapper, get off the mic
'Cause with a fake MC, a song's never complete
You'd better learn to rap like me
Thought you want to be like too $hort (scratched 2x)
Whenever I rap, you call it noise
I'm tearing up shit up like the acorn boys
On 10th street, I got a big freak
Until you learn to speak, realize you're weak
'Cause it's the oaktown, and they all get down
To the rhythm of the too $hort funky sound
It goes boom, baseline's on ya
Dangerous crew from oakland, California
Bitch don't front cause short dog is hard
If you answer my rap, I tear your ass apart
Just liket this, it lasts forever
You make a song and I make one better
You say I cuss, I say you're fake
Your eyes pop open like paper plates
You fronting MC, I hate to cap
I make hit records with the vicious raps
I said it before, I'll say it again
The boy ain't nothing but one of my fans
Like silicon titties, can you feel 'em?
How can a fake rapper fuck with a real one?
Shit, I'm that rapping man
I like you like the klu klux klan
Motherfucker want to front on me?
My posse got a real MC, too $hort
And it don't stop, and it don't stop, and it won't stop
'Cause I'm too $hort baby on the microphone and I'm macking, bitch
Thought you want to be like too $hort (scratched 4x)
Now back to the subject, my boy MC
Whatever you say, you can't rap like me
Rappers like me make real hits
Rappers like you talk bullshit
I told my boys there's a new funky drummer in town
You're trying to be like james brown
If I couldn't be me, who would I be?
I damn sure wouldn't be a sucker MC
'Cause I'm not like you, my game is true
I pimped these hoes and I pimped you, too
'Cause I'm boss, and boss makes the rules
You disobey and you be a fool (now listen)
One, remember how it all began
Don't guess, the answer is oakland
Two, you'd better learn to rap like me
Or you like to be a fake MC
Three, never talk down on a player
I wouldn't care if you was fred astaire
Last but not least, number four:
Don't ever fuck with too $hort, bitch
Thought you want to be like too $hort (scratched 2x)"

If I don't, I find a new bitch
And if you tryin' to get back it's useless
I can't do shit, unless you pay me
I been breakin in hoes since the 80's
Ain't nuttin changed, it's still a pimp thang
And if you ain't wit it, you must be insane
(Chyna)
Yeah you might talk like a pimp, walk with a limp
But look - you bout old as the game
Short Dawg shit is all in your name
And fuck dick, cause it all be the same
Shit, I be the one to get in your brain
To make you know you ain't shit
You got a Benz, I got a Jag, so what?
You got hoes, I got niggaz to cut
And I treat 'em like prostitutes and sluts
Take it from Chyna; niggaz ain't shit but dick and nuts
(Too $hort)
Yeah baby... I always respect the game
That's why bitches, always let me hit that thang
I hit it good, I hardly ever keep in touch
Top notches, it's hard to believe I fuck
But I did it, every time I see her I get it
I know you heard Short Dawg got digits
Don't forget it, I'm all about the pimp shit
I ain't no sucker with a limp dick
(Chyna)
Fuck the dumb shit, niggaz they come quick
9th Ward bitches always get they cunt licked
You know the game, if you get a hoe it's probably from the fame
Ugly niggaz pretty bitches you know the aim
I got niggaz with my name tatted on they chest
And I don't give a fuck about another bitch 'cause I'm the best
Picture Chyna long mink in a stretch
Back to back with a Lex, lettin off tecs, ya heard me?
Chorus: Too $hort + Chyna White

What what game recognize game baby
What what all my thugs let 'em hang baby

It's a quarter to 3, whatchu gon' do shorty?
Choose on a player or roll with a square
I'm tryin' to holla at you, fuck them hoes over there
I wish I could get you outside in my truck
Put my hang between your legs maybe then I'll fuck
You know whassup, I'ma see you next time
Droppin' sex lines, so I can fuck one time
(Chyna)
Nigga how many times you done seen ""The Mack?""
How many times you gon' think with your sac
Then talk with your genitals?
I run with strictly criminals
Top notch bitches, in drop top sixes
I'm from New Orleans, where bitches put shit in your greens
Bury your drawers, shatter your dreams, make you stop eatin
Cabbage and beans, dolla dolla what them know 'bout the cream
And fuck the worl cause it ain't what it seems (ya heard?)

You know us Oakland niggaz still pimp to this day
Still wear perms with big old waves
Three or four hoes in a mini-van
Ridin' round tryin' to get all I can
When you see ""The Mack,"" you see my town
If hoes get money we'll be around
Talkin' that punk bitch out her chips
Please believe me, don't doubt the shit
I'm still pimpin'... let it ride"
180,Rhymes,1988,Life Is... Too $hort (1988),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Without a doubt I'm comin' back and if you don't know
Call me S. I. R. T. double O
I like to say these rhymes, I do it all the time
I make my own damn beat now all the money is mine
I carry big fat WIVES, I treat my girls like guys
Ask 'em ""who do they love?"" and they all say TIDE
I'm just an M.C. rapper and nothin' else
I keep rhymin' and I do it by myself
Could you be like me? I rap my none stop rhymes
You will never hear pause when I say these lines
So go on and on, I'm sir Too $hort
Just what you've been lookin' for
Like PCP or pure cocaine
DJ universe got you SPRUNG IN THE GAME
You make money, hear my rap from coast to coast
From host to host, I hear the toast:
""Too $hort, love the way you that hit
Here's to you, keep rhymin' and boy don't quit""
I say This is how it goes when I say my rap
Most times when I rhyme wouldn't be like that
'Cause the way I write rhymes you will comprehend
I'll keep rappin' to the very end
And if you call me fake I'll say so what?
I got you standin' and noddin' like you just shot up
So boy straightin' up I'm still rappin'
Comin' at you fresh. Do you know what happened?
I'm sayin' rhymes messin' with your mind
I didn't want your girl 'cause she really ain't fine
I took her to a motel could've been a hotel
It costs me 20 dollars but I did it so well
She had to tell your sister, your sister told you
Now the whole damn town calls me playboy too
I got rhymes, keep 'em comin', they don't stop
I'm lookin' at an empty page about to fill it up
I write only the truth, speak only to you
So if I tell you to say somethin' then you know what to do
I got rhymes, keep 'em comin', they never stop
I live in California, drive a drop top
Roll by the beach, look at the freaks
Jump in my car, I do it every week
DJ's who know call me Mister Short
All you wanna be mothers get no child support
I'm Too $hort baby gettin' rich
Get on the mic and then say... Like left to right
Right to left girl stealin' your heart is like petty theft
Like 10 to 9, 3 to 2
I'll always be one up on you
Like nightfall makes the sun go down
CRAZY RACK laid the beat changed your life around
From the sea to the mountains the mountains to the sea
All you're gonna do is wanna rock this beat
It's so rough so tough when I talk this stuff
When I get on the mic I can't get enough
I'm the rapper of the season, fresh and decent
All my raps are smooth and decent
I'm that rapper known place to place
For the hardest raps with the hardest bass
You see I rap all the time, that's the point
When I walk in the place I just jam the joint
Singin' old Too $hort's on the microphone
The beat's so fresh can't leave me alone
You see I rap so cool I will not shout
I keep comin' so hard I might knock you out
If you battle with Short that's the chance you take
So you better come fresh and don't be fake
All you weak MC's with your weak drum beats
Tellin' all your people you can hang with me
Count 1 to 10 count 10 to 20 and I'll just keep on makin' money
Life is Too $hort I don't stop
I'm hooked on money like a junkie on TOP
I got to make it every day, I won't go broke
Ask me am I rich and I'll say ""no""
I'm your homeboy Too $hort back again
Puttin' Oakland on the map my rap will never end
I'd like to send a special thanks to the dangerous crew
For believin' in me when they thought I was through
I got rhymes, I keep 'em comin'
I'm on the mic, I won't stop rappin' till it comes out right
And when it's BEATIN' I'll just say ""let's roll""
I make another record and buy some gold
I keep rhymin' and I do it by myself
I'm like a one man crew, you see I don't need help
I get the job done so all you fake rappers, MC's rap masters
Give it up leave that rappin' to me
Realizin' young buck you can't rock that beat
I rap on the mic and you'll believe
Nothin' ain't kickin' like the BIG OLD C
It's just one hard rapper spittin' a rap
Not 3 or 4 sucka's or a couple of saps
Like born to Mack I'll cash a check
Walkin' 'round like a fool livin' up to his rep
I'll tell you life ain't long

182,Sample the Funk,1995,Cocktails (1995),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Sup?
Short Dogg back in the house beeyatch!
And it don't stop to the beat
Ain't no thang but a chicken wing
We gonna do it like this one mo' time
Straight from Oakland, California I'm back again
Short Dogg's on the mic 'bout to mack and pimp
We got flavor at the Dangerous Crew camp
Save ya money, can't use dem food stamps
Other crews like to sample and mix
But our crew, we just play that shit
Live, drums, bass, keys
Niggas don't like it, you can get bees
Stuck in the back of your throat
Fuckin' with a pimp named Sir Too $hort
We coulda sampled the Luke but we didn't
I'd rather treat ya like a ho and start pimpin'
When will you other brothers realise?
Can't fuck with my crew better feel your eyes
'Cause you must be blind if you can't see
And I'ma say this shit quite frankly
I give a fuck when freestylers step up
I don't do it, tell you 'bout it on the next cut
'Cause right now we gotta feel the flow
And make sure we keep it real slow
Just like the motherfuckin Dangerous Crew
We gettin' funky like it's 1972
Still puffin on them zags, dressed like pimps
And axe Ohio Players once again
Can we sample the funk?
Y'know we don't wanna wear it out
We just wanna lil' piece, y'knowhati'msayin?
We ain't goin' loopy, we're goin' freaky
We gonna funk it track for track
Dangerous Crew style
Ant Banks let me flip this one more time
Ya ready?
All you brand new rappers got a new flow
You ain't samplin James Brown no mo'
Probably try to sample cameo
Parliament Funkadelic, you scandalous ho
You stole it, Ossie Brothers, Bark Kays
Barry White, Isaac Hayes
Have you heard the term 'Sample Clearance'?
Start the nigga who wrote it, would never hear it
Now we're suin your ass for sure
Got'cha spendin all ya money 'cause you need a lawyer
You got problems and ya need ta solve em
Ya shouldn't of sampled wouldn't of had dem problems
If you'd have played your own shit
You wouldn't be broke, you woulda made ya long grip, bitch
But that's irrelevant now, my friend
'Cause they done wiped you clean like Ant Banks' Benz
Sittin' on some three-piece AMG's
Better find you a sample, you ain't playin' these
Kinda beats, so funky make your fingers pop
If you can't find a sample you ain't got
Not one damn thing for a nigga to ride to
But I been gettin' funky since I was in high school
Growin' up in that Bootsy's rubber band
In '76, seen a mothership land
Nothin' but funk all in your face
I like to slow it way down in ass and bass
'Cause that's how we be layin tracks
Just flip the funky rhyme and start sayin' raps
Get funky with Ant Banks, PeeWee, Shorty B
Father D, Dope D, Tony T
The motherfuckin Dangerous Crew
And that's the drop from the dime, we'll change the groove
Just to sample the funk
Beeyatch!
That's right, PeeWee friggin the keyboards
Tony T on the drums, Shorty B on the bass
Ant Banks on the mixing boards, Short Dogg on the vocals
Right now you know the story of Too $hort baby
First started rappin' in 1980
I got more game than Monopoly
Now I'm makin' money there ain't nobody stoppin' me
Used to be local till I signed with Jive, man
Used to like to sample now I'm rollin' with live band
Now that I finally did this shit
I'm makin' one more album and then I quit
And only one thing could make me say I'm not
And that's one million dollars on the spot
Upfront cash, money, no compromise
No schemes, no scandals, don't front and lie
Just pay the man in full
Thirty years old, torch the bull
Ain't givin' shit up but the funk
Let these record companies know what the fuck I want
'Cause they been fuckin' black folks right from the start
When you sign that line tear your ass apart
For every one you get they gettin' five
Niggas gettin' paid but it don't seem right
I know where I came from and know where I'm at
And my last two albums don't sound real bad
I'm Too $hort baby, I ain't no punk
I'm just askin 'Can I sample the funk?'
So can we sample the funk?
Bitch!
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm talkin' to George Clinton, Bootsy Collins
My nigga Suga Foot and Diamond from the Ohio Players
I'm talkin' to James Brown
We know where the funk came from
Johnny 'Guitar' ????
To all y'all niggas, y'all can sample all you want
Here we go loopty-loo

183,Set Up,2002,What's My Favorite Word? (2002),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"One... two... one, two, three, four
First we got the crack
Then we got the gats
Then they changed all the laws
It was a set up
Lockin all the young homies up
Gettin' 'em all shot dead in the streets
Straight set up
I remember when the world went crazy
Crack cocaine, hit the streets in the 80's
Right before the crack they was smokin' fat
They called it freebase and rich folks did that (that's right)
It's all good, but nobody in the hood
Put powder in water and cooked it, they never would (naw)
A white boy did it, showed niggaz how to get it
The rich man's high got the ghetto addicted
It used to be expensive, fuck that ten shit
Turnin' out cute little bitches that was innocent
Five years later, she to' up from the flo' up (be-itch)
Niggaz used to kiss her, now the bitch smell like throw-up
(Hoe) What? I'm tellin' the truth
The man had a plan that was killin' the youth
You can smoke it, or sell it, if you choose you lose
It was a set up, got everybody singin' the blues
They gave you the crack to start flippin your sack
You makin' your money, it's sittin' in stacks (yeah)
You bought you some gats, for niggaz who jack
Put a 50 in the crib, motherfucker bag that (nigga what?)
Somebody died, you're goin' to war
You got a lot of straps and you want some more
You in the little leagues, AK's from the Middle East
Guns and coke, you wanna get a piece?
It was a set up, that's what the O.G.'s say
I heard Rick got his dope from the CIA
A new kind of baller out in sunny Los Angeles
Benzes, houses, young niggaz havin' this
Oakland got a taste and all over the place
Detroit to Miami they was rollin' case
Down to I-75, whatchu need in Atlanta
White Christmas, a bag full of dope like Santa
(Whatchu need homey whatchu need?) It was a set up
(I got whatchu need baby, I got whatever you need)
(You got the money? I got the llello)
Don't look in his eyes, use your automatic weapons
Shoot in the crowd and keep steppin (that's yo' ass)
Read about it later, wrong nigga got hit
Shot a gangster in the leg, but you killed a little kid
Now where in the fuck did the guns come from?
They used to put 'em up and say you want some?
Now you get shot, makin' all that loud noise (nigga)
Have your pistol on your side like the cowboys (beotch)
Cause you can make a lot of money when you sellin dope
Sell your soul to the devil, say to hell with the Pope
At the Benz dealer (yeah I want that one) spend a hundred thousand cash
You feelin' like a hoe, money comin' out your ass
In a way, it's not your fault
You stupid as fuck, that's why you got caught
You never get out, and I'm still amazed
You shoulda opened up a biz and bought some real estate
(I'm havin' money) Niggaz strapped like the military
Know how to cook it, package it and get it there
You get paid? You coulda been a CPA
When you weigh that yay, tell the DEA
It ain't mine (it ain't mine) I don't wanna do no time
They got the new laws havin' niggaz snitchin and lyin'
'Cause what we do y'all we gotta get our own hustle
I'm cool on the coke, I don't want no trouble (fuck that)
I got a felony (one strike) I was caught in a bust
Got probation, they can't stop us (unstoppable)
I got two gat cases and I still ain't been to jail
They caught my little homey on the hill and made him tell
He told about the murders and the whole operation (shit)
I feel like the slave, on a plantation
Now I'm stuck in here, and don't wanna stay
I wish I was a kid so I could go out and play
(They set me up man) It was a set up..."

But I like the way she suck my dick
I know she know I'm a dogg
But I like the way she licks my balls
Man can she suck a dick or what!?!?!
She's got me knocking over shit,
Waking them up her fat ass kids up,
I'm telling them to go back to bed,
I'm sitting here reminiscing on this bomb ass head
The whole time got a nigga stuck for real
I'm having real visions of busting one on her grill
She craves for my nut in her leranix after me you gotta do
My homeboy Uncircumcised Lex"

(Too $hort)
Are you in heaven, or is it real life
Cause ain't nobody ever made you feel like
You can't get enough it, you keep wantin more
Ever since you was young, you felt the need to explore
Baby girl youse a natural, you can't hide it
The way you put that strap on, and let her ride it
Gave her multiple orgasms, witcha vibrator
All five flavors tasted like Life Savors
I know you love her, everything about her
Laid in the bed, you sprinkled baby powder, on the sheets
Smilin', kissin' down her spine
Climbed over, and then y'all did the 69
Cause her touch, is nothin' like your man's
Soft as a baby when her butt is in yo' hands
And she does, so many different things
Make yo' body start shakin almost instantly
{*Women's voices moaning in ecstasy*}
[$Hort] She loves her
{*Women's voices*}
[$Hort] She's lovin' her
{*Women's voices*}
[$Hort] I know you love her

[$Hort] She's lovin' it

Sunshine in your life, hope it lasts forever
No bad weather, got her ass on the dresser
Lookin' so good, she got you so wet
You might be switchin up the good but you don't know yet
It's a brand new experience, you knew the day would come
Find you a girl, and get you some
If it's her first time, I bet you can't tell
'Cause she got down on her knees and licked that thang well
And when you taste her, you can't replace her
Smooth like Remi X-O with no chaser
You look in the mirror, and see your own reflection
Face in her thighs, with no long erection
{*Women's voices moaning in ecstasy*}
[$Hort] She loves her

[$Hort] She loves her
{*Women's voices*}
[$Hort] I know you love her

[$Hort] She's lovin' it

I saw it in her eyes, I could tell the way she smiled
She's thought about these things, it's been a long while
She wants to play witchu, if you can be alone
She turned the radio on to play her favorite song
She didn't take ex pills, smoke weed or drink
Just take your clothes off, and let her kiss that thing
Don't be scared, I see you gettin' down like that
On your stomach while you run your tongue around that cat
Y'all can be the Mary Jane Girls, ""All Night Long""
Play the radio with nuttin but the hall light on
It don't stop, juices flowin like a stream
With no man in between, feels like a dream

{*Women's voices*}

How you gonna step up when you let them little heffers
Dig in your pocket while they suckin' on your left nut
You a soldier? Nigga I'm a vet, what?
I'm old school with a new style
Girls hear me rap and act too wild
But that's how I like 'em, what you wanna do now?
Get you all alone girl and turn you out
You want a man that do all he can
Hold your hand and take you to the promised land
But I refuse to help you get there
Good luck, I hope you choose on the best player

I'm all in your ear tellin' you the wrong thing
But you listen anyway, buyin' the dream
You know about us pimps, we be lyin' and things
I don't wanna fight for the bitch Joe
It's all about the game and who can spit the most
I'm never too faded to hustle
Ball up my fists and make the muscle
I stay strapped, I don't wanna tussle
Fake ass bodyguard niggas wanna wrestle

She's goin' hella stupid on this hyphy beat
And now you wanna fight with me?
Make me mad and I'ma fuck your wife to be
I'm from the Eastside where the Raiders play
Where you get your game from? I say the Bay
You think I'll square up? You can't be hopin'

I fucked her a few times then dumped her
You tricks, always tryin' to find you a better hoe
I told you never put the pussy on a pedestal

I make the beats for me and my homies
Newspaper reporters and others always ask me
Why I'm x-rated and I rap so nasty
When I was a teen I did nothing else
But pick up a pen and express myself
The things I wrote were obsene and kind of dirty
But mama always said the truth couldn't hurt me
She also said that it would set me free
I guess she was r-i-g-h-t on the nail
Cause now I'm out making my mail
It all started out from a freaky tale
If that's what sells then I'm a stick with it
Short dog ain't changing, so forget it
You can sell out if you want to, homie
But I'm a stay short but funky
Don't stop, just call it verse two
It's short dog baby from the dangerous crew
Not your average everyday fake rap on the micro
I might say something that your mother don't like so
Don't play it loud if she's around to see
But you can play this 'cause it's rated pg
When I'm rated x I'm just having my fun
I bring a smile to each and every one
But there's a serious side in everything I say
Life is too short for you to wait till the next day
Just straighten up your life and you can start right here
Drop the cocaine and the bottles of beer
People always say it ain't right to preach
But take my advice, get wise and reach for the sky
So you can live like a king homie
And I'm a stay short but funky
You never catch me on the mic rappin' a dance tune
I like it kind of mellow with the sound of the bass boom
The style is mine, I've been doing it for ten
You might say it's simple, but I'm making my ends
See I don't trip on a punk 'cause I jack him
Too $hort plus the cuss words equals platinum
What would I look like dancing on a stage
I wave my hand and do it like the old days
But some dumb fool want to take it out of hand
With 50 million dancers and a big old band
That ain't me, I'm from the old school
Play the instrumental, get the mic and I'm cool
'Cause I'm an oaktown mack and it's like that, so
It all comes out in my records and my stage show
In my category I'm the one and only
And I'm a stay short but funky

In cinncinatti, I know you heard
I got fined for the cusswords
It's true, baby, so so unique
Might slap your man, or just thump your freak

I know baby it's such a pity

Cold macking in the game is all we do
Me and the boys called the dangerous crew
I used to be local till I signed with jive
Too $hort then went nationwide
I went to georgia with the too $hort sound
I went down like bobby brown
I said a rap and they took me to jail
Pulled out my bank, and made bail
This is my story, it could not wait
It all started out in the golden state
California, where I was born and raised
I used to play the drum in my younger days
I just hit that beat any way I can
Smooth high-stepping in the marching band
I turned in my drum and I started to rap
Now beats I make, make my bank so fat

I'm riding shotgun, rapping for real
Total boss in the back, give me superside
They like to roll 'em fat cause you know we ride
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on 'cause I don't stop rapping
Now you know, nothing but the dog in me
You make love to me and I still act stingy
Oh should I pay you? you must be tripping
I didn't buy you and I sure ain't renting
I said I love you cause you gave me head
I didn't love you when we got out the bed
If I could love you, you know I would
But what you giving, ain't all that good
A little southern hospitality
You'd better try to get away from me
I love money, and I just can't fake it
I go to magic city and the girls dance naked
I'm somewhat of a hero by the way I rap
But I'm living like an oaktown mack
I'm in the house y'all, I'm like ? peeser? y'all
Rat heads get nothing but cheese, y'all
Or get slapped, put up your dukes
I kick you in your ass with my nike boots
Some rappers try to be just like too $hort
Can hang with the dog, you'd better stay on the porch
In minnesota, virginia beach
Wisconson, I got freaks
Atlanta, little rock
Louisville, it don't stop
Kansas city, missouri
I rock the house in east st. louis
Detroit, it's like oakland
It's a black thing, and I'm a black man
To all my brothers in the u.s.a.
Too $hort baby don't even play
Woofers in the trunk, blasting the beat
I cross the bridge and hit 3rd street
Years ago, I rocked that joint
I say what's up to my homies from hunter's point
We go a long way back, it's always been like that
In the days that short dog was so young at the rap
I'm in the house!
Moving up! east oakland, yeah that's right (repeat 4x)"

My real friends know
I always try to find me a woman
But everywhere I go
Bitches try to slide me something
Now listen up, I try to make it quick
I tell you about my greatest hits
My latest flick, was a porno
'Cause I reached that level
I fulfilled all my fantasies
I passed several... beautiful women
I'm a thrill seeker, a pro player
My speciality is ex cheerleaders
Dancers, gymnasts, and ballerinas
They all hot like some halapenos
If I released the names and pictures
Of all the bitches
Drop everything you doing
And call the missus
She was young when she met me
So don't hate her
I'm an entertainer
And a master manipulator
Short Dog let them know [What?]

Way before you knew your bitch
She's kinda fast
I still wanna do your bitch
Take a chance, sit down and have a seat
You know the saying 'don't bring your girl round me'
Did you think my greatest hits was gonna be some songs?
Nope, just some stories about a bunch of thongs
Fo sho
She's the type that you haad to marry
You walked in the room and said Halle Berry
That's what she looked like
So I put my thing up in her, rolled over and said good night
When I woke up in the morning, she looked the same
So I did the same thing to her, hooked her mayn
I hit her two best friends first
That's what I did
She heard I was good in bed
That's what they said

From 14-41, 4'11-6 feet
Lil mama was a big freak
The 6 footer had her time with me
I got some supermodel head on miami beach
Then I fingerfucked the woman on the plane next to me
When it landed, the flight attendant had sex with me
And they ask 'is it the pimp in you?'
I hit reporters morning after interviews
Checking in, lil cutie at the front desk
All in my face, lookin' like she wants this
Later on, she asks me to play her a song
Getting nasty in my room with her uniform on
I been with roommates, sisters, EVEN twins
Next door neighbours ??? and best friends

You be hard as hell, take whatever you want
Punk suckers wanna front -- they get done
Cause you a gangster -- nuttin more nuttin less
Put my boy to the test and catch one in your chest
Since he was young, homeboy won't back down
Cause real gangsters, always hold that frown
Until you lose control, then you sell your soul
To the devil motherfucker 'cause you're way too cold
And all the people hide and just run inside
Cause you keep usin' yo' gat committin homicide
Boy I tell ya, life is way too $hort
Another brother just got smoked
And you killed him -- ain't that a bitch?

Gangsters don't live that long
I had gangster potnahs get they heads to' off
For some of that gangster shit, get caught in the cross
You want stripes, take yo' ass to the service
'Cause when it's on, ain't no time to get nervous
Pull the trigger... yeah you did it
You'se a gangster and I got to admit it
But you'se a youngbuck... you ain't learned yet

Get out the fast line -- stick with the homeboys
Ready made gangster get gone boy
'Cause where I'm from it's the same old shit
You call them shots, when you're down with the click
Niggaz dyin' everyday but that's a black thang
You either sell dope, or your gangbang
But you got the biggest heart in the click man
You did a murder, and now you're a hitman
All your homies tryin' to tell you, that ain't cool
Playin' shoot 'em up, like a fuckin' fool
But you'se a gangster, one they can't destroy
Don't even give a fuck, about your boys
You go for self, you wanna be on top?

I got the gin and juice and I'm a poor 'em cup
To get smooth in the mood that I'm in
So lets start riding till this mother fucker ends
And hit the main strip, where the hoes be hanging
Spitting some game and trying to throw that thang
On any young nigga with some ends
A mobile phone and a drop top benz
Take it from me, see, 'cause I know what it's about
Kick a big fat dick in a bitches mouth
And keep riding, high siding, but don't front
Nigga serve that shit, don't be no punk
And while the niggaz keep jocking, I be scoping
All the fine ass freaks of Oakland
That's where I reside, and where I always will be
The city of killers, dope dealers and still we
Chill like players, and act like pimps
Mack all hoes and slap all simps
The big badass, I'm from the Dangerous Crew
I just hang with the gang like it's the thang to do
Now motherfuckers can't face the facts that I'm doing this
Rapping and producing and they can't even ruin this
See everybody knows the Banksta
The big dick gangsta who's fucking with dank and clocking the bank
And I'm a get mine in the 9 O's
I mean the money, the fame, and the and the big thick fine hoes
I'm pulling up right beside you
Bumping this funky ass shit to ride to
Now here's some shit for you to ride to punk
Fifteen's slammin' hard in my god damn trunk
From tenth ave, to a hundred and fifth
Young players ride the foothill strip
They ride Chevys, Cougars, Blazers, Vettes
Five 60 Benzos with Ferrari kits
They love fine ass bitches, rolex watch
Top let down on the coke white drop
I love my high schools cuties, muscle bound booties
Pools a hoes so you know I had to do my duties
I got to have it like a rabbit, fuck her like a champ
I tell you nigga I'm a pro with these high school tramps
They say young minds, make good times
See I'm a player so let me give an O 9
Alicia, Tina, Marie, and Evette
She wanna ride punk bitch you can ride my dick
Now Shawnetta, Shawnda, an Rida too
Now here's a shot to the whole slug crew
Talk bad punk bitch but it's always Pooh
Kiss my ass and spend your cash, on this shit to ride to
Push in my deck, put in the key and start the engine
'Cause I ain't joking, tired of smoking donuts while I'm spinning
A tight high performance engine with the duals and cams
Fuck a spare tire in my trunk, it's boom, that slams
'Cause I'm a young brotha like to burn rubber yo, get in and out of lanes
I pump that ride in your bumper so ya change
Then I take a pit stop, exterior/interior whipped up
They wax me, then they buff me, niggaz don't love me now I'm tipped out
Now I'm coming fresh from the detail shop
Going to the lee-male spots, looking for the female cock
I feel the bass and woofer kick my chest like a heartbeat
Went to the curb, when I saw the ass of a dark freak
So I pulled up slamming $hort Dawg
I said ""Hey"", she said [snort], I said, ""Damn a fuckin' warthog!""
So I smashed out doing 90
Covered her ass up with the smoke I left behind me
The medley steadily flowed in my ears like oxygen
Too $hort, the Pooh, and the Banks, got the hoes on our jocks again
Fucking with the hooties, with booties, and big titties
That's potent, but all I got is cheese for a rodent
Got a ticket doing 60 in a school crossing
Picking up my young cock for some cool tossing
Defamation of character, racially slandering
But all I'm ever guilty of is pimping and pandering
So please let me go officer
Because I could be at home in my bed tossing her
I make like al, tune, crank the vol-ume, and dash
Hit the freeway 'cause I can't play when I got some ass
Respect a player and an O G that's what they told me
Mhisani nickname Goldy, spittin' shit to ride to
Now I come from the mother fucking eastside
So shut the fuck up bitch and just ride
I'm Short Dogg, hoe you can't front me
Since my very first album I was funky
Bitches start seeing them dollar signs
Even though I wouldn't give a broke bitch one dime
It's kind of funny, they want money from a pimp
Bitch, you couldn't get 50 cents
I take a gap from your ass and then I owe you the rest
I know the game hoe, and I'm a vet
Playing broads ain't based on love
You want my money, I wanna fuck
And after we do all that, I talk about you in my next rap
Beyotch! Kiss my pimping ass
Cause all the time I didn't have this cash
Wouldn't call, wouldn't give me your number
I couldn't see ya like Stevie Wonder
I made a hit record, now I got money
You wanna play $hort Dogg for a dummy
But I come from the mother fucking eastside
You suck my dick so I let the fake bitch ride
Dangerous music is on the mike
And like Banks always say, ""This shit is tight""
Now that's some shit I ride
Pop that in the K-5 and go, buuuut
I got my partner Ant Banks sittin' on something real phat
I got my partner Short, sittin' on the hood of a Cadillac
I got eveybody rolling
I got Kool-Aid, he ain't spilling and he ain't trippin'
I got Ol' T B with his big 'ol fat ass, I got everybody
I got ?, but he ain't got no skin on his dick 'cause he fuck too much
I got ah, I got Ol' Dirty Arm but that my partna though
'Cause he's super clean, super side, super everything
I got Footy and Jerry, he trying to dred, but that ain't what's happening
I got a, shit who else I got, I got I got Face, Pooh, that's my partna
He'll look through a broad his face so big
I got ah, I got Pow Pow, he looking like Linus; he kind of filthy
But that's my partna though, I ain't going to talk bad
I ain't going to talk bad
No I ain't going to rank out
Oh Kitty Wing, that's my partna Peppermint Patty
I ain't going to talk about him
I ain't going to talk about Huh
'Cause he might beat me up send the block out on me
I don't want the block to through on me
Oh Too Clean [barking sounds]
We got ah, we got Hist Dancers (what about Chris Hicks baby?)
Chris Hicks that's my that my Steven Seagal, he living lavish
Oh else we got, who else we got in the crew that you want me to rank on
The Tin Man Mo, that's Pah prince of Darkness, that's my dark partna

You wastin' time waitin' on some n***
'Cause if you catch me and you're tryin' to impress me
Ain't nothin' more sexy than a
Sophisticated, educated
That's what I get from you
That's what I see in you
You spoke the latest, fly young lady
Do what you wanna do
That's why I f*** with you
Call me after work
I see the little cuties, I don't have to flirt
You never have to question all the stuff I do
'Cause they don't look, cook or f*** like you
You's a real one, don't fight the feelin'
Let's do it all night, up by the ceilin'
I just want some lovin', I don't wanna fight
You don't want a husband, I don't want a wife
I spend nights at yo' house, you can stay at mine
Wake up and go home when it's daytime
You ain't all up under me, a pimp oughta know
With your Benz and your penthouse condo
And your fly a*** fits, diamonds and whips
You're damn near leavin' me and I'm in the six
You just like your car, sexy and fast
I'll put the pedal to the metal, I'ma catch yo' a***
Sophisticated, educated
That's what I get from you
That's what I see in you
You spoke the latest, fly young lady
Do what you wanna do
That's why I f*** with you
Too $hinzzle, Jazzy Phinzzel
You what I like about you, baby?
You got your toes done, you got your make-up right
You got it all, baby, you're sophisticated
You don't live with your mother"
201,Step Daddy,1992,Shorty the Pimp  (1992),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Step daddy, I know what you want
I come through like the first of the month
Ain't nothing but a holiday
When I fuck my way
I'm her worst nightmare, her wettest dream
We always do that freaky thing
And when I'm coming to her house
I know just what she's all about
Don't waste no time, get in it
Keep on humping till my head starts spinning
Whoop that ass like a world champ
Break the chairs and knock down the lamp
In my birthday suit, dripping wet
No I ain't tripping how freaky it get
Feeling that sweat on my eyebrow
Nothing can't stop me but nature now
Fucking your bitch like them pros do
Something you can't get close to
Born to mack in my drop-top caddy
Just call me step daddy (repeat 3x)
How many mothers in the house tonight, ladies?
How many daddies take care of them babies?
They got to learn to take care of their own
Getting girls pregnant and leaving 'em alone
Fine little bitches, way too young
Met short dog and then gave him some
So why you keep talking about the pg&e?
When all she ever wanted was a man like me
To come through, and do that thang
Step daddy in the house, and I got game
So lock your back doors, check your hoes
Suck on the pussy and lick them toes
Step daddy coming through like a porno flick
Freak the bitch, now she loves my dick
She let me bust big nuts all in her mouth
And s.d. turned the bitch out
Just call me step daddy (repeat 4x)
Gold-digging bitches in the city of dope
Got it going on like a daytime soap
She's so freaky, she'll make you shout
One on the way and got two at the house
Three different daddies, and all is well
As long as them brothers keep making mail
And it's cool, when I come through
Play step daddy for a minute or two
And then fuck her, that's how it's done
It's not my daughter and it's not my son
So what if your kids start tearing shit up
I really don't give a fuck
I never get mad about the shit they break
When I'm around, we eat steak
I let the motherfuckers act bad
Buy 'em toys when they're crying and sad
Could you be 'em? your baby's momma
Turns me on in her freaky pajamas
I come through and make the whole house happy
Just call me step daddy (repeat 3x)
Get freaky, and do it wild
On the floor, doggy style
I get rugburns, on my knees
While your bitch be crying please
Don't stop so I don't
I fuck her like I know you won't
Pull out my dick and make her lose hope
Stick it back in and make her take some notes
If that's your bitch, homeboy you'd better keep her
'Cause she won't stay off my beeper
You can't fuck her and I appreciate it
Even though I know you hate it
I keep getting that good shit
S.d. wanna fuck your bitch
Come through and make the hoe so happy
Just call me step daddy (repeat 2x)"

Yeah I still smoke
Still blowin'

I don't need navigation, I know where to go
85 on the highway blowin' the 'dro
Move out the way if you goin' too slow
My dick's in her mouth, let a hoe be a hoe
'Cause I flip 'em like pancakes
I smoke weed like Scoot and Band-Aid
Comin' back, from Humboldt County
All I blow is kush, I don't want no brown weed
So light it up, let's get it on
I smoked a lot of purp but that shit is strong
You can buy it on the turf, that's whassup
But niggaz like me hit the cannabis club
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
I only shop at the weed store
Smoked it all up now I need some more
That's what I do - what you ain't knowin'?
I got/bought some O.G. kush and I'm still blowin'
(Too $hort)
Ain't nothin' changed I'm still blowin' the purp
Ridin' in my car, goin' to work
My clothes are wreakin, but fuck the smell!
You can say what you want nigga I cain't tell
I smoke half on the way, the other half later
Receptionist flirtin with me, I don't wanna date her
I just wanna hit, and sleep with the slut
We can smoke and fuck but don't keep in touch
She got a sexy body, yeah she's a hottie
She's a nymphomaniac, nasty and naughty
I'm wit'chu girl, if you say so
She gave me a massage and I gave her a facial
(Too $hort)
I just spent 28 days in rehab
Weed and alcohol, I need it bad
Shit won't help - I've quit before
Didn't take too long for me to hit some more
I used to smoke Newports but I had to stop
I even used to smoke my weed with rocks
My square girlfriends said I need to stop
But I'm hooked on weed like it's hop, bitch!
And I don't need no poppy seed
No coca leaf, or no PCP
All I need is some good-ass weed
Keep the styrofoam cup, you can have that E
(Chorus - first half only)
(Too $hort)
Don't be mad at me
Cause you a stupid motherfucker you don't have to be
Fuck the peer pressure - what you ain't knowin'?
You can do you Mr. Kush and keep blowin'
Beotch!
Still blowin'
Got that O.G. kush
Yeah man we ain't never gon' stop smokin'

Survivin' the game man, it ain't easy when
You out here for uh ten years hanging with the cut-throats
Back stabbers, playa haters y'know what I'm sayin'?
But I'm a bitch killa always was, and always will be
If you ain't in the right state of mind don't play with me
'Cause they ain't never ended slavery
You fuckin' with my freedom, let's keep it real fool
Don't underestimate niggaz who'll kill you
Cause everything changed, and everybody got a strap
Don't wanna be attacked keep it on your lap
I'm smobbing in my drop, smiling like priest
Superfly top down speeding through the streets
Killas on the prowl, and jacking is how
They get paid pull out a gat and break your ass down
Nigga show no fear, but you scared as hell
And your partner riding with you is prepared to tell
But you don't know it yet, you havin' hella fun
And when the shit hit the fan and you on the run
You better pray if they catch your homeboy first
'Cause if they put him under pressure, he bound to burst
Into a long conversation bout everything you did
No more tusslin, time to do a bid
In the brand new jail that they built for you
Where the smallest little thing you get killed over
(Survivin' the game)
Ain't to bailin' out, you mad as hell
Instead of send you to school, they keep you in jail
That cost way more, when you do time
When you creep through the hood and kill your own kind
They building county jails, and penitentiaries
They gettin' ready for the motherfucking 21st century
Computers taking over, money's obsolete
Now they buying all the houses in the ghetto streets
They way we live now, we can't last long
Cause everyday niggaz gettin' they blast on
Funerals and court dates, plea bargain for your life
You'll be out in twelve years, once a month see your wife
Now how that sound?
You killed the black man, now they got you locked down
They let you learn a trade, working years for pennies
And that shit you building, was making white man plenty
Got the game fucked up, and you'll never be rich
It's all about respect and they treat you like a bitch
(Survivin' the game)
I was born with the skills of a black man
To survive in the streets and keep stackin'
I'm thirty years old, and far from done
I don't care what you think, I ain't forgot where I'm from
East Oakland / and that's where I learned
Everything I know, and when I got my turn
I never came fake on a microphone
I always let 'em know that the town is home
I wasn't born in Oakland, I was born a mack
Stay true to the game, always stating the facts
Bitch you can't stop my mack attack
I know you love this shit, when I rap like that
You never would get me to change my style
I spent 20 million dollars on a brand new house
I got bills to pay, no time to be fake
Eating top rump don't fuck with steak
Don't be jealous of me, 'cause it's well known
I could slip in a minute after hella songs
Make one fake album and I'm through
I be a broke ass nigga like you
So I just try to stay focused and do my job
Turn that shit up loud and watch a bitch head bob
'Cause I'm the too s-h-o-r-t
I take a square ass bitch and turn her into a freak
(Survivin' the game)
Now growing old in the streets ain't no easy task
Losing homeboys every time the season pass
Gettin' phone calls, another soldier dead
Sittin' in the car got four in the head
Rush to his mama house the shit is real
Trying to find out why a nigga got killed
I'm about to hurt somebody, give a fuck who
Cause you already know what you need to do
Kill another black man that's what you figure
Just what we need, another dead nigga
Got your guns you don't want none
You stupid motherfucker where they come from
From the white man, get 'em like fast food
With an attitude to make a nigga blast you
You little violent motherfucker don't play with me
'Cause they ain't never ended slavery fuckin' with my freedom

And it don't stop to the beat baby
Now take my bitch, she won't complain about shit
'Cause I taught her well, she got game for a trick
It ain't hard to tell she belongs to me,
I pimped her 15 years in this industry
Now her pussy so big I don't want no mo',
But she still down wit me 'cause I raised that ho
Found a bitch in East Oakland broke silly and young,
Don't let her fool ya playa, she ain't really dumb
Don't be a sucka and give an old ho new life,
She got so much game ya wanna make her your wife
>From California all the way to Miami,
I pimped that bitch and now the hoes can't stand me
'Cause when I put my bitch on the streets,
Niggas rush to the store 'cause they love the beats
We gettin' all the money, we cashin' all the checks,
I ain't no fake pimp nigga you can take my bitch
*DJ scratching ""Now take my bitch"" *
Now do ya think I get mad when you sport my bitch around town,
Never that, cause my bitch is so down
I could send her to Hawaii or out to Nevada,
It really don't matta, my pockets get fatta
Used to go to Las Vegas in the early-eighties snortin' Coke,
Tryin' to turn the ladies on to $hort
It was my destiny to pimp these hoes,
(Beyotch) Whole crowd screamin loud at my shows
I've been to every last city with the Dangerous Crew,
And everywhere I went the bitch came through
Makin' money like a real good whore,
Tell 'em whos your pimp bitch, ""Too $hort""
On a ten week run back in eighty-nine,
I flipped a brand new Benz, the bitch was so fine
If you want that ho, you can have that bitch,
She won't complain about shit
*DJ scratching ""Now take my bitch"" *
Now take my bitch, the kind of bitch all pimps want,
But if you slip and ya pockets get small ya get done
You got to stay up, fuck tryin' to come up,
Get your mind off the pussy, always tryin' to run up
Cause these bitches like mine, love to work,
Get down in the dirt, get money on the turf
Slang that ass for daddy bitch,
It's time to get the old caddy whip
One more time, new paint and interior,
New rims, new top and a new be-yotch,
That's how you say it right,
But $hort Dog say ""Beyotch!"" you better make me rich
And that's how it goes, gotta cover every angle,
So if ya takin' my bitch ain't no need to tangle
Just don't keep braggin' on that used ho,

Talkin' lot, till I spray dumpin ??? niggaz
Whenver talklin shit, I straight rip 'em
And niggaz know I come equip when I whip them
(Short Dawg)
You say how can I make these dirty raps
Number one albums, back to back
If it was 1950, do you think I sell, no
They probably throw me straight to jail
I tell you life just ain't what it used to be
Between you and me, exclusively
Everybody's changed, were losing our minds
The government won't help, 'cause they refuse to find
A solution to the problems of the inner streets
It's a shame what our kids are beginning to be
Pregnant teenagers, young gun slangers
There ain't no love, there ain't nothin' but anger
We don't go to church and can't pray in school
Listen real close to what I'm sayin' fool
I know kids who went to school together
Now they all grown up, tryin' to kill each other
Shootouts on the playground is where it goes down
But back in the day, we rode the merry-go-round
And some little kid might shoot me tonight
And I always used to wonder what the future be like
Curse words on the TV and radio
You wanna see sex, turn it on HBO
Late at night, you see women freak women
Sex sale, that's why I keep pimpin'
I grew up in the 70s', somethin' like Crooklyn
But I was in Cali not Brooklyn
I could tell the whole world was going crazy
But it really didn't happen till the 80s'
With freebasin and smokin' crack
A lotta people learned not to joke with that
Streets flooded, with homeless folks
Whole families, lives gone up in smoke
We're all related to a crackhead
Sometimes I wake up in the mornin and wanna go back to bed
Layin these thinkin' bout things
About the way life change
How women used to like to wear decent clothes
Now they curse like men and dress like hoes
You supposed to be a virgin till you marry
But teenage girls find it normal to carry a baby
Babies havin' babies
Rappers like me always disrespectin ladies
Wonder why it's like that, well so do I
But I just turn my back and then I go get high
'Cause I get paid real good to talk bad about a bitch
And you bought it, so don't be mad I got rich
Ask your grandparents, is life the same
Man thangs change
There used to be a time when old folks were respected
Kids talkin' back was never accepted
Get spanked and your mouth got washed out with soap
But kids nowadays will curse out old folks
Then you tell me I need to be a role model
And get these babies off the 40ounce bottles
But I'm not the one who made alcohol legal
Liquor stores on every corner that's why we go
Buy 40ounces and go get drunk
Don't respect our kids, like no good punks
And then they grow up to be hardcore criminals
Shoot 'em up, slang dope always pimpin' hoes
I know its those that don't believe what I'm sayin' on the mic right
So Baby D won't you tell them what it's like
(Baby D)
Its kinda hard comin' up as a youngster
Gotta deal with the roof that I'm under
Even though my moms got it hard
My daddy passed away, now I'm stuck without a father
But times have changed bro
I never ever seen Santa Claus comin' through the ghetto
But you know what I always see
I always see the white man robbin the black man back G
And I don't even get in trouble for it
And I don't see nothin' forward
Always tryin' to beat the black man to death
Punk police wanna hide behind your badge
Always tryin' arrest somebody
All we gotta do is beat him with the billyclub
Here I come, I comin' with my gun
I'm shootin in the head police now what
(Short Dawg)
I tell you life is too short for it to be like that
We gotta be leaders, can't follow the pack
With all them fiends in the streets smokin' crack
What you give life is what it gives you back
Cause money in the ghetto ain't nothin' new
But when you get the money gotta know what to do
Buy you a business or buy you a house
Just so the police can't wipe you out
I heard it in the streets, they say you the man
So try to help your brothers and lend a helpin hand
Now what we gone do
(Mr. Malik)
We came to stack some bodies, killin' everybody like John Gotti
I said we came to stack some bodies, killin' everybody like John Gotti
Now run up and get gun up the slack black
I'm hittin blackjack in the casino when I mack slap
What you wanna play like Al Pacino with this
Type of style withthe lyricist this funk of hits
And the biscuits I drop
Motherfuckers know I come down and show me ??
I don't really care
From the front or the rear
Word to your mother I'm bout to smother and smear
It's that master all I intelligent
Chain that I swing from the others is irrelevant
For you motherfucker step up to the m-i-c
I'm down with Shorty, Ant Banks and Mally G
Its Malik and I freak it's obsolete
My technique motherfucker know I flow over beats
Like water, slaughter dick in yo daughter
And my nuts up in her jaws when she suckin on my balls
Yiggy y'all niggaz best to ask somebody
'Cause I'm shootin motherfuckers down with the shotty
It's the motherfuckin master blaster
Its, it's the motherfuckin ghetto bastard"

Niggaz runnin' they mouth, niggaz cessed you out
That's how it goes down
What happened to the days when we could hug a block
Flippin rocks and just get money
I remember when you and me used to ball, we had it all, and we took a fall
I came up in Cokeland, better known as Oakland
Your weed could sell, are you smokin'?
Eighteen with a big Mercedes
Sellin dope in the mid-eighties
Homie talkin' bout I'm about to win
Now when you gon' let'em all out the pen
You sold crack to hell and back
Whoever would have thought you could fail at that
Bein broke ain't never been cool
And it ain't no hope when you're failing in school
You might as well flip the sac
Roll out of town and take a trip with that
Or you could just hit the block
Stayin on the corner, come and get the rocks
Bein out on the streets as a young teen
Wasn't always a fun thing
You're thuggin' and you love the streets
Huggin the block, sellin rocks, gettin' major heat
And niggaz hatin', and you ain't stop to think about
Niggaz runnin' they mouh, niggaz snitched you out
That's how it goes down
What happened to the days when we could hug a block
Flippin rocks and just get money
I remember when you and me used to ball
We had it all, and we took a fall
That's how it goes down
Dope fiend still get high
While dope dealers barely get by
You better get your life right
You wanna live in the 'burbs with your white wife
Do your own thing
I know you want change
And I can't play you wrong man
I'm laced with that long game
It's just not a lot of choices man
You ain't plannin to go to jail with the poison clan
So you could be another number in the system, stuck, for years
Got a brother in the pen fucked up
All the stashes you know you kept
And everything that the police left
It's too late when you notice it
It's all gone, motherfuckers done stole yo shit
You wanna kill'em and you still do
But realize that real killas get killed too
You're thuggin' and you love the streets
Huggin the block, sellin rocks, gettin' major heat
And niggaz hatin', and you ain't stop to think about
Niggaz runnin' they mouth, niggaz cessed you out
That's how it goes down
What happened to the days when we could hug a block
Flippin rocks and just get money
I remember when you and me used to ball, we had it all, and we took a fall
He's disappeared into thin air, he's nowhere
Whens the last time he been here, we don't care
'Cause he don't come around no mo'
Nigga live with his momma, down in brough
He's just tryin' to survive
I guess it's all right cause at least he's alive
Cause nowadays a lil kid might shoot you down
Life's wild in the town
Young fools like to clown
He did the same thing, fall for the lies
Hold your head up high and swallowed the pride
Caught in a trap, but don't know what you in
Had a million, now you ain't got two cents
You can't say nothin', now what
I don't hear you talkin' all that loud stuff
If you live and you die by the game and you lose
At least you did spend your life tryin' to change
You're thuggin' and you love the streets
Huggin the block, sellin rocks, gettin' major heat
And niggaz hatin', and you ain't stop to think about
Niggaz runnin' they mouth, niggaz cessed you out
That's how it goes down
What happened to the days when we could hug a block
Flippin rocks and just get money
I remember when you and me used to ball, we had it all, and we took a fall
That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down
(Singing)
I remember when we had it all...(we had it all)
And I remember when we used to ball...(we used to ball)
I remember, don't you remember
When we had it all, we used to ball
That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down"
209,That's Right,2002,What's My Favorite Word? (2002),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"That's right...
Right right right
I know you love me, I'm like a habit
But if you had a million dollars, could I have it?
If I was broke and starvin, would you feed me?
If I drove a big car, would you see me?
While I'm foldin yo' money in half
If you was holdin' on down to yo' last
You know I need it, everything you got
I gotta get it or we'll never see the top
If it was a Happy Meal, or a half-a-mill
It's the same thing baby, that's real
Don't matter if you're holdin' out, no doubt
If you fuckin' Ludacris bitch, +Rollin' Out+
With a Chinese name, Won Gone
Pack yo' bags, and get the fuck on
It's understandable, why I do what I do
Gettin' money every day and I'm still comin' through, right...
I'm a woman that'll hold you down
When the other ones can't be fou-ounnnd, that's right
I'm a woman that'll keep you rich
When the others want you to tri-iiiick - that's right
I need team players, to roll with
Get down with an O.G., knowin' it
Would you mix Hennessy, with Tanqueray?
Let me fuck yo' best friend every day
Would you walk from Compton to Hollywood
From Richmond to Oakland I got it good
From the Soul Train Awards to the Grammys
From New York City to Miami
If I went to jail, would you bail me out?
If I went through hell, would you help me out?
Get a king and have better things
Sell your grandmomma's wedding ring
Unconditional love, would you donate yo' kidneys?
I wanna know how much would you give me
Let my dawg hit it, matter fact let us all get it
Break somethin' off on it, right...
I'm a woman that'll hold you down
When the other ones can't be fou-ounnnd, that's right
I'm a woman that'll keep you rich
When the others want you to tri-iiiick - that's right
I woke up one day in the A-T-L
With a pocket full of money feelin' way too real
Thinkin' bout what happened 'fore I went to sleep
I'd be broke if it wasn't for the pimp in me
Read my mind, I want what you got
Top down girl, bumpin Tupac
You got too much money in your freak pants
That's why I keep my ladies in a deep trance
From January to December
She can't remember, her mind's in a blender
Wake up in the back of a Caddy
Don't even know who's your momma or your daddy
The name is Too $hort
I'm addictive like Newports, but of course
You can fight the feelin' if you want to
But this game might come back to haunt you, right...
I'm a woman that'll hold you down
When the other ones can't be fou-ounnnd, that's right
I'm a woman that'll keep you rich
When the others want you to tri-iiiick - that's right"
210,That's Why,1996,Gettin' It (Album Number Ten) (1996),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"*(Too Short talking)*
I don't stop rappin',
Ever since the very first day,
I grabbed the microphone, made a funky ass tape,
I had sixteen hoes,
Suckin ten toes,
Game from the ""O"",
An any real pimp knows,
The only love hoes get is what they paid fo,
Gimme my scratch,
What the fuck I'm a stay fo?
I gotta make moves bitch,
Stack some G's,
From the whole stroll,
To my fax machine,
I got money comin' in from everywhere,
From New York,
To L.A.,
To the mutha fuckin' Bay,
It's true,
I'm the man G,
I'm underground 106 can't ban me,
All on the air sayin' they don't fuck wit me no mo,
I go back wit rap like K-P-O-O,
From the very first time I grabbed the mic,
Niggaz smokin' burner,
Ready to fight,
I don't promote violence,
I'm from Oakland where the real kick it,
You might get killed nigga,
Or make a mill ticket,
Move down south 'cause the town is wild,
Now the radio jocks wanna clown my style,
I raised too many rappers you support,
Ask 'em who they grew up on... TOO $HORT,
Fuck all that black ball shit it won't last,
KMEL y'all can kiss my ass.
That's why the town got rid 'o $hort (x2)
It all started back when C & H,
Went to T & B tryin' to playa hate,
I flipped a brand new Lexus,
93,
Joda Balls called me up said ya lyin' to me,
He said I heard you an Ran got the cash an split it,
If I don't get my cut,
You mutha fuckaz gonna get it,
It was thirteen G's all mine,
Didn't give Teddy Gram one dime,
Now listen real close 'cause it might be,
Hard to follow,
Chris told Ted it was fifty thousand dollaz,
Shit sound petty,
An it is,
But that's how it goes when you in show biz,
Niggaz fallin' out,
Should be makin' millions,
Instead of studios,
We seein lawyers in buildings,
Then we stop speakin',
Shit got funky,
I don't give a fuck,
Mutha fucka get my money,
I ain't never been a hoe you can't pimp me,
I do all the work while you pimp me,
I tried to buy him out,
But right about then,
They let the lions out,
Niggaz start eatin that shit up,
You shoulda never listened,
I'm always on this money makin' mission,
Sold a car an a truck in Oakland fo that Lex,
Jock loaned me five an I was rollin' that bitch.
Don't believe everythang you hear nigga.
I went to the freak-nik,
Shit turned me out,
Came back fo jack the rapper,
Bought me a house,
That was August '93 time to dip,
I hade warrants in the town an I was hot as shit,
Everytime I got stopped,
Nigga went to jail,
Treat me bad 'cause I was hangin' wit criminals,
I wanted to buy me a house in the Oakland hills,
Nice lil sumpthin fo a half a mill,
That's was right around the time Chris hooked Dru Down,
The Luniz came through an them tricks got clowned,
Rappin' Ron tore 'em up on the freestyle tip,
An niggaz ain't ran nobody outta shit,
Then they put it on the town,
Shit got real,
When you was in the fourth grade I had a record deal,
You got one hit record now you ballin,
You make one fake album you'll be fallin',
An that shit don't apply to me,
Present or past,
You can meet me at the mall an get my autograph,
Or you can flash back,
If you can do all that,
Me Fred Benz,
An Freddy Craps,
Smokin' burner upstairs in hot lips house,
It's been fifteen years an I ain't played out,
They playin' Too $hort steppin on a Chevy pedal,
Back in the days KMEL played heavy metal.
Niggaz shootin at the studio late at night,
Seen a Charokee,
Started shootin at Spice,
At the E-40 picnic out in the park,
Niggaz gather round fo some shit to start,
They had bullets wit my name,
But we never got to me,
See me sucka mutha fucka,
Shootin at the street,
It was me,
Boo, Howard, an Jock,
A full clip,
One in the chamber an it blockin T.B.,
Still tryin' to be my pimp,
I could lose my life,
Or give my money to him,
I'd rather die before you use me,
I tried to buy him out,
The nigga sued me.

To suck my dick until I sweat
I need a bitch, thick as hell
She's gotta suck dick so I can tell
All my homies, what she did
She sucked and sucked and she's a bitch
The homeboys laugh, every time
And then I put her in my rhyme
Talk about a bitch who sucked dick
Man oh man that bitch can lick

And then I put her in a rhyme
'Cause when a bitch sucks me down
I kick on back and think about now

Bust big nuts like a big ol player
And sometimes baby we could fuck
But every time you know she sucks
The bitch sucked dick, so much dick
I loved to get my dick sucked by that bitch
Me and homeboy roll to the hyatt
Shit went crazy when they had a riot
I got in the cutlass, went a few blocks
Saw a bitch and had to stop
Asked her if she needed a ride
The bitch just kept on walking by
So I said baby, could we just talk
I make you see, no need to walk
She never should have stopped, now that time
'Cause now baby, you're in my rhyme
I remember you leaving, said I'll see you soon
I remember us going in my room
But I've never seen you, you freaky bitch
I now I tell the world just how you live
Too bad baby, we couldn't fuck
Everytime I see ya I'm a say you suck
The bitch sucked dick
Man that bitch is going to give a vicious blow job
When I drop my drawls, I'll be ready
Blow more head than blow job betty
Suck my dick, and suck it cool
And suck my homie when he come through
Just suck dick, till you see no other
I think my homie, is bringing his brother
All my homies are coming up
Kick back and cap and say she sucks
The bitch sucked dick
That bitch sucked dick (echo)
I love a bitch like that, suck a whole lotta dick
Knows, get a nigger all juiced up when they bust into the bitches mouth

You might get fucked if you don't suck dick
But I'm so freash, I'm so down
I tell that bitch the other way around
Suck my dick and you'll get some
Ill fuck you baby till your cock is numb
Ill bust my nut in her mouth
Smooth get dressed and roll out

Kicking it tough just like a pimp

'Cause she just can't wait to fuck
So for that one reason you know she sucks
The bitch sucked dick, so much dick
I just love that bitch for that good blowjob
I'm too s-h-o-r-t
Rap so strong to the disco beat
Talk about bitches who ever licked

And you looked up and see me frown
Cause your one bitch Ill never fuck

Get some drums from a break and then break yo ass
You want beats from the crew? we'll take yo cash
Five g's for a muthafuckin song
And if you can't pay it, keep movin on
I'm into somethin' that your fake ass never can handle
With your sp-12 and your raggedy samples
Better stick with the james brown and pay him
Cause the jd-800 ain't even playin'
Unless pee wee hit them keys
Ant banks on the beats, now we makin' g's
Shorty b got the bass and we sellin it
Shit kinda fat like a muthafuckin elephant
Sample that shit if you want
You better try to sample this dangerous funk
Cause ain't nobody trippin' on your fake-ass tape
Shoulda got some beats from my nigga ant banks
But banks ain't thinkin' 'bout no weak shit
Now you're goin' out like MC bitch
And ain't nothin' worth killin' like a sucker
Why you wanna make fake beats, muthafucka
Shoulda came real like the oakland city
Beat your ass to death with a s-950
It's not a james brown loop, it's not parliament
But you can smell it cause it sho' got a funky scent
It's called the dangerous crew, make you feel stupid
Play a thousand records and you still can't loop it
'Cause it's not to be found, but if you do
Nothin' you could try make you sound like the crew
{Pee wee:}
Geah man
Just another gangsta kickin tha playa pimp shit for nine-trey
When you're with the dangerous crew
Bitches wann hang with you
Think about the thang in you
She can suck a thang or two
Niggas in other gangs wanna hang with you
Learn your slang, made a few fools wanna slang, would you
Tell them bitches they sang or would you
Lie to get that thang 'cause they gameless
Them aimless, niggas get extinguished
But they're just muthafuckas
Got bitches duckin suckers
When we come to town, mayn
We rollin' fat with dank, ain't fuckin' with that brown thang
To shorty b and $hort, we goin' international
Fuck the local fashion show
Niggas can't be broke
Mhisani for the money fuck a bitch until she dizzy
And me and the bigged-banks is gettin' perkin off aliz? big bob's down with the crew ready to do

You thought that you can hang with this

And tell 'em funky-cock hoes to have a lick
Fuckin' with the gin and juice, dick hard as a rock
Hoes block to block, so what's up with the cock?
I gotta get it goin' on till I reach my peak
With a late night freak everyday of the week
Ant banks, the hoes keep yellin' my name
But I ain't trippin' cause a nigga got all the game
>From the streets of oakland, the city of dope, and
I'm hopin that the hoes keep the pussy hole open
To a nigga like me cause the pussy is free
Never pay to play 'cause it's plain to see
That the big-dick gangsta's in the house
And the dangerous crew's gonna turn it out
So everybody out there that's talkin' shit
I'ma wash my name out your mouth with my dick
'Cause it's a dangerous thang, and I thought you knew
Boy, you can't fuck with the crew
{Mhisani:}
Clinch your booty cheek, shut your eyes, and grit your teeth
Goldy's bout to explode, I put your shit to cease
I'm like the wick on a stick of dynamite
Light me up when I find a mic
And watch me flow real tight while you're flowin - kinda tight
Goldy bitches comin' tighter than some virgin pussy
If I ever get loose and start stinkin, please douche me
The dangerous crew ain't no strangers to
What these fingers do, hang his crew
A cold dead nigga changes blue
The skull and crossbones
Bitches get tossed on, niggas get flossed on
Take your mic and bury it like it's a lost bone
If you was a pussy you'd get fucked
If you was a dick you'd get circumsized
You better back the fuck up or I hurt them eyes
Fuck with goldy you be hoein
With your shoulder above your stomach in a bow tie
Unbuttoned with your nipples showin
D to the a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s is the true test
In oakland makin' the funk, so won't you stick to what you do best
Keep a dick in your ass and keep your nine to five
And don't be runnin' and rappin' about you signed to jive
And I don't give a fuck if it angers you
Fuck you woodhogs, I'm down the $hort dog and the dangerous crew

(Talking 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Funk funky ghetto)
Even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out
Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouths
Old school buddies not doing it right
Every day it's the same
And it's the same every night
I wouldn't shoot you bro but I'd shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wonder just how I'll die
Only thing I know is how to survive
There's only one rule in the real world
And that's to take care of you, only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope but then crime don't pay
Black man tried to break into my house again
Thought he got off early doing time in the pen
Even though my brothers do me just like that
I get a lot of love so I'm giving it back to the...
So just peep the game and don't call it crap
Cause to me, life is one hard rap
Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed
600 million on a footbal team
And her baby dies just like a dope fiend
The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house and no food to eat
Don't look at me and don't ask me why
Mama's next door getting high
Even though she's got five mouths to feed
She's rather spend her money on a h-i-t
I always tell the truth about things like this
I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
Instead of adding to the task force send some help
Waiting on him I'd better help myself
Housing authority and the o.p.d.
All these guns just to handle me in the...
Even though they put us down and call us animals
We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
Drive fancy cars, make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like too $hort
Sell you stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and that's all they know
Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies?
In the ghetto, you keep one eye open
All day long, just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
Like me, but you don't see
Ten years from now, where will you be?
So much game in a too $hort rap
Blacks can't be white and whites can't be black
Why you wanna act like someone else?
All you gotta do is just be yourself
We're all the same color underneath
Short dog's in the house you'd better listen to me
Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black stand tall at heart
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put 'em in check
'Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen it's not my fault
I'll be getting paid while you'll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth
While me and my peoples try to get out"
215,The Invasion Of Flat Booty Bitches,1983,"Greatest Hits, Volume 1: The Player Years 1983-1988 (1993)",Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Baby, check this out
Yeah you
I wanna ask you a question
Where is yo ass?
Babby, what happened?
A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with alotta butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's OK if she's got cash
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
I'll tell you 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin' but bitches with no ass
I woke up early feelin' shabby
Got juiced up with a big fat Cabby
'Cause every morning you know I have
A big fat Cabby and a nice hot bath
Just soakin, smokin', Sir Too Short
Thinkin' about the day before
Thirty minutes after I woke out
I pulled a freak and took her to the house
She was Eleve Young, with alotta butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That good tight pussy, I wouldn't pass
A light-skinned freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin' away
I wanna do the same thing again today
I want bitches, bitches, and more bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The day my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself I must need glasses
Where's them bitches with the big brown asses
Me and my group just wanna be tough
Freak two bitches then switch 'em up
It was 3:35, the strip was lit
Every two blocks I seen a bitch
But that ain't nothin' but a cat
None of them bitch didn't have no ass
Wait on the bus, some was walkin'
Me and my homie just started talkin'
I said, oh, she looks good
He said that ass is flat as wood
I said what about Vicky in the black
He said, Short, she's all that
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The Invasion was on...
Every single day of the week
For every nigga livin' there's a freak
If you've got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
'Cause bitches all over wanna get worked
I just need one with alotta turf
Me and my homie, rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie, I hate to say
All the bitches with booties stayed home today
And he said Short, what now?
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the B-Town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
We hit the B-Town like Oakland flares
I knew it, bitches was everywhere
The first one had tits so fat
But that don't work, her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
I capped on her like a motherfuckin fool
I said be-atch, I know I'm cappin
Where's your ass, baby what happened
She turned around and capped on me
She said, fuck you nigga, where's your teeth
I damn near fell jumpin' out the car
But I slapped that bitch, and slapped her hard
My homie said Short we gots to cut
But I was kickin that bitch and her big flat butt
I kicked her ass, got in the ride
Looked at the bitch and said bye bye
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The invasion was on...
We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk
I said baby, baby, baby come here
Yeah you baby with your long long hair
Baby came over from across the street
She was standin on the corner just talkin' to me
I was spittin' the game but I talked to fast
'Cause I didn't even notice that big flat ass
Shit, and I was ready to go
We was rollin' back to the O
I told that bitch I changed my mind
She looked at me and she said why?
I said I'm Sir Too Short, the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and yo flat booty
Flat ain't the date superstar
I could see if you was white, but your black as tar
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
In the Berkeley temp, what did we find?
Freak after freak with no behind
One long day, I never got in
I'm glad that shit never happened again
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Damn, I must be dreamin'
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Wake me up 'fore I start screamin
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
What's this world comin' to?
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
Where's your ass, what happened to you?
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The invasion is on..."

"")
What you rhyme mayne? You always spend G's
How much cash you got that you can lend me?
Think I'll pay you back, think you flossin hard
When you ridin' down the strip in yo' boss's car?
With your silver chain on and your fake diamonds
Cain't do it right but you stay tryin'
You got big dreams, to hit a lick quick
And buy a brand new house, but you ain't get shit
Wouldn't even know what to do if you had bread
How to be a baller - can you pass the test?
There's more than one way to hit the top
Trunk full of dope nigga don't get stopped
Take it to the house and bag it up
Make that money and stack it up
Or spend it all in one place, what you want from me?
I can't tell you how to run yo' company
And don't start bitchin bout Too $hort
What the fuck I wanna listen to you fo'?
Look at you, you ain't all that successful
Them plates ain't made out of Cristal
You just regular, plain ol' frontin
You come from nowhere and you don't claim nuttin
Stop bein phony, actin' hella hard
Girl at the mall, maxin your credit card
Answer your cell phone, now you smilin'
Talk to your girl, man it's been a while
Since she left to go shoppin', girl where you at?
She out havin' lunch with a player mack
I'm in the background, don't trip partner
Just munchin on the lunch that your bitch bought me
She don't love you, she just used to you
Got your mom and them wonderin what she do to you
I don't pay hoes, I turn 'em
I teach hoes, you learn 'em
How we get them hoes, don't concern 'em
The old fashioned way, we earn 'em
I been in the game, I did it
I'm true to the game, I'm so committed
I got a lot of hoe money, where you get it
The old fashioned way, I just spit it
I'm pimpish, I never let hoes pimp me
I let one bitch get me, and instantly
She dipped to Mexico, I'ma get you hoe
I'ma find you and check you like a physical
I'm not a doctor, but I cut a bitch open
With this game have her broken never quit hoein
A bad habit, I picked up along the way
Break a bitch, and make a new song every day
I do my own thing, I'm original
I was ""Born to Mack"" when I came in the do'
Just so you know, I got the game from the East
Lake Merritt (?) to Sobranny (?) in them East Oakland streets
Took my game on the road, became a millionaire
Tell the world get ready for a real player
And so it happened, I grabbed the mic and start rappin'
Make that money keep stackin
I made a new album, fourteen times
Hoes screamin out Too $hort keep rhymin
I got rich screamin BITCH
My favorite word; I hear it on - E'RYBODY shit
And when they say it like me, I couldn't want mo'
Send a special thanks out to yo' Uncle $hort
Do yo' thang nephew, y'know I'm down witcha
Stay strapped, watch yo' back, don't let the town getcha
And when you get mad, try to use your brain
Get some street etiquette, don't abuse the game
You know us real ones, you know we never bite
When these hoes start shit you know we never fight
'Cause I'd be layin on the ground feelin' real silly
All I did was fuck his bitch, that nigga still killed me
And even though I know a sucker spent all his cash
Just so he could fuck and try to get some ass
I don't pay hoes, I turn 'em
I teach hoes, you learn 'em
How we get them hoes, don't concern 'em
The old fashioned way, we earn 'em
I been in the game, I did it
I'm true to the game, I'm so committed
I got a lot of hoe money, where you get it
The old fashioned way, I just spit it"
217,These Are the Tales,2001,Chase the Cat (2001),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"These are the tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
(Tune in to the history channel)
These are the tales (learn a lesson biatch)
These are the tales that I tell so well (Short Dog)
I'm thinkin' way back, it's been a long long time
In 1980 I wrote my first rhyme
I like to spit a lot of game
But back then, I was just sayin' my name
I had a record player, on my stereo
Got down on my knees with my radio
From Oakland California with some new shit
I'm Sir Too $hort I'm bout to do this
In 1981, that's where it all begun
We do it for the money we don't rap for fun
Five dolla's fo' a tape, Too $hort and Freddy B
Money in my pocket's all I ever need
It was me, Fred B, and Freddy Brack
Dipped the sermon sticks then we smoked them phat
While we rapped about the bitches and all the ho's
Can't be in the hole tryin' to ball without vogues
In '82 you was in the game
With a Falcon, Cougar or a Mustang
Me and Freddy B used to hit the turfs
With a bag of tapes puttin' in work, Biatch
In '83 you hit a house party
A dolla' get you in and a dolla' fo' a drink
I'm on the turntable smokin' get-right
And at mid-night I'll be rappin' on the mic
I did the same thang, for the next two years
That's why they say my name, when I come through here
When I was 16, I want'd to be a mack
I went to Fremont High with Lil' D and Black
Young ballers in the town livin' real phat
Never had the sack but I smoked a little crack
Crushed up in the weed, we call 'em bass rock Caddies
Goin' on them grimmies make them ho's call me daddy
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well
It's been 15 years since that shit happened
But Too $hort don't stop rappin'
In '85, I was on the right page
Ten thousand niggaz, $hort live on stage
Underground tapes was all they ever heard
But the whole crowd sang along with me word for word
And that changed everything
Went to Seventy Five Girls and hooked up with Dean
Real player-ism and that's no joke
Snort a lot of coke with ho's that like to smoke
I was makin' records but wasn't makin' money
You can take it seriously or you can think its funny
By '87, I was on my own, started Dangerous Music
And I made the song ""These are the tales, the freaky tales""
No radio or video or CD sales
Six platinums in a row Ice Cube and Cool J
Who else did that shit? $hort Dog from the Bay
These ho's try to play it safe
But I been mackin' hard since eighty-eight
And from eighty-nine to ninety-six
I was rappin' on the mic talkin' shit about a bitch
I'll retire 10 times and I'll still be here
My old records sell about a half a mil' a year
I say ""bitch get naked"" so pimpishly
Spit rhymes through decades and centuries
And bitches just love my dirty mouth
When I see you again I'ma cuss you out, BIATCH!
That's my gift, now all you rappers get to say that shit
I won't sue you, but that's the trademark
I was a grown ass man when you was playin' in the park lil' nigga
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well
Now I'm in Atlanta I still love the O
I gave you my bitch but you can't have my flow
I guest appeared on 47 albums
Fuck McDonalds and fuck Calvin
I get money with Erick Sermon when I'm in New York
I get respect, they call me Too $hort
I live swell in A.T.L. 'cause I'm a player
We fuckin' hella ho's at X House in Decatur where it's greater
You know how we ride
I got love for all niggaz from the EastSide
It was me, Ant Banks and Shorty B
All we need to do is find my nigga PeeWee
We used to be on Murdel Street makin' funky songs
If you see him tell him Short said its back on
Let's get this money, midwest down South
East coast West coast ride out, BIATCH
(Too $hort talking over Hook)
That's my gift to rap, you can have that word
Say bitch all you want, all you regular fake ass niggas
You finally get to have Too $hort's bitch, trick
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well"

Motherfucker make 'em feel good, ya know my name

We eatin sirloin steak, y'all fools eat Cheerios
(Tray Deee)
Fuck a business suit, I'm out to where we juice
Push the Bentley coupe and spend endless loot
Runnin' game from the brain or the stainless steel
Pushin Holt's high-heels when we bang the field
With the heat out, jack the whole hood with G-clout
Invisible perimeters for niggaz to keep out
You ain't got to ask what the fuck what we bout
Whatever, get the cheddar than an nigga can ease out
(Goldie Loc)
I used to be able to jump from the free-throw line and bang
Now I bust and crush tracks, nothin' really changed
Except, twelve-inch scars on my body
What I mean by that, I was hit by some hotties (nigga)
Call somebody, I'm layin in this motherfucker bloody
It wasn't because of my shoes, clothes, or money
I was at the wrong place at the wrong time
Paramedics don't know, I was a victim of the crime
(Talking)
Just keep gettin' that money mayne
Fuck them niggaz, yeah... this how we eat
(Chorus: Kokane)
We got, top-notch hoes, y'all fools got crack-hoes
We eatin sirloin steak, y'all fools eat Cheerios

($Hort) Do yo' thang and get rich
(TrayD) Get wise, enterprise with the game ya got
(TrayD) You could slang some rocks, but better change ya spot
($Hort) Ask anybody; I stay paid
($Hort) Most niggaz want pussy, tryna get laid
(TrayD) Stayin soft with a hoe getchu crossed by a hoe
(TrayD) I break a bitch down then I'm off with the dough
($Hort) I'm so hungry, I can't wait to eat
($Hort) I ride brand new shit down the street
(TrayD) Life is a game of chess, who plays the best
(TrayD) is the last one that's laid to rest
($Hort) I know you wanna eat good - it ain't hard
($Hort) to be a real ghetto superstar
(TrayD) Focus is the key - if ya want it, it could be
(TrayD) If ya know where ya goin' from the moment you could see
(TrayD) that's game
(Chorus: Kokane)
We got, top-notch hoes, y'all fools got crack-hoes
We eatin sirloin steak, y'all fools eat Cheerios

Catch me headed out west, Impala drive
And when they see balkin and be talkin' bout (?)

It's on and poppin' now, but we wattn't always this big
Wanted a Benz and a Lotus (what?)
Whatever feels, sprayin Raid on the roaches
I mean the whole damn scene was kinda hopless (whattchu mean?)
Came home to it, then we flipped the notice
Now we big crib livin', Rockland and non-stop
With hot women, cop drops with rims that don't stop spinnin (whoo!)
And it's just the beginnin (what?)
'Cause as long as the game strong we gon' keep winnin'
Big Tigger, Too $hort, drops it so mean
That lets us go get us a team of flatscreens
Three cars, three cribs and three bikes
When I drop this hot shit, I'm gonna cop three plus three mics
(Talking)
Y'all niggaz better stop playin' and get yo' game tight
Too $hort, Eastsidaz, Big Tig... oh boy

UHH~! Where I stay they gotta temper they locks
Get they hair done down at Nappy or Not (BAY AREA!)
No funk abusin the cops
Droppin' off yola in the Wal*Mart parkin lot (parkin lot)
Hustle in our arteries, re-up and re-cop (cop)
Cemeteries, mortuaries, tryin' to get guap' (UHHH)
Drugs, fetti and sex
Chicken one day, fed goods the next (UHHH~!)
I got a cold conversation
Could talk a cop out a ticket in front of the police station
My niggaz KNOW I'm a patient
When you're funkin or beefin all it takes is a little patience
(UHHH) Gotta be slick and sly
I ain't gon' kill nuttin, and I ain't gon' let nuttin die
Looted up, suited up, rap for fun
Wanna hear this black right here? Nigga say, this my one
Droop-E made the black, Sic'Wid'It hog
Who that rappin' on the track? 40-Wat' and $hort Dawg
(At the bank they call us Earl and Todd)
(We up all night, hustlin hard)
UHHH {can't stop won't stop} this my one
{We gotta get it how we get it} this my one
{Like the beat hear knocks} this my one
{Got 'em all in the clubs yellin} this my one
(Too $hort)
Things can't stay the same
Somebody gotta break the chain
Put some big money back in the game
We havin' big money and we at it a-gain
But can you handle it mayne
Or would rather be grimy doin' scandalous thangs?
You wanna ball, you can't tell him he ain't
'Cause if the music don't pay he gon' sell 'em the 'caine
All the crack babies are growin' up now
They got ADD, throw it up and act wild
Extra hyper, she asked me if I like her
Slow down girl, you move faster than a Viper
You're too freaky, you're way too sleazy
You could make some money but you give it up easy
Can't even get a coke dealer
You a broke bitch fuckin' with a broke nigga!
(E-40)
UHHH... I play my position
So much throb in the trunk got the CD player skippin
(CD player skippin) I'm smokin' and sippin
Hood life, speed bumps in the residential district
UHHHHH~! Pimpin' this the anthem
Got the Chrysler lips, lookin' like a phantom
Like a PHANTOM! I burn rubber on a hater
If it ain't about yaper I'm hit the 'ccelerator
(Too $hort)
Me and E-40, we rap for money
On funky-ass tracks with slappin drumbeats
Pay me up front 'cause I'm not a dummy
Promoters like bitches when I'm hot they want me
... And that's all the time
I stay on tour, knockin' all the dimes
I can't name 'em, the list is long
But when they hear that bass shit they say ""This my one!"""
220,Top Down,1995,Cocktails (1995),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"(Short)
How freaky can you get to a long fat dick
Hella freaky like I said to a song that hit
I'm the dirty rapper Too $hort, the triple X
Run up in the pussy, rub the nipple next
Bitch, which is worse?
My bark or my bite
You heard about me
And now I'm fucking you from dark to the light
You must of thought I got nicer
Talking about Heiser
I'm an old dogg and old dogg's get wiser
Caught up in the game, got ya thinking while your doing this
You never did this, sucking on a big dick
What bitch? You better check the size, and recognize
When I'm between your thighs
Shit, I get hard from the sound of a kidrum
Riding down the strip with your diamonds and ??
Shiny bald head catching sun rays
Smashing down the strip going backwards down runways
Four eighteens with the zues and the zapto
Sounding like I'm riding out a concert at a rap show
Hit a back street and put the top up
Stopped at the light see some hoes watch 'em jock us
I'm so roll with my electric top
Hit a button, ain't gotta get out, fuck with nothin'
Let the top just fold up and lay down
Slamming hard passing by the schools and the playgrounds
Everybody knows when Short's in town
'Cause I keep the beats thumping hella-hard with my top down
(Whisper) Drop the top
(Whisper) Just drop the top
(Short) We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
(Short) Whatever you call it just drop the top
(Short) We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
(Short) Whatever you call it just drop the top
Nine albums out, ain't changed my talk
A thousands hoes walked on I'm still a dogg
Ain't changed nothing but the hoe that I'm fucking
Still riding through the hood all the homies say ""Was ??""
Give me my props 'cause I always rock
And I still gets cock when the fine hoes jock
Still smoking Indo getting burned out
Still got the orange juice bottle full of gin 'bout to turn out
A show
A hoe smashed back to the O
Put them bitches on my beeper then pull some mo'
'Cause I bump more hoes than acme
I guess you bitch can't learn that you just can't mack me
I'm off of Gin and Juice
Don't even introduce
If you ain't fucking back up 'cause I'm free to choose
I want some pussy that could make write a freaky tale
Drawls back, bootie cracks, bitch in a hotel
Just to say you got some Too $hort dick
You wanna show some evidence, don't swallow don't spit
'Cause I bust more nuts than a squirel
And my dick been in pussies all around the world
If you had a picture of it and you asked the bitch
What's this?
I bet you say, ""Too $hort dick""
I still taunt the fine hoes and get shot down
I say ""BITCH"", slam the beat
Smash off with my top down
Just riding with my top down
(Short) We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
(Short) Whatever you call it just drop the top
(Short) We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
(Short) Whatever you call it just drop the top
We rode the AC transit bus
Selling joints for a dollar, smoking angel dust
On the way to a house party
A maybe delux
Slanging Too $hort tapes
Making some bucks
Looking out the window at the Mustang and Falcon crew
Asking myself ""how can you?""
Roll like the Giants down the foothill strip
With beats thumping top down bumping a bitch
Shit I had to have drop
Didn't care, if I had a Volkswagon
Pick up the beat, had a hoes flaging
Siding with the top down, lit like a lamp
Blowing out the amp, trying to bump a tramp
Most niggers couldn't afford to have a drop top
So they got they shit cut at the chop shop
Couldn't tell niggers nothin' way back then
A lot of niggers died or they went to the pen
Couldn't even see the homie Short Bubble
Bank get fat and my whole account double
When I walk in a club bitches say ""Ooh God,
Is that you Todd?""
Me and my homies just who-ride
And take advantage of a life we never had
Fuck eating cheese sandwiches, broke, living bad
I'm a do it for my homies that's there to lock down
Ride with my beats slamming top down
(Whisper) Drop the top
(Whisper) Just drop the top
(Short) I got my top down
(Whisper) drop the top
(Whisper) Just drop the top
(Short) I'm just rolling with my top down

What's on yo' mind ho? That nigga Too $hort
Got you playin' witcho' pussy fo' twenty-fo'
In the mo'nin, why I won't call you back
Got another little freak all on my lap
She's been tellin' me things that I wanna hear
So I hit you on another day, another year maybe
I still wanna see you baby
I know I told a few lies, you wanna be my lady
I let you ride with a player in my new truck
Take you straight to my house, you can do me up
And back down again, get around your friends
Let 'em know, e'ry nigga from the town's a pimp
My daddy was a player, my grandpa too
Now what the fuck else am I supposed to do?
Put my finger on the pussy, rub the nipple next
Short Dawg's in the house with the triple X
I'm a hooker's dream, a hoe's delight
They prove it, with bankrolls every night
You like to kiss her, she like to drink sperm
Get you high, smokin' that pink sherm
I don't have sex with her, she just give me head
Like the ex-President, I don't need a bed
Let it drip down your cheek, get all on your dress
Rinse the evidence or rub it all on your tits
I don't care - 'cause I'm cold as ice
I don't feel nothin' for you, think you know I'm nice
That's what you heard about Todd when I'm gettin' hoes
Leave a trail of broken hearts when I let 'em go
It's not my fault, 'cause they be all in the club
Believin what I say, bitches fallin' in love
When all I really wanted was a little sex
Turn your ass out with my triple X

Is what I did yesterday it ain't gon' change today
And if I cain't knock you I bet I get her
'Cause I'm a hard workin pimp, I'm not a quitter
These hatin' lames, don't even realize
Short Dawg's dirty rhymes make them fantasize
I don't dream about pussy 'cause I get too much
Can't believe that nasty slut didn't let you fuck
But maybe you ain't ready for the skills she got
Non-stop, hit the cot, the bitch still be hot
She's workin tonight, she'll stick to the script
My life is so tight, when hoes flip you tricks
Put a sponge on her pussy and she'll still be wet
Another bitch turned out by my triple X
It's nothin' new - I've ran up in a few
Hit the party had the hardest G's cuffin them too
'Cause I'm a mack, the whole world knows that
I'm in the house, you better hold your hoes back
Fuck $hort - that's what the bitches thinkin'
Put my hand up her dress and her clit was stinkin
I gotta pass! Pussy smell like ass
So I jumped in my Benz and gave it hella gas
I can't believe you nasty girls tryin' to get some
Sit on my shit and give my dick the runs
Like the East coast homies they don't slip son
Too many women in the world, you bound to get one
That slick bitch, dressed her up and played the road
But all my niggaz out in Texas say the bitch is throwed
She snort coke, rollin' on them triple stacks
Rated X in the back while we dip the 'llac, beotch!"

The luscious bitch, she is true
But it's not nice to fool Mother Nature
The proud mother of God, like all hoes
Is jealous of her own shadow
Who is this young big tawny bitch who wish to be queen for a day?
Who would sacrifice the great grandsons and daughters of her jealous mother?
By suckin their brain until their ability to think was amuptated?
By pimpin' their instincts until they were fat, horny and strung out?
And her right to be kept queen of the universe
Who is this bitch?
(Too $hort)
You get, somethin' for nothin' when you got to get the gas
Spit the game in her ear tell her, get on the ave
It's mind manipulation, in every situation
There's a pimp and a ho, somebody roll this Dayton
Downhill, takin' the easy way
While the other brother say it should be this way
Which one are you? 'Cause I was ""Born to Mack""
Since the day of my birth, I was sworn to that
It's the P-I, M-P, that's in me
You envy, how instantly I make ten G's
And never lift a finger, makes you wanna bring a
Player to the show and get your clown Jerry Springer
Blame the consumer's how I look at life
It's just another day in a hooker's life
With no tricks there's no pimpin'
It's like drugs with no fiends, sex with no women

I'm in the house once again from the east to the north
You know the west is the best coast
We got the best beats, we bump the best hoes
Livin' life way too fast
Start snitchin' and you might not last
It used to be about old pimps and macks
But now we got the young bucks tryin' to jack
It's a stick up, put your hands up before you get bucked
Got you for your watch, your link and your green stuff
Everybody wants to be the man
And when you are, you go straight to the pen
Get rich quick schemes off dope fiends
I know you know what I mean
Makin' big money, livin' stoned to the bone
Oakland, California is where we roam
Hittin' this corner, that corner, everywhere
Bumpin' fly young tenders with the real big hair
Sassy nasty, young ass freaks
Wanna ride in my car and feel the beat
We hit the motel, the head was swell
Baby had back like a big ol' whale
She told all her friends I did her, too
She got dogged like scooby doo
'Cause in the land of macks we don't play that
You wanna run your mouth, you get pimp slapped
And you ask me just how I feel
$Hort dog's livin' Way Too Real.
I'm livin' Way Too Real, bitch
$Hort dog in the house
Can't help but live real. You know what I mean?
Tell you some shit, though.
Been in the game for about 10 years or more
Talkin' about shit you never did before
You know my mackin' is crackin' all of the time
24 7 spitting playboy rhymes
I got a serious grind and it sure ain't fake
You slang D, well I'm a slang a gang of tapes
Something funky fresh for you to ride to, fool
Bendin' corners in the old school
I seen my homey father Dom and he said what's up?
Ridin' in a supersport drunk as fuck
And when you see us, the clique is called The Dangerous Crew
We wouldn't change it for you 'cause the game is true
Some say that the dog can't rap
But my bank account will prove that
I make G's, so you can see these nuts, hoe
Or get played like dominoes
I used to fuck a bitch from san jose
Baby liked to freak all kind of ways
She said I was the best, couldn't settle for less
Had my name $hort dog tattooed on her chest
After 3 months I called it quits
She tried to pop that pregnant shit
But like a mack, I surprised her
Dropped her ass off at kaiser
Never would I let her put a baby on me
I ain't the one, I'm step daddy
I had to let her know just how I feel
I'm livin' Way Too Real.
Don't ever fuck with Too $hort [scratched 4x]
>From city to city, valley to valley
Never seen another state on hit like cali-
Fornia, where the hustlers play
What you wouldn't expect happens everyday
It's the wild wild west I'm speakin' about
Where Clint Eastwood would get socked in the mouth
'Cause ain't nobody trippin' on ranks or stripes
If you live the life, you gotta pay the price
So many youngsta's die over punk shit
Small talk, a lotta dumb shit
And only God knows when you punch the clock
Thought he was bulletproof and got shot
It's either heaven or hell, him or me
Locked in a cell or out on the street
Every day on the ave another brother is killed
For livin' Way Too Real.
Well I'm chillin' & I'm willin' like a villain I be killin'
Coke is it but tonight I got the feelin'
'Cause it's about time for a real mack to step up
Pimpin' ain't a thing so I swing on these heifers
Never ever feelin' no remorse, of couse
If you try to play me out, I'm a punch you in your mouth
And rin tin I'll watch his chin just splatter
Caught him with an uppercut, there goes his bladder
My rhymes are fatter 'cause I said so
I'm gonna recollect a neck, mic wreck check a hoe
I'm makin' more dough than the average joe schmoe
If she's frontin' on the pussy then the hoe got to go
Out the back door, don't want to see you no more
You ain't deep throat. So what you come here for?
'Cause in the 9 tre ain't no lagging or draggin'
Bring your ass over, get prepared for the stabbin'
Ain't no doubt that's how I feel

Like welfare day, can't stop the first of the month
Can't stop Short Dawg neither
Got a good hoe niggaz sure better keep her
'Cause I'm on the prowl, all the time
Tryin' knock every bitch so they all be mine
And I ain't never, ever gone change my ways
Drop a few lines, leave a bitch in a daze
Have her homegirls wonderin what she do
Fucked around and gave me that pussy too
I be doin' this shit on a regular basis
Got bitches everywhere in all kind of places
I can pull out my little black phone book
Flip every last page take a long look
Than pull out a bitch, like a rabbit out a hat
Nigga if I want, I can have it like that
Fuck two or three bitches at the same time
Grab the microphone sing my rhyme
About them same three bitches that fucked me good
Us niggas gotta do what the fuck we should when we want to
I might pass it
So get butt naked, shake that ass bitch
I'm bout as real as the stones in my diamond rings
You can hate my guts, but I'm gone do these things, bitch

Ah why have a nine, when I can have a ten
Lickin' up the nuts, while I'm gone holler at her friend
Bitch, ain't no time for me to teach her
Rather have an everyday hoe, that umm knows how to treat a nigga
Thinkin' if she ain't lickin' me up
I'm givin' her to Short, 'cause he don't give a fuck
Do yourself a favor and quit callin my house
If you really don't want this nigga to put this dick in your mouth
Umm, have you seen my bitch?
I ain't seen her, but if I do she gets dick
That's what I'm givin' her just like that
To the front and back, nothing but the bozack
The second she get lonely, feelin' she can get her money
And she run to fuck her own ignorant homey
You a lost cause, yellin' pause when they drop the draws
Its's entrapment, have yo nigga breakin nigga laws
But it ain't a matter of mentality, it's reality
Open your eyes, realize bitches ain't nothin' but a casuality
But a factor to a nigga wanting fuckin' time
She's just an everday, don't wanna catch a fuckin' ?mime?
Bitch ain't lying, so I thought you knew this
Bitch this is how I do this
(Short Dawg)
You can call eight ball in the corner when you shootin pool
But when you play the game of life, ain't no stupid rules
Gotta go for yours at all times
'Cause if you don't, nigga yours will be mine
And I won't go to bed early, won't sleep too late
And I'll never take a punk ass bitch on a date
They say Too $hort baby why you talk so bad?
Just a player ass nigga and that's all I rap about
Bitches, hoes and all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me I might call the bitch
And go diggin in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screamin, I'm gone fuck the hoe harder
Just havin' fun with the bitch, as she sprung on my dick
Guess I'll pull it out and just cum on the bitch
And from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve
And everyday in between I will do these things, I won't stop bitch

I like to go to the club mix and mingle
Nigga plays his dick like a 12 inch single

They callin me the pussy jammer 'cause I'm breakin hoes off
See I'm paid to be boss, I'm kickin back at no cost
Never slackin', just mackin, money stackin that's my motto
With so much game they want to play me like the lotto
Tip the bottle, now I'm drunk as a skunk
High off the dank, but I can't front

See I'm smooth as a nail on a fingernail file
Keepin' it wild, but in the meanwhile we the coolest

Be a hustlin motherfucker till I sees my hearse

All the young black males, that got slang yell
'Cause it's a hard life nigga only thugs survive
Ain't no love, unless a nigga slangin drugs or high
Conversations with these bitches on my mobil
Always in control and never let these bitches know ya
And even though I'm gettin' high, a thug nigga gettin' by
Catchin bitches spittin' lies, I'm gettin' mine
All day, I puff a blunt and parlay and sometimes if we party
Gettin' my dick licked twice
And death to a trick's life, we can pursue this till my shit's right
Went from havin' fantasies, to havin' hoes leave they man for me
There is no realer man than me

When them punk police tried to break me
Didn't think the shit was cute, so I got a lawsuit
And made them punk police buy my coupe

B-Legit:
I blaze blunts all day get keyed all night
Be the one to take flight if the smoke ain't right
I'm tight, nicknamed Ike for the drama
It's baby and her mama, naked in a sauna
Down with the gang 'cause them flows be hard
Blue mink, Short, and my St. Brenard
Super bad man all around Hoo-J
Tell me what the fuck happened to the groupies
Too $hort:
What happened to the groupies, I thought they was comin' through
To do everything we want 'em to
Supposed to be all good when they get here
Break niggas off, bitch we real playas
Baby in the red said ""It's coo'""
She gonna give me some pussy, and some head too
I ain't trippin' though, these bitches takin' too long
I'm bout to call some other hoes on the phone
B-Legit:
Tell 'em I'm a hog nigga, need a triple-X bitch down to stick
Turn tricks switched the dick
There's hips outside and I'm fo' sho' dat
And the finest ho she know where mo' at
Gotta show that, nigga tuck my jewels
Can't be slippin with a bitch, niggas know that shit
Hit me at the room when the hoes come
It be at 301 we callin for some
Too $hort:
Where they at B-Legit where they at? (where they at)
Let these bitches know there's some real playas back
Told her meet me in room 510 on the mattress
If you do it right then I'll be back bitch
Another showdown, in yo' town
Let everybody know you my ho now
I'm feelin' way too cool off the gin and juice
I'm bout to fuck my bitch and her friend too (and her friend too)
Captain Save-A-Hoe:
Damn, see man y'all niggas is trippin' man,
Niggas this '98 y'all actin' like its still '88
Short cussin, and all this bullshit,
Check this out--see baby and them leavin' see?
Baby come here, c'mon, baby don't even trip, just kick it for a lil while
You know what I'm sayin'? I'll take you to Sizzler to go eat after awhile
I'll make 'em stop trippin', don't even trip baby it's all good
Verse 2: Too $hort/B-Legit
Too $hort:
I'm feelin' good, everything hooked up right
Before it's all over I'ma be in som'n tight
Looked down at my hip to check my pager
Tryin' to find me a bitch, fresh off the stage
Nigga ain't hungry, fuck the after party
Told a cute groupie ""Bitch meet me in the lobby""
You know how we do it, told her bring all her friends
Next weekend we gonna do it all again
B-Legit:
I said it out my mouth on the mic real loud
We at the Holiday-Inn, room 510
Bring all the bitches even if they dikes
We hyped, hoes eatin pussy tonight
Seen her in my mug, peepin my game
Lookin' like she could take dick in the brain
We all champagne and Cali green
I need a bitch like that on a pimp team
Too $hort:
It's after midnight, can't find the right women
Can't be slippin while you're late night pimpin'
Way too many niggas got stuck like that
Waited too late then fucked a rat
Wake up in the mornin, mad as hell
With the wrong bitch in the wrong hotel
Shoulda gave up when you first struck out
Now you tryna get the fuck out
B-Legit:
Man I was drunk when I went out, blow when I woke up
Didn't get to fuck 'cause these hoes is ducks
Niggas like me need the head lay on
From bad ass bitches who prefer red bones
Rock microphones, later count G's
Could always spot a rat chasin niggas with cheese
Please, put it on freeze, it don't suit me
What happened to the muthafuckin groupies? (muthafuckin groupies)
Captain Save-A-Hoe:
What happened? nigga they all left, that's what happened
Y'all muthafuckas gonna be sittin' around all night talkin' to each other
Oh that's cool, y'all got some muthafuckin Playboy magazines
So I guess that's why y'all ain't trippin', check this out man
Y'all niggas gotta understand one thing man
Bitches don't love to be talked to like that, y'all gotta break down
Be cool with a bitch, ya know what I'm sayin'?
Show her some caring and shit, understand me?
Verse 3: B-Legit/Too $hort
B-Legit
I remember when the shit first began
I used to fuck the dog shit out my biggest fans
Four in the mornin we hit the waffle spot
Then its back to the telly for some more cock
Shit was non-stop, don't choose too fast
There's a gang of more bitches with way more ass
Up and down the hall with the bad-ass body
Groupies lookin' for the after party
Too $hort:
I used to be wild as fuck, get my dick sucked
On the back of the tour bus with two or three sluts
Check into my suite, order somethin' to eat
Knockin' at my door, its another lil freak
Right up the hall on the same flo'
You could stand in line and run a train on the ho
Top-notch or rat, skinny or fat
B-Legit, where all the groupies at? (groupies at)
B-Legit:
In the room with the tricks gettin' big faces
But they really wanna know how the dick tastes
I used to get fucked, fall asleep, wake up
Kick the bitch out and bump a freak
But nowadays, you gotta watch your route
Niggas savin' hoes need to cut that out
So what they talkin' bout, they shoulda been done came
I think they scared of a nigga with this real game
Too $hort:
What happened to the groupies, don't point your finger
They're all backstage chasin R&B singers
At the other concert, on the other side of town
I seen a few hoes but they wasn't down
Where the groupies at, I'ma ask y'all later
Probably out tryna fuck basketball players
Silly hoes, rappers got mansions
But we ain't tryna get into these tramp bitches
Captain Save-A-Hoe:
Y'all niggas is trippin' man,
Y'all need to sit down and re-evaluate your morals man
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this shit,
Y'all gonna be sittin' around in the club
Tryna figure out who goin' home with ya old ass
You need to find ya a good woman, snatch her up, get her a BMW
She got kids, only do what you do, tell her ""I got you"""

Listen and learn (Yeah-yeah)
She's all about that get rich
Treat a nigga like the lotto, he's a quick pick
... It's nothin' to a boss bitch
What happened to his cash flow? He lost it
She don't give a fuck about none of you guys
She make you look so bad, I bet you want a disguise
I knew the day and time would come
When she went out in the world and had to find her one
He sponsors all her daily, activities
I'm not her pimp, she don't pay me or give me fees
I just laced her with the game, so she could shake those lames
And try to take her change, I told her make yo' name
And turn the tables on 'em, I call her DJ Break-a-Trick
Cause all your money she'll be takin' it
Put her on the pedestal, your queen on the throne
And she's still gon' bring the money home
(Make me say oh) What she gon' do?
(Ye-yeah ye-yeah) What she gon' do?
(Make me say oh) What she gon' do?
Players better ask a bitch - bitch whatchu gon' do?
(I'll be the one to come runnin' - be the one to come runnin')
(Oh, home to you... home to you)
(You're givin' me - loooooooooooove, with a nigga like you)
(It's no need to play around, oh)
(You're more than just big pimpin')
(You're blowin' my mind with the love that you're givin')
(That's what you'll hear me say, boy every day)
I knew she had potential, to be a real player
Get paid up the ass by a millionaire
She ain't tradin sex, like these broke hoes
Her shit is worldwide, these bitches loco
She took the show on the road, for the fun and the thrills
Now it's nothin' but hundred dollar bills
She got a lot of G's, spend 'em how you please
All you broke-ass hoes, get up off yo' knees
Don't go to Hoe College if you want some mo' knowledge
Cause bitches graduate and end up with fo' dollars
You can be a hustler, and never be a baller
He tried to bread her up whenever he would call her
But the bitch was too dumb, to ask for a thang
I try to teach 'em when they young, so they don't pass on the game
And when you get your thang on
Remember where you got your game and where you came from
(Make me say oh) What she gon' do?
(Ye-yeah ye-yeah) What she gon' do?
(Make me say oh) What she gon' do?
Players better ask a bitch - bitch whatchu gon' do?
(I'll be the one to come runnin' - be the one to come runnin')
(Oh, home to you... home to you)
(You're givin' me - loooooooooooove, with a nigga like you)
(It's no need to play around, oh)
(You're more than just big pimpin')
(You're blowin' my mind with the love that you're givin')
(That's what you'll hear me say, boy every day)
It's obvious, we don't come from the same world
But you still fell in love with the game girl
Now you're, dedicated since you elevated
And you, you never hated, just celebrated
You can't play with the game, you gotta go get it
It's fire - stop drop and then roll with it
Let a baller finance your brand new car
And if he can't do more, you better kick him out the door pimpin'
Tell him how you like diamond rings
So fine, that's why he wanna buy you things
Now you spendin and shoppin', like you playin' a sport
Cause you listened to the game that you got from Uncle $hort
I'm proud of you - what you grown to be
Don't tell him nothin' - you always belong to me
You can travel the world and get your stack on
Just don't be broke when you come back home
(Make me say oh) What she gon' do?
(Ye-yeah ye-yeah) What she gon' do?
(Make me say oh) What she gon' do?
Players better ask a bitch - bitch whatchu gon' do?
(I'll be the one to come runnin' - be the one to come runnin')
(Oh, home to you... home to you)
(You're givin' me - loooooooooooove, with a nigga like you)

228,What's A Pimp?,2003,Married to the Game (2003),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Damn
Sometimes we lose some good ones mayn y'know?
They don't really understand this playerism
Just gotta break it down to 'em, keep it real y'know?
I'm a P-F-L, sworn to the P.I.
I spent so many days with you, so many nights
It's nice, I wanted you to be my only wife
We didn't make it, I couldn't take it
I tried to square up, it's too hard I couldn't fake it
And now I see why, since I was knee high
I swore to live and die by the P.I.
And I'm stayin true, born in this game and it's payin' too
I wish I could have stayed witchu
But it's over, I love you and I still care
We can kick it any time, but I'm still a player
... Damn you got that look I like
I tried to settle down it felt like you took my life
I left town, I got women all around
While I was out soul-searchin, guess what I found?
The more hoes the merrier, you think I wanna marry her?
Bitch that sounds scarier and scarier
I need to have a few wives
'Cause I don't wanna come home and tell you lies
In my heart I think I found her if she feels the same
You think I've changed, think I'd play her if I'm still in the game?
Hell yeah! One woman, I don't think so
I let the game be my wife, and I'm faithful
I never do her wrong, I never cheat on her
And if the game was baseball, I'd be on first
(I see you watchin this) I see you watchin
(I know it looks real hot up in here) It's pimpin' baby
(But what's a pimp?) Oh you know
(I say but what's a pimp?)
(They wanna be like this) They wanna be like this
(I know it looks real fly up in here) It's real fly
(But what's a pimp?)
(I say but what's a pimp?)
It's like this
I don't lie, I told you what I felt at the time
I wasn't high, I know you see yourself in my rhymes
A lot of women I dealt with, could hear these words
And realize there's no way I could still be hers
Unless you wanna share me with a hot one named Tarrie
And don't get mad at me when I'm out poppin' cherries
I know some ladies they just wanna have babies
Collect child support from rich men in Mercedes
It's cool, but that's not what players do
Get with me, those days are over, I swear it's true
You're through, havin' sex for nothin'
Hopin some day some man'll give you somethin'
Your own bank account - don't laugh, it's not funny
You only fucked with him 'cause he got a lotta money
But you never get paid, don't lie to me
You just look good, and you get to ride for free
What you eat and what you drink, you trade for sex
Pick you up in the Benz, next day in the Lex
Are you happy? Do you think you're, on a roll?
Do you love your life? Are you achievin any goals?
Or are you sad, mad cause it ain't your way?
Call mom and dad they'll be glad that you ain't gon' stay
Or call me, I got a solution
Choose me and then hit the top with your new man
[Chorus] w/ variations
I don't have fantasies, just needs
I need more than one woman to please
And she's like a love roller coaster, the thrill never lasts
And I always seem to find some better ass
Some bitch that can suck better, get wetter
She got them super skills to do anything you let her
So I'm done with you, I still care
I love you baby but I'm still a player
I always been aware and I never been scared
Found some magazines on the top they said Player$
I was young but I was old and I wanted those hoes
Found out playin' with girls was mo' fun with no clothes
You can call it what you want to, Doctor or House
Hide and Go Get It, then I'm knockin' it out
If she ain't widdit, I find another little chick
I'm quick to switch, even when I was six
I had a backup bitch, when my bitch would trip
I'd go play with my other girlfriend and get me a kiss
And at the age of thirty-six I'm to the same old tricks
Too $hort baby no the game don't quit
I'm playin' games with these lame brains
Treatin superstars, like some plane Janes
I wanna get new thangs, so I used the game to maintain
Bitch I refuse to change
[Chorus] w/ variations
(Unknown singer from Chorus)
Minks and pinky rings and them
Some so why should you begin
Livin', the world that they are perceivin
Ho-oh, is everything that you see
Really good enough to be
Part of the pimp life, oh
[Chorus] w/ variations to fade (quickly)"
229,Where They At?,2000,You Nasty (2000),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Where they at? Where they at?
Where the hoes at? Where they at?
Where the bitches at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Yeah, where they at?
Where the hoes at? Where they at?
Where the bitches at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Verse 1: (Captain Save 'Em, Too $hort)
Captain Save 'Em:
Y'all niggas always talkin' bad about a breezy,
Talkin' bout that young-ass, rich-ass nigga Too Sheezy
Always callin a woman out a name,
Callin her a ""bee-eye-itch"", now that's a shame
What if somebody called your woman that?
You'd be all up at the century club boy with your stri-nap
Talkin' bout ""I'll never save a ho"",
Then why you have that breezy drivin' your big-body benz for?
You say you only out to get some head, and then to stab,
But I see you up at Monty's feedin her lobster and crab
They say that Captain is a playa's worst enemy, so what's next?
You just mad 'cause I got more hoes than you got diamonds on your rolex
Too $hort:
I realize after makin' 6 platinums in a row
The shit was easy, so I had to get some mo'
I never did like stiff hoes,
I fuck like a rap, ain't no quick flows
I'm a California nigga, born and bred,
Got a wild imagination when I'm on the bed
I love my woman, I love her girlfriend and her sister,
Felt on her mommas booty but never kissed her
Been mackin on these hoes since the 8-0's,
It don't take much for me to break hoes
You must be dreamin', if my bitch chose you,
We in another lifetime, my game is foolproof
It won't happen, as long as she's my bitch,
I give a fuck if you fake pimps peep my shit
'Cause I'mma mack these hoes like never befo',
And every time I grab the mic I gotta better flow
Verse 2: (Too $hort)
I went from rappin' about the clothes I was wearin at a party,
To all the hoes that let me see their naked bodies
It's not an overnight transition thing,
I wasn't born pimpin' hoes wearin pinky rings
Never walked around sayin' ""Who am I?""
'Cause when I seen old movies like ""Superfly""
It was my destiny, to live a pimp legacy,
And reach levels other niggas never see
In '81 I rapped friendly, but now its on,
One day I said somethin' on the microphone
About sixteen hoes, suckin ten toes,
People loved it, that's how the story goes
It's true, in 1982,
Me and Freddy B sold the tapes to you
X-rated, talkin' bout bitches and thugs,
All the dope-dealers gettin' rich sellin drugs
Too $hort bumpin in the background,
You thought I retired, bitch I'm back now
Like a house party, or a side show,
I got the Spanish, black and white hoes
Ask an East Oakland nigga, I bet you he know,
""Is she mixed with Japanese or fillapino?""
I always spit the game when I rap,
All I wanna know is where the hoes at?"

Put your hands in the air if you're pimpin'
If youse a real player with the women
And all the ladies, stuck with a lame
$Hort Dawg'll never let 'em fuck up the game
You better break that nigga, shake that nigga
Don't wait too long girl, make it happen quicker
Choose on a real pimp, fuck that imitation
What's he gon' do when I'm up in his face and
I tell him his hoe ain't his no mo'
From here on, mind your business yo
Cause all year long, I'ma pimp this hoe
If you don't want the money what'chu in it fo'?
Stop pretendin, and be yo'self
If you had some pimp game you wouldn't need no help
You can be like us, you ain't got to front
Real players, we do what the fuck we want, now
(Too $hort)
Where the pimps at? Where the pimps at?
Where the pimps at? Where all the pimps at? Beeitch!
Where the pimps at? Where the pimps at?
Where the pimps at? Where all the pimps at?
(Too $hort)
All pimps ain't men, all hoes ain't women
Why you always braggin when you know you ain't in it
Why you so fake, man you're just a lil' wimp
Why you wanna shake hands and touch a real pimp
I heard you went to jail and got broke for your smokes
You know you ain't nothin' but a joke to my folks
If you had game, the world could be yours
But you don't even know that your girlfriend's a whore
She's good at suckin dick, make you cum quick
She's got her own website, pay her rent to click
It ain't free, and no she's not a lonely bitch
She likes to shop, I hope you're not her only trick
'Cause if you fuck with her
You're not her man, you're just a customer
Cain't even hang with the boys
All the real pimps make some noise
(Too $hort)
Where the pimps at? Where the pimps at?
Where the pimps at? Where all the pimps at? Beeitch!
Where the pimps at? Where the pimps at?
Where all the pimps at? All the pimps in the house make some noooise
(Kool Ace)
Ye-yeah, hey hey
Yeah baby, all that we have seen
On the TV screen about, all that we have dreamed of
Is not before you, real pimps own game
Real macks on this
It's Mr. Real Feel Pimpin' at you once again
Game done changed but I'm still at them Benjamins
So break bread hoe, huh, get too it honey
Make it rain in this bitch like Hurricane Money
Big macks on 'gnacs now get your {?} on deck
We breakin bitches in Hollywood with them big fat checks
It ain't hard for you to fit in, go do the figures
You fuckin' with gator legends some, some bigger niggaz
Mack A-C-E, in 3-D
Representin this motherfuckin P-I-M-P

In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
With his gansta waves and gangsta hoods
He made friends with dealers and crooks
And when the party was on you knew he had come
It is like Gladis Knight and its five oh ones
Walking right up to the DJ man
And give another emcee's rap
'Cause they knew about him and his gangsta rap
The fact they just couldn't manage that
He was known around to be the best
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
In a land where whips will watch the car
Tell you everything and they still want more
Where live is only give and take
In a land where the strong control the fake
He was known around for all the time
Everybody went wild when he said his rhyme
Said his manly man would come out
With his gangsta ride his turn back side
Out like Jessie Jackson in a land
Where game that controls the lane
Yes the wild wild west that's the place
Suckers take a bite and don't even taste
The California lifestyle that I live
When the sun rolls out every chance it get
The wild wild west that's where you see
Emcee rappers make you look like wheat
'Cause you would never hang in the wild wild west
Without you hoopsta in the wild wild west
You can get down but I don't know where
You come out here you better act scare
'Cause we don't play don't come my way
When you sudden didn't fight you will say
Front me 'cause you'll front yourself
I'll leave you standing there mad as that
You can rap your best that's what you do
You just can't hang and you know its true
Like a homeboy said its one two three
West coast raps to the beat
You got have a lot of game to spit that rap
I wanna put a little game to her just like that
Too $hort I thought you knew
You can't count three and then skip two
It just won't work but you might high
You the emcee from seventy five

With his non stop rapping and his west coast style
He had the whole dang party just going wild
Singing rhymes all time banging back
Turning eight out with the west coast rap
That's when the sucker emcee all came to be
Nothing but everyday sucker emcee's
They were all his friends all his fans
Walk right up and make his man
And you always knew every time
Sucker emcee's wish they could rhyme
Just like pimp but what's the fact
The fact they just couldn't get with that
They were all frustrated all mapped out
Didn't even know what to rap about
Homeboy do you agree
And not worth kicking like a sucker emcee
'Cause much talk fresh and all them mad
Sucker emcee's couldn't make him mad
With a rap like his a rap like that
Now its time for a sucker to rap
The sucker emcee would just wait his turn
Sucker emcee's don't want to get burned
What emcee do you play
He had the sucker emcee's all running away
Didn't want none you couldn't get them back
They never could deal with a real big mack
One emcee was the best

There was one emcee who knew the tip
And the sucker emcees don't even trip

So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
Just a true emcee didn't cash the checks
Singing that's like this or raded that
Making a champ with a heavy weight rap
No emcee could walk like that
To a point that paid again and again
Saying wouldn't stop till he got a benz
I never thought about it till the other day
He had drop chop rolling away
In a eighty five or eighty seven
Said he got paid 'cause he raps like this
You could see it in his eyes he was seeing stars
Choosing folks and having things
Just checking out the girls walking down the street
In the wild wild west that's where you see
The freshest emcees you will say is soft
From seventy five girl so raw
Like silky they and Hollywood
They come so fresh 'cause you know they could
Like sir Too $hort when I'm on the mic
West coast rappers rap all long night
So watch how you talk in the wild wild west
East coast rappers make us look fresh
With the save a hoe and everybody scream
East coast rappers make all the cream
With a New York rap and a New York slang
Not too many could spit that game
Now the time has come and I'll tell it right
About a rapper like me who will rock the mic
I'm making you wake up on the western coast
Were giving you more than just the locs
Its everything you could never have
Took and spent your money to buy my rap

And you always knew every time
Sucker emcee's wish they could rhyme
Just like pimp but what's the fact
The fact they just couldn't get with that
They were all frustrated all mapped out
Didn't even know what to rap about
Homeboy do you agree
And not worth kicking like a sucker emcee
'Cause much talk fresh and all them mad
Sucker emcee's couldn't make him mad
With a rap like his a rap like that
Now its time for a sucker to rap
The sucker emcee would just wait his turn
Sucker emcee's don't want to get burned
What emcee do you play
He had the sucker emcee's all running away
Didn't want none you couldn't get them back
They never could deal with a real big mack
One emcee was the best
So rough and tough in the wild wild west
There was one emcee who knew the tip
And the sucker emcees don't even trip
So tell it to the world it's not to wise
'Cause you are an emcee from seventy five
Girls G.I.R.L.S. so fresh
Emcee rap through the wild wild west
Taking you the weed 'cause we don't play
Sucker emcee's do you hear me say
Front me... front me...
Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
Just a true emcee didn't cash the checks
Singing that's like this or raded that
Making a champ with a heavy weight rap
No emcee could walk like that
To a point that paid again and again
Saying wouldn't stop till he got a benz
I never thought about it till the other day
He had drop chop rolling away
In a eighty five or eighty seven
Said he got paid 'cause he raps like this
You could see it in his eyes he was seeing stars
Choosing folks and having things
Just checking out the girls walking down the street
In the wild wild west that's where you see
The freshest emcees you will say is soft
From seventy five girl so raw
Like silky they and Hollywood
They come so fresh 'cause you know they could
Like sir Too $hort when I'm on the mic
West coast rappers rap all long night
So watch how you talk in the wild wild west
East coast rappers make us look fresh
With the save a hoe and everybody scream
East coast rappers make all the cream
With a New York rap and a New York slang
Not too many could spit that game
Now the time has come and I'll tell it right
About a rapper like me who will rock the mic
I'm making you wake up on the western coast
Were giving you more than just the locs
Its everything you could never have
Took and spent your money to buy my rap
The wild wild west that's what its called
About the west coast rappers that stand so tall
The freshest emcees you'll say you saw
From seventy five girl so raw
Wild wild west"

(Chorus 2X: Petey Pablo + N.O.R.E.)
Can't fuck with us! Every car that we in
Can't fuck with us! You see it's somethin' like a sin
Can't fuck with us! Man, you gotta show love
Can't fuck with us! Pimp player gangster or thug
(N.O.R.E.)
Yo, I'm Too $hort to bitches, fuckin' with Poppalicious
Nore holdin' it down and bust biscuits (buck buck buck)
New York crime scene things get risk-us (uh oh)
Until I fuckin' grow them old man whiskers, I'ma
Stay on the block like Rocky, I'm papi
Throwin' batteries in the sock and rock aqui
Noreaga plus I got my Famous Player card
Himalaya, who the mayor, bitches St. Bernard - shit
Stuck in love, since you got doo-doo
Until I met Good Game and Pimp JuJu
Taught me how to sell mooshu, in a Azuzu
Go hard, thinkin' you hard, I'm Monster Cody-ium
At the Hip-Hop Summit, catch 'em at the podium
But yo, you know how that go, gotta make the papes so
Pimpin' on a bitch hard, never catch a case doe
Boot to your side, to your back, to your face
(Petey Pablo)
As I'm rollin' with my homey down on the side
Petey Pab', Short Dawg in a low-ride
'Bout to take a trip up to the Eastside
Whattup Nore? Give your boy half on a hoe pie
I love to rock the crowd
Take my shirt off, let my chest bounce around
Got missin' for a minute but I'm back now
Time to give some of these sissies here the hush mouth
You've been waitin and anticipatin oh-so-long
Starvin like Marvin for a Petey song
Tired of Carolina bein stepped on, stepped over
Next time, I'ma get the award
Or I'ma beat the nigga ass who won
I ain't gon' wait for the camera to cut
I'ma light him up
Dem jab, right cross, dem uppercut
Y'all niggaz can't fuck with us, a huh huh, huh huh
(Too $hort)
I'm doin' donuts at the light, I ain't got no sense
I drive crazy, 'cause they can't stop no pimp
On my way to nowhere, drivin' hella fast
And every time I see a cop, I give it hella gas
I swerved doin' 40 in a curve
But I whiffed them other suckers still smokin' on my herb
Man I got this, now I'm doin' 60 on a backstreet
Knowin' this hound wants to lick me
She won't give up, I keep goin'
You wonder how these old-ass hoes keep hoein
It's the game; that's what I put in these women
From the beginnin to the endin
That's why these old-ass pimps keep pimpin'
And these broke-ass hoes be limpin
Cain't get right, fucked up your life
Nigga mad he ain't ballin tonight
(Too $hort)
(Can't fuck with us!) Can't fuck with me
(Can't fuck with us!) Can't fuck with the real ones nigga

236,You Might Get G'eed,1999,Can't Stay Away (1999),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"You know it ain't over
I said it back in '82
I'll be a player for life
I'll never say I do
I done tramped bitches
That most niggaz would marry
I like to pimp bitches and
Most niggaz be scary
Get a bad bitch
And you can't say no
You're at the mall buyin shit you can't pay for
Then you wonder why all these hoes wanna switch
Best friend on the under
Fuckin' your bitch...
Pussy you ain't cared 'bout that when you had her
But now you wonder where she's at
I know your heart broke
But it don't show
'Cause all I heard from your mouth
Was ""fuck that ho.""
But deep down inside I know it hurts a lot
I know you can't go on but it's worse to stop
You daydreamin 'bout your x, tryin' to figure what's next
Other females can't compare to her sex
I'm tryin' to picture me, all in love with these hoes
But when I meet 'em, they just wanna lick my balls
You can't tell me shit, fuck that
You're just another fine ass bitch with nut breath
I met you on Friday, I fucked you on Saturday
I can't hold back bitch I'm still rollin' that way
Carry you across the threshold in my new house?
You better try to stick this big dick in your mouth, bitch"
237,You Nasty,2000,You Nasty (2000),Hip Hop,Too $hort,"Beeyotch!
You nasty, you nasty bitch
That's what I said bitch (you nasty)
I said you nasty (you nasty)
Fuck that shit, fuck you hoes (you nasty)
Fuck all y'all, man
I used to get straight A's, read my books in Catholic school,
Now I find myself in the men's bathroom
With a top-notch, goin' wild in the stall,
She ain't even trippin' 'cause she's havin' a ball
I used to play with my toys in the back yard,
But now I just walk around and act hard
Alot of women like to be called a bitch,
I'll break it down so you understand all of it
I always thought I was an educator,
I might not love her, but I never hate her
She's the kind of girl to make your toes pop,
Keep ya wide open, never need nose drops
Now y'all wanna get mad at me,
For talkin' about another young, nasty freak
Its life, it's not a major catastrophe,
You ain't a ho 'cause you givin' up the ass for free, you nasty
I know why y'all mad at me, I ain't break your heart girl (you nasty)
Man, these bitches trippin' (you nasty)
Too many tight lil dresses with no panties on,
Too many females tryin' to take a man home
Where your mommy and your daddy at?
Just because a player got a cadillac
You wanna lay in the back, with your face in his lap,
All you gotta do is taste that
You get to ride, get used all the time,
I ain't made the situation I just made the rhyme
Adapt to my surroundings, look around
Nothin' but pimps, tricks, and hookers found
In the Town, if you ain't one you the other,
I ain't fooled, what you gonna do to a brother
Lookin' at me, like you wanna eat me,
Didn't even have to use words to meet me
Now we havin' sex and I forgot your name,
You just a hot thang, nothin' can't stop your game, 'cause you nasty
I already fucked you (you nasty)
I don't know why you trippin' (you nasty)
I told y'all I was gonna call you (you nasty)
After awhile
I understand where your anger comes from,
'Cause I've been talkin' bad on the mic since day one
Never took the time to explain myself,
But keepin' it real is somethin' I can't help
I know some real women, I know some real hoes,
And male-bashing songs, I don't feel those
But I'm glad you bi-sexual women came out,
Don't tell 'em what we did and keep my name out your mouth
If it wasn't for the groupies or for the oral sex they gave me,
I'd treat you all like ladies
I'm just a victim of society,
Look me in my eyes and don't lie to me
You ever had a one-night stand and go to church the next day?
A full night of play, wake up and pray
Wishin you could stay, but you caint'
Oh you a good girl today? You ain't no saint, you nasty
Oh yeah I know I fucked you too (you nasty)
You know what I'm talkin' bout?
You need to take this muthafuckin opportunity
And have some big fun (you nasty)
I got some drinkin' in the kitchen baby (you nasty)
My niggas comin' through (you nasty)
Oh, its cool girl (you nasty)
We gon' work this shit out, beeyotch!
I ain't mad at y'all
I ain't mad at you
Shit, I ain't mad
'Cause you nasty"
