0,1/2 & 1/2,1999,Full Clip: A Decade Of Gang Starr (1999),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"(Lil Fame)
Here comes the revolutionist, executionist
Flip a triple six into three nines, cause a crucifix
Each man holdin', no man foldin
Coast is clear and Premier's in the green tank rollin'
Prepare, get on your post and stand clear
They wantin to shut us down but the home team's here
What? You act like you're sweet or something
This ain't no Desert Storm bullshit war, we all dumpin
CODENAME, Jamel wit non-strap
Wit six clips of teflon, suited in camoflagued
Got kevlar helmets wit masses
Wearin mob gear in 'cause they try to infumigate us wit gases
MISSION--to seek and destroy
We were sent to get rid of you, make the situation critical
First Family will gradually, lift that ass up like gravity
And turn your body frame into a cavity
NFO--that's No Fair Ones
Watch me nine milly turn into a flare gun
Sparkin wit the same marksman
Known for gunnin and runnin' and bombin
Wit the ?lyrics? squeeze of my gun barkin, YA HEARD!
You know my family style
I'm goin' out wit my gun in my hand like Big Mal
I ain't got nuttin to lose, so move on me if there's something to prove, fool
This is war
[Prodigy] ""There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from""
""So what you gonna do since you know now""
[Guru] ""There's a war goin' on outside"" ""It's impossible to stop""
(Guru)
This world's a twisted maze, but I got the swiftest blades
My swords they can slice and dice precise ways
Those who come against me, can get blazed, sprayed and laid
No trace, just a glimpse of my face, hittin the shade
You look up, there's a full moon in the sky
And all my would-be enemies, yeah they're soon to die
Livin' in this warzone, we frequent fly at home
Many of us grow violent prone, ain't tryin' to be dyin' alone
So I'ma take the competition wit me, Lord forgive me
But a whole bunch, of blood-suckin punks, is out to get me
In a flash of a moment, I slash vital components
Tryin' to scheme on me and my team bitch, you know we own this
We can scrap, wit guns, knives, chains and bats
Whatever baby, erase that ass quick fast off the map
Plus they better bring, medical attention after I swing my weapon
Won't be no recovery, no divine intervention
No prevention, from gettin' hung in the streets where I'm from
'Nuff blood shed, this war's just begun
(Chorus scratched and cut up x2)
(Billy Danze)
How many predators out there that want me
That's how I stand off, NOW
I come to diminsh every one of you blood suckers
Hands off, lay 'em down NOW
ALL CULPRITS, be alarmed
First Officer Danze reportin for 'Nam
When I'm bringin' the storm, I'm all in
Yes I done stepped in the chest of many men
THEN AGAIN, it's a part of my persona like puff stumps and marijuana
IIAAAH, ?soutch? 'em out, FIRE
>From all angles, that's how we was trained
Either slay or be slain, it's in the game for my soul
To be as cold as the blood in my vein
Knowin' my name, help niggas perform abnorm
FIRST FAMILY, let's get it on
Just keep in mind I'm a marksman, I'm sensitive about that there
So you better watch what you say to me, hear?
PLAY WIT EM fierce, know where to run
So I post and defend, forgive me Father I may sin
And thou shall remember the code of the street
(Hold heat), roll deep, (don't sleep) or you'll be murdered
Since I've arrived I learned how to survive on this earth
Holdin' down this turf, now I declare WAR!
""There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from""
""It's impossible to stop"" (Yeah!)
""There's a war goin' on outside"" ""It's impossible to stop""
""No man is safe"" ""There's a war goin' on outside"""
1,2 Deep,1992,Daily Operation (1992),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Verse One
I'm 2 deep and yes much too complicated
My lines when stated are quite often underrated
So consider it a privilege to hear this
Those weak-minded opinions could never come near this
For my outlook on life is a profound view
Whil the suckers act down thinking that they sound new
Only a few sound true
Me and the crew know who
'Cause you see me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
Giving you the time to get your wack-ass style down
You punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
Knowing that hard is something you can't be
So you front but you could never call my bluff
'Cause you'll catch hell you'll get dealt with
I never sleep
I always peep
Rhymes creep
I'm 2 Deep
I'm 2 Deep...
Verse Two
I forgive you sike I'm takin' your life
'Cause you continue to disrespect so I'ma get trife
But then again I think I'll spare ya
'Cause I know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya
See I'm the holder of the key
Don't ask me if I'm Muslim don't say nothin' to me
I said I was raised like one son I had two cousins
They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn't
Gonna make it and then end up a statistic
My life was twisted I almost missed it
The chance yes the chance to make you feel good
I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I'm me
And the nation of Islam has my support
'Cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
And the 5 percent nation takes other steps
To get through to brothers on the corners with the reps
And in the prison they give the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream
Of a total different scene I dress clean, stand lean
Say what I mean and I'm out
Like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout
Verse Three
For right now yo my religion is rhyming
Perfect timing test the flow and climb in
Ansaar, Sunnite, Sheite, Jihad
All must regard the times are hard
Unite or perish
Is the message I cherish
That goes for my people of all religions
If we're all black why have so many divisions
Superficial factors are drawing us apart
Don't let it happen
Let's put some respect back in
So before I act I think 'cause it's the brink of destruction
Word corruption what's up son your gun is just one
And I just might have one
Or two or maybe even three or four
And plus an army of 100 or more
But violence is never my first choice
I come in peace to release the effect of my voice"
2,2 Steps Ahead,1989,No More Mr. Nice Guy (1989),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"(Guru)
Chumps tryin' me, but when they eyein me
I build in skills, and to enhance my chances
I'm thrilled, to be involved with solvin
All the problems, with the way that the sound
Has gone down, so I frown at the scene
Where you be takin' it, and like the winds of change
I'll be breakin it up, shakin it up
Clearing it out, airing it out, and bearing the clout
On my chest, like a crest that rests
On a tidal wave, only the good I'll save
When I plunge, and engulf the ones
Who aren't sons, who converse with ? and make friends
Yo, I recommend that you get back there
And sit back there, contemplate, calculate
And concentrate on these rhymes, that I picked to stick
To your mind, and then I'll raise you straight
To the next phase, 'cause I will amaze
With much force, and like the power that comes
From the source, which is greater and stronger, of course
If you didn't know, I will tell you
That all the blind no-minds I give Hell to
And if you comprehend what is said
Then you'll be stayin two steps ahead
""One, two"" steps ahead
""One, two"" steps ahead
""One, two"" * cut and scratched by Premier *
(Guru)
I can't work with, those jerks who front
With the mic, 'cause I never liked fabrications
Wack creations that lack authenticity
For some time in my mind I've been wishin the
Fiends who do would just yield
And at the foot of my bed, I have kneeled
Thus revealed as a gift I have nurtured
And I hurt ya if you're not knowin'
That the musical need is now growin'
And like a man obsessed, I must
Go all out, show all out, blow all out
Throw all out, get on out of my path
'Cause I laugh at the ones with no gas
I surpass the class to get geesed
Like the way the ballistic's released
And I won't cease till I cap them
Or slap the saps with my rappin'
Continue on with my journey
All the negative ones don't concern me
My eyes are wise, I got cause to live
Positive, have to give, every way
Every day of my life, so I fight for the right
And get hype, so heed what I feed
And get fed, then you'll be livin' two steps ahead
""One, two"" steps ahead
""One, two"" steps ahead
""One, two"" * cut and scratched by Premier *
(Guru)
I'm way ahead of you, yes I'm on top
It's me instead of you, with the lyrics you fear it
So get near it, and then you'll hear it clear
And concise, 'cause I paid the price to be
Talking here, rocking there, shocking here
Stop and stare, then compare if you wish
Because the others fess, I insist
So I will assist you to blend with this
Bend with this, tend with this, fend with this
As I ascend with my orals
You define and defy with high morals
And at the spot I will stop to throw darts
At the ones who proclaim with no aim
'Cause they don't hold the fame, they're on mine
And since I'm well inclined and divine
I will have to ask you to come in
Move along with the tongue and the drummin
Progress and let the blessings be read
And you'll be staying two steps ahead
""One, two"" steps ahead
""One, two"" steps ahead
""One, two"" * cut and scratched by Premier *"
3,ALONGWAYTOGO,1994,Hard To Earn (1994),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"(Phife from ""Check the Rhime"") Now here's a funky introduction
(Scratching)
Guru: chorus 1 (2X):
It's ALONGWAYTOGO, when you don't know where you're going
You don't know where you're going when you're lost (lost)
Guru:
What you need is more direction and get yourself some protection
I thought by now that you have learned your lesson
I'm stressin points and slammin' all joints you call the real shit
Correct shit, you know the busta way you feel shit
Baby, I still don't think you understand
You lose the game, we get more props than Dan... Rather
And it don't matter 'cause when you flinch, you're weak
So I'mma step just to speak about the counterfeit, unlegit type of people
Those cellophane ones, the ones that you can see through
It's poetic justice 'cause I'm mad with a pact
So precise, my insight will take flight in the night
And in the daytime, 'cause I don't come up with corny rhymes
I'm too devoted to the concept of gettin' mine
So here's the deal like Shaquille O'Neal
If you don't know what you're doing, how the hell can you be real?
(Scratching) (Q-Tip from ""Check the Rhime"") How far must you go to gain
Respect? Um...
Guru:
Now in '93, realistically you should be... well aware of all the evils out
There
It's like a jungle sometimes. You get the message?
You got to rumble sometimes, it's gettin' hectic
Emotions run deep, as times run out
Solutions... it's time to find some out
So according to me, suckers are barred
>From obstructing my discussion 'cause I rhyme too hard
You take a wiff like a spliff here, like some fresh air
I came to claim shit this year (this year)
So take a stroll down the walkway, or hallway, or runway
Fuck with us, kid, you'll pay
I slay... and yo, I'm still on the expressway
I kick my essay, then you know we don't play
So pray down on your knees, G
'Cause it's the best way, yes, the best way, 'cause...
Guru:
There's a large amount of wack crews. For them, I got bad news
Time to pay your dues, you fools
I'm like express mail, with the script that hits
Like the third rail, when I shock the spot, it's hot
>From the rays of the sun
Original one the prophet sent to become
A law giver, 'cause you shiver when I quiz ya
All about the real necessities of life
All about the game and all about the name
G to the A to the N to the G Starr
We know who we are, but do you know who you are?
(Richard Pryor: You go down there looking for justice, that's what you
Find, just us)
(Scratching) Um... (until end)"

""It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is LOOSE...
Somewhere in outer space.""
""The mysteries of creation are there.""
""Up in the sky?"" ""Up in the sky.""

""Prepared for liftoff.""
(Guru)
I Self Lord And Master, shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwake, causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
And watch another C-Cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
Heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin' a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
Like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combine, over the frontline
The ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid
(Chorus: Guru)
Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
Reigning/raining down, holdin' it down
(Inspectah Deck)
Yeah; I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
But our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin'
When we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with
Humungous effect in the world - we could have conquered it"

'Here's how it goes..'
(Guru)
All for the cash man, niggaz'll be ready to blast man
Mad hoes,'ll be quick, to give up the as* man
Traitors, they'll be robbing your stash man
Don't wanna end up like the last man
If the price is right, niggaz can get trife awright
They plot and they scheme, all day and all night
And they might even get elaborate enough
To plan the illest kind of crime, fuck the average stuff
Like this chick who was kickin it, with this baller
Pretendin that she loved him, only really loved dollars
Holla'd at his man so they could, rendezvous
Said to his man, 'Forget him, I'm fond of you'
So after the screw, she put him down with her plan
The utmost betrayal, this nigga's down with her man
But the sex changed everything, they conspired to snake him
Talked about the best time, and best way, they could take him
While in bed, she told him just where her man kept his dough
She said, 'Yo, tonight he's bout to cop some blow
And I know, there's at least, 50 grand to show
Bring a gat, wear a mask, and come through the window
I'll leave it open for you, he won't never know
So run in, grab the money, later on, you and I can flow
If we do this shit right, he won't fight
Break out with the cash and stay your as* out of sight'
So the nigga sat back, but little did he know
He was about to ruin his life over a silly hoe
And really though, the whole shit went wrong
'Cause when he came through the window and pulled out it was on
Money they was gon' rob was high, on some shit
Dukes with the mask, told him, 'Run your shit'
He said, 'fuck that shit!' So they tussled 'n' shit
Then BLAOW, the burner spit, and the chick's man got hit
He died, his man had no loyalty, she's locked up as an accessory
His man's doin' life, what a tragedy
All for the cash man...
'Never have to run'"

(Guru)
Parahraphs, portraying my viewpoint
So stay attentive, cause this is a new joint
From the G-A-N-G with the info
Lyrical elements emerge from the intro
Forming a poetic mass over pathetic trash
Other writers are outclassed
Surpassed by the words and the wit
Rhymes fit and hit cause that's how we designed it
Page for page, we are the new age
Dope in the videos and dope when we're on stage
Commanding respect with my ink pen while suckers are sinking
As I'm keeping them thinking
Narrating phrases of value, and I can see now you
Relate to what I create
From back in the days of my youth, I've looked for the truth
And yo my rhymes are the real proof
New heights and new realms have been reached
By use of my speech along with one of Premier's beats
So listen and we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A
(DJ Premier cuts and scratches again)
(Guru)
Worshipful words giving insight, so just be observant
So you can get this right
My oratory gift is abundant, so dazzling to minds
That you should come get
A glimpse of the one who puts wimps out of work
The script is a mess and they dress like they're jerks
Beyond them, is where I'll be dwellin
The Guru will tell em, why their records ain't sellin
Placin' my fingers on the tool, I runaway all fools
When I'm dispersin a verse
Think of an enjoyable moment, then boogie your body
Cause this party I own it
The origin of this is on paper
Vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
I go with the flow as I show expertise
The powers increase as my voice hits the streets
Then gripping your soul with authority
I pour these rhymes in a cup so drink up
And then I might bring another round
Watch the sound pound from the floor to the ground
And keep aware, 'cause we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A"
9,B.I. Vs. Friendship,1998,Moment Of Truth (1998),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"*GangStarr's ""Who's Gonna Take the Weight?"" plays in the background*
(Guru)
It's like, a friendship, and a business partnership
And, we have to always be conscious of the difference
Between em; because y'know, some things can happen
That'll ruin one or the other, so
We alwa-we always stay conscious of those things
Those obstacles that can, y'know trip us up
Because we ain't trying to go out like that
*Primo scratching fades in gradually*
""Friends"" ""business"" (repeat 3X)

C'mon! Motherfucker! Yeah! ...
GangStarr! GangStarr! M.O.P.
Ghetto people!
(Guru)
Son you're supposed to be my man, but you ain't wise enough to realize
This is B.I., see I wanna taste the whole cake
Some things in this industry, shit be so fake
Make no mistake, if you're my man you'd understand
About the plan, to stack hundreds of grands (That's right!)
And how to stand, on much more acres of land
And to expand from the days of goin' hand to hand
So like I was CEO I do my thing son
And turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom
Release a fistful, of rhymes for the fiscal year
MC's are wishful fuckin' with this here
They stuck with the tear, for fear they foresake a brother's love
It's clear -- I'd have to be the better man I'm thinkin'
The 7th Letter Man ain't got no time for petty speakin' (uh)
So we go our separate ways I see the fork in the road
I know I blessed you with a portion of gold
And some good fortune to hold, so KEEP THAT
While I keep it movin, just like truckloads
Of interstate cargo, taxin niggaz like U.S. embargoes
You my man like I said so all the best
You shoulda known we do shit differently than all of the rest
Can't afford to let a link be, loose in the chain
It's time for us to get mad more, juice in the game
You're buggin son (that's right) that's word to Billy and Fame
So I'ma stay the game, that we play to win (Yeah!)
So I don't care what you say to her or say to him
The object son, is to excel and lead
And niggaz be bluffin fallin' for nothin' but greed
Chorus: M.O.P. and Guru
[M.O.P.] If it's animosity
[Guru] Let me know
[M.O.P.] If you plottin to stop my dough
[Lil' Fame] Time to go!
[M.O.P.] GangStarr, M.O.P. nigga
[Billy Danze] Tryin' to blow!
[M.O.P.] If you my man you could understand!
*Repeat 2X*
(Lil' Fame)
I'm true to myself y'all, and I'm a down ass nigga!
So don't fool yourself, clown ass nigga!
I always been the type of cat that'll put it on ya
Since back in the days when Laze snatched me off the corner
And every since then, the whole game changed
Everybody's against, Lil' ass Fame
They wanna see me stretched out with my back smokin'
Left for dead in the street with my back opened
So I don't keep friends I just roll with
Niggaz I was RAISED WITH, went out in a BLAZE WITH
In the penile, to B.ville, down to Grayson
And we thick together, in these last days kid
So I don't have what you call friends
'Cause when it's on then they gone in the end!
But I'ma handle my business indeed
Cause niggaz be bluffin fallin' for nothin' but greed!
(Billy Danze)
Hey yo what happened to the love soldier? It never crossed my mind
That you would doubt my love inside and test my pride
I divide, anything that I got
With my M.O.P. staff -- WE ALL AND WE OUT!
To the First Family loyalty, is no game
We them type of niggaz that, money won't change
We all aim, for the big picture
But to me it don't mean shit if your dogs ain't witcha
I sacrifice my main arteries -- WHY NIGGA?!
Ain't nobody never loved me, like my niggaz
See my business is my friendship and my friendship is my business
Can I get a witness?! (Preach on nigga!)
Hey yo we went through all out wars, half-assed tours
Travelled 'cross this land with heavy contraband
(See you my man!) And you ain't never got to
Second guess or question the love of William Danze (Sho' nuff!)
I am invaluable, to my niggaz
'Cause they all rest there in thirty-two -- BETTER THAN NOTHIN'!
Think of William when they start bustin', I hold you down
(When them body parts pop up cousin) I'll be around!

Intro (phone conversation):
Yo what up son?
-Yo what up kid?
Yo, you holdin' your head up?
-I'm tryin' to man, but the system is shady
Word man they always man, they always tryin'
To keep a good brother down, but I'm sayin'
We still, you know we got love for you son
And we prayin' for you and we, you know
We tryin' to hold it down wh
You know while you in there man
-No question
Hopefully they won't keep you in there for too long
-Yeah, for real, I sure love be out in a minute, you know?
-But you know what I want you to kid? You know what would
-Be the bomb man?
What's that?
-You need to do some shit with Face man
-Bomb on niggaz, be shady man
Scarface?
-Yeah man
Yo that's my nigga, yaknowwhaImean
-Scarface is tight son
Yo that's a good idea word is bond
I'm gonna talk the play in tomorrow (yeah) and
See about if we could hook up wit him
-That's proper
Hook: Guru
Scandalous, money greed and lust
In this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust
Plus there's no justice, it's just us
In fact, watchin' yo back it be must
And each and everyday around the way gats bust
And jealous so-called friends'll try to set you up
It's called betrayal
Verse 1: Guru
Check the horror scene
The kid was like twelve or thirteen
Never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
Watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
Nothin' but blood everywhere, these streets are mean
They spared his life, but killed his moms and his sister Jean
Of course over some drug shit
His pops was on some ill-out, spill your guts, on some thug shit
Didn't know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
His pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
Cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him doe
And taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle, fam and all that
He could tell it was him 'cause he wore the same slacks, he wore when
He took him to Meadowlands racetrack
Why did he flip and go out like that?
It's called betrayal
Verse 2: Scarface
A Betrayal
Punk ass niggas
It's called betrayal
He on a mission to become a ball player
Flip big Benz's, flossin all gators
Had it all mapped out,6-8,12th grader
Fresh outta school, he filn' to go lay paper
He had a brother who was hustlin collection his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin' as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under neighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumpin
So now he's sittin' on the sidewalk bleedin
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin in the world ain't goin' to bring him back
His brother, sittin' at the wake wipin tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin' the price
While he's starin' at the shell
His brothers soul wants hell the trigger man made bail
And you, wouldn't pay the boys mail, and sacrificed the fuckin' family
That's betrayal

15,Beyond Comprehension,1991,Step In The Arena (1991),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Expanding the depth of your brainpower
Ours is a better gift, not to be bragging nor lolligagging
I can see dimensions of sound and light around my mic
Transmitting lyrics like teletype
Reacting to a beat in a whisper
And like a transistor, I'm sounding dope when I'm crisper
The shortest length between two points is a straight line
I've gotta take mine, I heard it through the grapevine
That some can't find hype lines (hype lines...)
And so I'm smothering, over my prey I am hovering
Suckers I'm shoving at the same time covering
You with the blanket of some language that's distinguished
How swift can I get? You ask and I'll tell
For I can excel real well like a gazelle
Past your head, I'm grabbin abstract thought
Like some gain glory, while others get no part
I feel for the hurt ones, the victims of wrong deeds
Awareness is key, our people have strong needs
Science, math, history theology
Philosophy psychology English and biology
Et cetera, and all of these have a purpose
But genocide makes me nervous
So many questions, many opinions to mention
And damn (damn...) this jam's beyond comprehension
Like planets in orbit, we ride the life cycle
Some take a rifle on the street cause it seems neat
Whatever turns you on I guess, that's why vests are in season
I'll do my show then I'm leavin'
I'd rather be blastin dope sounds on the other side of town
Than be there when they close the place down
But anyway, everyday, there's another way
For a person to just flip, so a brother may
Simply go buckwild, get crazy and mad
I know the struggle my father had
Poetry it comes from within, and will always win
Hold captive bodies from end to end
And at a party, I'll survey then slay with the quickness
Displaying the fitness
Easing the mind and relieving the tension
And singing my own song... that's beyond comprehension"

Ah so now ya got me pissed off, blast off lift off
Time for me to twist off a vocal fist off
Into your domepiece, Homepeace, I heard your chick wants to bone me
I get, wild like rugby, respected like Bugsy
Don't even ask me, 'cause I'm livin' lovely
Born to succeed, foes bleed, true indeed
The oral combat will romp that, your one of my seeds
When I first, busted on the scene
Nigga, you knew I had more than a gangsta lean
I mean my lean is gangsta though so check it
I'll stick an MC for his spot and sign in blood on his wack record
Boo-ya-ka, to your face as I ruin ya
Clown ya, dumbfound ya, while I'm screwin the
Fuck out cha girl as she steps into my world
I'm not the tallest, but that ass I'll polish
And if the hooker runs her mouth she gets cut off
But then you'll sweat her, cause like my leather you're butter soft
Your style stinks kid, ya garbage
And if you keep talkin' shit, I'ma make ya pay homage
Cause the G to the you to the R-U, came too far to
Let you slide through, rhymes will scar you
And who the fuck are you anyway?
I catch more wreck in a minute than if you rhyme for ten days
Throw the cash in the pot
You betta dash nigga, 'cause I'm blowin' up the spot
""I'm bout to blow the fuck up""

No ex-capin the explosion, those who are dozin, I close in
Set the thermostat at sub-zero, they're frozen
Extreme temperatures from my mic, stuns amateurs
Unable to conquer the Gang, I ain't mad at cha
Peace to Jeru, the Big Shug and the Group Home
Keepin' it real, no playin' niggaz or chrome
I'm way past the kid shit, brothers already did shit
You want some props? Yo dog, here's a biscuit
I'm a smooth nigga and my groove's bigga, move nigga
And we don't care who's wit cha, got the picture?
And you don't wanna hear the burners go pop
Gang Starr motherfucker, what, blowin' up the spot
""I'm bout to blow the fuck up""
* Premier scratches *
(Guru)
I go from one format then switch to the next
Reflex sets the pitch vocals rip through projects
Crazy shouts are heard all around
Cause the GangStarr sound carries more weight per pound
I got some brand new Timbs, so emcees sing new hymns
You betta repent, come correct, represent
Or get stomped, smacked and slapped, cap peeled back
I got you open, and now you cling to my sac
Get off, hands off, stay off, you're way off
You rookie motherfuckers it's the finals not the playoffs
I'll break you up into particles, to small pieces
Because your brain is miniscule
You little fool, come learn the tools of the trade
I made the rules so go to school and get played
Just when you're thinkin' that your jam is hot
Up steps the niggaz who be blowin' up the spot"

One two checka, get, down and dirty
And my sounds are worthy of respect
So I'ma flex my text just like a, major takeover
Chumps pass the mic over
Growin' more and more nervous when I serve this ass whoopin
Comin' straight out of Brooklyn, baldhead from the old school
Born to rule with more class than Billy Dee
To a pussy emcee, you know a wuss emcee
I'm like his worst nightmare when I'm on my killin' spree
Pick the vic, who will it be?

Your vote may hold the key
It's up to you, tell us true
Who'll be, herb of the day?

And your fake, you break, when suckers choose, they lose
I'm like lethal, to you and your people
It's like an outrage, when punks step on stage
With the weak show, weak flow, and still make dough
So I'ma take dough from em, and then stum em
Teach 'em how to really get biz like this
Me and my Gang's gonna swarm... Brainstorm
""Get on it"" --> DJ Premier flips it again

It takes at least, two to tango, so you can get strangled
From any angle, as I get buck on ducks
All the, sexy girlies wanna push up close to
The man with the most who don't flaunt his ego
Some motherfuckers ain't as gifted
Not everyone can move the crowd and uplift it
I'm swift with the shit like a bullet's trajectory
So don't stand next to me
It's like a, warm sensation when my shells hit
You were wrong, you know what you did so you fell quick
To the pavement, no signs of body movement
See I knew it, yo I had to do it
And it's, cool to duel but don't slip up fool
'Cause I'ma leave you dead and stinkin like a sesspool
And all the chicks know what's goin' on
Cause baby, there ain't no sunshine when I'm gone
And you can beg for me to stay and parlay
But sorry, I gots to go, got bills to pay
See by nature I'm godly
When I touch the mic, it's never too hard for me
To let out, a mastermind of mad clout
Huh, me and my Gang's gonna swarm... Brainstorm
""Get on it"" --> DJ Premier displays turntablism skills
(Guru)
I'm gonna get ya
You might be bigger than me, so I'ma wet ya
Come into your house to douse it with the
Malatov cocktail, I won't fail
Burn out your eyeballs, and leave a note in braille
So what the fuck you gonna do?
Yeah I know I used to act relaxed but now I'm cuckoo
Come into my darkest deepest thoughts
We fought I won, and now you're caught and bein tortured
Water pellets dripped upon your forehead
But you can't move, because you're tied up
Your time's up..."

I advise you to tell us where the cash is
Itchy fingers cause nothing but gun fire
We disallow all these cats in the camp
We the champs, not really to boast and brag
Bustin' heads, body bags and toe tags
Black mags to blow your whole chest in half
If you don't know the equation then you can't do the math
I know you cram to understand the plan, but you too
Caught up in the rapture, front and we will capture
See men and strap ya, cock back and blast ya
Blow up your fuckin' house while we still lookin' at ya

You ain't livin' right punk, I'll have to school you
Not rule you, but I'll say yo you fool yourself
When you try to deny and defy written laws
This means your cause has lost
Think about it, take the time, and even ponder longer
Then let your mind start to wander
Go black and track the facts, about all of your mistakes
It only takes to one to make fate
Pick up your life, clean up your act, and get a legal plan
You can, or be an evil man
Caught, and then you claim you're not responsible
The choice was yours, when the fun's gone you will realize
That you don't get somethin' for nothin', why you bluffin?
Others even brothers are stuffin their pockets
With honest cash, they'll laugh, so don't knock it
Jock it, cause the Guru must stop it
I'll jab you, smack you, crack -- you're demolished
You must acknowledge -- life is like a college in itself
Get a degree in reality
Or you will be upon it like a lawn you'll be walked on
Gone, never to see or be the same again
Friend, cause the time you spend
Bringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace
Bringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race
Will have your life in a wreck
And homeboy life is cause and effect
* Primo scratches *
(Guru)
Exactly what you put in boy, you will get out of it
The energy released comes back, there is no doubt of it
So when you thrive to connive and contrive foolish deeds
This means you'll bleed from greed
Dig the rhyme dig the thought, of what'll happen
You're nappin, you're gonna fall off the map 'n'
Lie out, and cry out, why? You got the short end of the stick
'Cause you're too quick to run tricks
Open your mind, widen your sight, get out of your rut
MOVE, and get the lead out of your butt
Cause you can't live without a plan to get freshed chump
And you shouldn't stand to let
Anything sway you from the path you know is truthful
Chill, cause you know the chosen youth will
Take over, and control the whole so don't blow it
Know it, cause the Guru must show it
I'll teach you, reachin' each so you're enlightened
Emcees are frightened, by what I write in my songs
'Cause I express what I manifest
While some of you fall down to the ground with breakdowns
Never to see or be the same again
Friend, cause the time you spend
Bringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace
Bringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race
Will have your life in a wreck
And homeboy life is cause and effect
* Primo scratches *
(Guru)
You're still playin' games lame, I'll have to end you
Straight to the gate of fate, so you can claim your doom
Will you decay as you pay in repentance
I light my sentence like incense
Breathe in, expel your fears as you marvel
Heed what I feed, you won't starve you'll make it
But if you don't, you will be finished
You'll disappear, you will diminish
Never to see or be the same again
Friend, cause the time you spend
Bringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace
Bringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race
Will leave you bugged and upset
Cause homeboy life is cause and effect
Cause and effect!
* Primo scratches *

You puny protozoa, you're so minute you didn't know the
Gang has been watchin but instead of just squashin you
I'm scoopin you up out of the muck you wallow in
Like a chief chemist, other scientists are followin
Plannin to examine you, on a petrie dish
Sticking you and frickin you, just a teenie bit
I'm clever, with science, but never relyin
On false words from cowards who forever be tryin'
Insistin they come off, I let 'em get some off
Then come back wit drum tracks, their ears could get numb off
Blockbustin, like makin' love, I'll never stop thrustin
Into your system, so just listen
I'm like a neurosurgeon, operatin wit a purer version
I write prescriptions, of words that fit in
The thought gets prescribed, as I kick it live
'Cause it's more that a style, it's conceptual genius
My effect on the scene is, to project that I mean this
You deadbeat, wait until you see my next feat
I get respect for the rep when I speak

I'm rushin you like a defensive end as I recommend
That you comprehend, I could stomp you in
A battle, contest, or war, what will occur
Will be the forfeiture, of your immature
Insecure for sure, meek, weak visions of grandeur
To rudely awaken you, and then'll be breakin you
Taxin without askin and trackin and snakin you
Makin' you succumb to the drums of GangStarr

You'll be dyin', tryin' to face the fate of your delusions
Cause miscalculation, is all you're statin
So I'm chumpin, puntin punks just like footballs

To clean up the slop, and stop all the bullcrap

(Guru)
I hit the chicks with the nice round heinies
Play a hoe like a hoe, play a sucka like stymied
Try me, and you'll descend into your end
Never thought it could be you well think again my friend
My pen illuminates, and dooms the fakes
You're soon to break, you're strawberry like shortcake
I'm in that ass with my Timbs all day
You couldn't tarnish my rep, so you crept away
Just behave and be a good son -- or else
I'm bringin' the noise cause most emcees are puns
I used to chill in Roxbury now I'm comin' outta Brooklyn
Herb niggaz are assed out, y'all get tooken
Or taken, and that's word to all rude bwoy Jamaican
I swing bitch, yes I'm crankin
Just like an Alpine, a deadly rhyme, brand spankin new
Pumped to put some lead in your crew
A hollow point shot, cause your weak shallow point's
Not hittin -- should've gave up from the beginning
But since you're bluffin with your tape that's trash
Tell your peeps that we comin' for datazz
""Here we come, here we come, here we kiddy-come-come"" --> Run-D.M.C.
Whose that lurkin in the dark with the hoodie strapped;
Puffin on a blizz, mellow meditatin black?
I ain't impressed cause the rest they fess
Sometimes I wanna flip, clap a hole in they chest
But I lay back, as I prepare for the payback
And drop the master rhymes with the mad crew from wayback
I stay back, I watch, the whole job, you botched
Couldn't maintain, it's like your brain just stopped
But the Gang is on the prowl kid like Lector
Paint a logo with your blood so you niggaz remember
The Chain and the Star, mysticle and never typical
The average rap group, ain't even equipped to go
Head up, I'm dead up, you ducks could never last
You fakin jacks, we comin' for datazz
""Here we come, here we come, here we kiddy-come-come"" --> Run-D.M.C.
I heard some hardheaded punks wanna see me
Jealous of a nigga just because he's on TV
You know the video shows that you be watchin
Call up and request so you can see it more often
My persona sheds more light than a nova
Cause niggaz are soldier, yo this war, it ain't over
And ain't no stopping like McFadden and Whitehead
You might get dead, fuckin' around like you do
Pursue the knowledge that's available
Before your chump-style game and your punk friends fail you
Gonna dissect your brain for a minute
Look at your puny ass world and what's in it
Nothin', that's how long you've been frontin
I figured by now that you've come up with somethin'
But you're still the same snake with my name on your mouth
Wanna know what I'm doin', wanna know why I shine?
'Cause I'm the rebirth, so now you gotta see me first
I kick more facts than paperbacks for research
And knees hurt, next you feel 'em bucklin
The huge pussy look on your face reveals the sucker
Inside of ya, because I checked the way you're ridin' the
Jimsome, better sing more than a hymn son
Never sustain the true pain of my wisdom
Never be able to touch GangStarr
True indeed, I believe in takin' my words far
Across the seas and deserts, through the trees and grass
And if you ain't on point, then we comin' for datazz

27,Conspiracy,1992,Daily Operation (1992),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"You can't tell me life was meant to be like this
A black man in a world dominated by whiteness
Ever since the declaration of independence
We've been easily brainwashed by just one sentence
It goes: all men are created equal
That's why corrupt governments kill innocent people
With chemical warfare they created crack and AIDS
Got the public thinking these were things that black folks made
And every time there's violence shown in the media
Usually it's a black thing so where are they leading ya
To a world full of ignorance, hatred, and prejudice
TV and the news for years they have fed you this
Foolish notion that blacks are all criminals
Violent, low lifes, and then even animals
I'm telling the truth so some suckers are fearing me
But I must do my part to combat the conspiracy
The S.A.T. is not geared for the lower class
So why waste time even trying to pass
The educational system presumes you to fail
The next place is the corner then after that jail
You've got to understand that this has all been conspired
To put a strain on our brains so that the strong grow tired
It even exists when you go to your church
'Cause up on the wall a white Jesus lurks
They use your subconscious to control your will
They've done it for a while and developed the skill
To make you want to kill your own brother man
Black against black you see it's part of their plan
They want to send us to war and they want to ban rap
What they really want to do is get rid of us blacks
Genocide is for real and I hope that you're hearing me
You must be aware to combat the conspiracy
Even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold
Now that rap is big business the snakes got bold
They give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop
'Cause they have no regard for real hip-hop
They'll compare you to others and say: ""but yo, he sells""
And you know in your heart that he's weak as hell
So you say: ""I ain't doing that corny stuff""
But they tell ya that your chart positions will go up
Sometimes they front big time and make you many promises
And when they break 'em then your mama says
""Son you're making records but that guy seems shady""
It could be too late and your career could be played gee
I hope you listen to the things that I'm sharing see
We all have a job to combat the conspiracy"

I'm heated up, 'cause I'm seein folks that are so phony
They didn't know me when I was broke and I was lonely
Only a few came to check me, so they come first...
... And yo our people come next G
We'd go to a club, the Milky Way or the Payday
The outlaw spots, where the music was real hot
And you wasn't there, when the underrated, real MC's
Came equipped... and used to kick slick lyrics
All live, without no lipsync
To a dope crate, building skills from instinct
I'm tired of people, gettin' all excited
I'm not trippin' on just a thing, but I'm delighted
To let you know, that some others be flim-flammin
I'll let you know, that all this time, we been jammin
So give up the props Hobbes, jealousy's a flaw
If the next man deserves it, earns it, it should be law

Cause their record companies don't really market them right
Most of the people signin acts, they ain't from the street
Cause yo they come from the sweet...
... Soft section of town
While they be sweatin and pretendin that they know a real rap sound
But I know some guys, and some ladies, that can fill those spots mate
To promote the real greats
And educate, and get it straight
And mobilizin the imitators, exposin the explosive core
I hope to explore
Galaxies of remedies for your wack rap sickness
As I convey relay, mack rap quickness
In this business, I witness trickyness
Some MC's are into stickyness
But I'm sayin' this, from experience, I'm furious
I didn't get this far overnight, and there's nothin' like

The chances of the wack takin' all the dollars
Support the brothers who are truly gifted
This way, the odds, could never be shifted
Like my man, you know he works real hard
He's good at what he does and now he lives real large
So why envy him, or anyone in his crew
Just sit back and give the credit y'all where it is due
Give the credit... where it's due
Give the credit y'all... where it is due
Give the credit... where it's due
Just give the credit y'all... where it is due

Crazy as I wanna be
'Cause I make it orderly

The brotha dat will make you change opinions
Dominions I'm in them when it's time to kick shit from
The heart, plus I get a piece of the action
I'm feelin' satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid, too late
When they dip in the kick they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink and in still is
I get more props den stunts den Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes and can't lose when I cruise
Out on the expressway
Leavin' the Bodega I say ""suave""

Now may I make a mark
Then make a spark over this phat track

But they lack the new knack that's comin' from way way back
Hey yo Premier, please pass that buddha sack
You hear we quit?
No way, bullshit

Do me a favor, don't try and catch me
Slightly ahead of the game, I'm not a lame
Ask him, he'll tell you the same he knows my name

Yeah, bout to talk about some serious shit
Deadly habits, you know everybody's got 'em
Just that some niggaz try to front, try to cover shit up
But fuck that, I be wylin sometimes - you know why?
Cause suckers be thinkin' that shit is sweet
Niggaz be thinkin' that rap niggaz ain't real, haha
Yeah well that's aight, that's aight
Let 'em think what they want
(Verse One: Guru)
Yo I'm steady at it, them deadly habits
I pray for the best outcome son, but my dome's already shattered
By the shit that's occurred
Drivin' home tipsy from the club, puffin herb, vision blurred
Thinkin' 'bout them niggaz who caught the drop
Who I gotta stop, who he caught, and who still gotta get popped
Stash box, feelin' like Fish in ""King of New York""
Wifey do her thing for the God, she don't be bringin' me pork
Cause there's enough deadly shit a brother be facin
Up in V.I.P., niggaz drinks they be lacin
Got a nigga sweatin pacin', not ready to fall the fuck up
But ready to pull out, and back 'em all the fuck out
And my guardian angel, is always there to protect
And my supreme nature, keeps all them savages in check
How the hell did everything get so twisted
They say be careful what you pray for, so I guess now it's this shit
(Chorus: Guru)
They will never know - what I do to get by
And them many times I almost died
They will never know - all the reasons why I flip
And now I gotta keep an extra clip
They will never know - what this stress is like
And why I'm on point, ready to fight
They will never know - all the pressure and pain
Don't give a fuck if they think less of me mayne
(Verse Two: Guru)
Deadly habits, they could be a number of things
Everybody got 'em, some people do ugly things
Excessive behaviour, it can get the best of you
Trust me, I'm a lot like the rest of you
I got issues, that haven't been resolved
You know like, money people owe me while they out havin' a ball
(Mmm) Guess they too got deadly habits
Got me on a mission, to go and merk, each and every faggot
Manager's coked up, A&R's all doped up
Old school style, have 'em gagged up and roped up
Those deadly habits have me losin my cool
But yo the Son can't chill, so I'ma be abusin them fools
Pull the plug on 'em, pull the rug on 'em
Have 'em callin up, all their closest thug friends
Them niggaz can get it too
This GangStarr shit is too deep, to even get into
So fuck you!
(Verse Three: Guru)
Fuck you wanna do, we way past 7:30
Be easy, too many brothers seem to go to heaven early
It's hell in these streets, but soon I'm on a hot streak
Who's in the hot seat, who had a felony beef
Yo I beat cases, with different attorneys
And I laughed at the racist DA's, who were wishin to burn me
My mom caught a heart attack, around the same time
News articles were published, around the same time
This depressed me more, but I stayed in tact
And that last corny chick I was with, she got played in fact
I know niggaz that did dumb time, and dumb crimes
I fuck with real niggaz, and never cowards with dumb minds
This country's got us in a fix
America, your deadly habits, got us all up in the mix
War without, war within, holy war, mortal sin
Tell me - huh, what's the origin?"

Yo, just because I want to, it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry, it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good, it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rapping, don't mean I chase ass
Just because I'm whylin, don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby and I use it a lot
People here's something that you should be considerin
Things could turn bitter when, you don't use discipline
You might wake up the next day upset and in fear
Buggin out, yapping bout, ""How the fuck did I get here?
Who the hell is this stranger, starin' all in my face?""
Now you wish you hadn't positioned yourself in that place
Think just in case you should took more precaution
A good time can become a nightmare so often
Like this nigga I know, that met these chicks on tour
They rocked him to sleep, robbed his ass for cash galore
Skated off in the night, without a trace or a hint
Scheamin tantalizin him, dressed up in lace and shit
Caught that kid out there, all high and dumbfounded
Made him think he was gettin' some pussy
He just knew he was gonna pound it
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preaching death in my songs, I breathe life
(Total)
Baby won't you take the time (take the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (on your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right (don't make it right)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee...)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby, now let's make it right (on your love..) (I like you..)
(GURU)
Tycoon thug, he made me a ten thousand dollar investment
Now he's not to be messed with, make the girls get undressed quick
He's on some big muscled chest shit, posted by the exit
That's my man, he's the owner, yeah he be on some next shit
Said we'd make a few million by the next millennium
Told me to keep dropping jewels like a triggerman, puttin' lead in him
Like Flavor said, I tell these hoes to kill the noise
You know your pops told you, watch them New York boys
All night, the ladies be like up in my mug
Tranquilin and trance dancin up in my drug
Fly honies, they hold me down like always
The same cat that used to get blunted down in the hallways
I love the cutie pies, never the zootie pies
I got discipline, I want the crew to rise
Situations like this'll make you think twice
Instead on preachin death in my songs, I breathe life
(GURU)
Ladies, here's somethin' that we should be considerin
Things could get bitter when, you don't use discipline
Imaginin yourself livin' lavish and plush
Hangin' with the cat whose spendin cabbage and buyin stuff
However don't be clever with your endeavor
And don't let too many men receive your treasure
Most cats be thinkin' with they bozack
I admit in the past I was tryin' to break these hoes backs
Escape, without givin' up a dime
You know them fly ladies had a good fuckin' time
Coppin me some Timberland with a jacket to match it
Girls nowadays wanna pigeon for chicken scratch
And I ain't givin' up nathan
Long as my game expands, it's my discipline to hate 'em
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death, I breathe life
And just because I want to, it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry, it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good, it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rapping, don't mean I chase ass
And just because I'm whylin, don't mean I can't stop

One more false move, I'll grab my toast and I'll bust ya
And you, stop talking shit and pass the L
Got mad clientel, real niggas know me well
Other rappers go on tour and stay in their hotels
Me and my boys, we're as true as they come, son
We come from some ill life experience and take rap serious
I'm curious about the fakers and the frauds
About the silly-ass broad and about all the bullshit going on
So when I step into the club I come hardcore
Rip the mic to shreds plus skunk before encore
And after that I just max (max)
Like Max Julien I'm the authentic Mack
So just relax, and keep the cuts like a lance
We gots no worries, we get the dough in advance
Got to get the dough, got to run the show (Repeat 4x)
Watch me, I got the bitch chumps on the spot, G
And when I rock these fly honeys want to jock me
So copy this one son, you fucking biter
Shut the hell up, you're damn right I don't like ya
I'll spit on your style, shit on your crew with a smile
Fucks no, you ain't wild, we've been in your file
You fantasy ruffneck, go bluff with your tec
But you'd better show respect or blood will drip like sweat
Check yourself because now there's doo doo in your pants
I enhance the dance and get the loot in advance
Got to get the dough, got to run the show (Repeat 4x)
""Doe in Advance"" is the name of this tune
You know what's up hops, GangStarr's in the room
Soon you'll feel the boom of masterpiece from the East
Nuff respect to where you're from, just don't act dumb
We drop the shit that's classic, you can't surpass it
We lasted, and now we run shit, you bastard
I'm like an ambush, moving on you quick
Got more depth than shallow rappers cause my game is thick
A thousand MC's in a week I subtract
Cause the market's oversaturated with scrub acts
Who wants to try next, and who wants to die next?
I'm vexed with motherfuckers, whose dome should I fly next?
Up from the alley, now the riches I acquire
Cats are coming by the wire, rhymes are chariots of fire
Call me the don, call me the man, or call me sir
But never forget this nigga knows the score
For cometition, yo there's no fucking chance
My troop is popping through clocking dough in advance

The emotions that one goes thourgh, over a loss of a loved one
Or friend then, knowing the cost of rebuilding and carrying on
It gets so damn hard in this modern day Babylon
And disease runs rampant, so many men carry arm
So many have a lonely painful road to travel on
Mothers losing sons, improper use of guns
Children go astray because their parents were abusive ones
I used to run with the illest guys
Thourgh the realest eyes
I seen the realest and the illest die
The cycle continues, so many times the good ones
The young ones
So many misunderstood ones
Remembering their faces and voices
And when the wise man said
Life is full of choices
Some get caught up, others are innocent victims
All I know is they were close to us, and that we miss them

You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker,
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me to drop her for it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelects
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my beema goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Bow I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I'm still gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field 'cause I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with a grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl 'cause I'm on with the next girl
Next
<'Cause girls look so good>
Verse Two
She had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near 'cause of my svoir faire
The time we shared was brief 'cause I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She wines and she pouts about how I did her bad
Yo but she'd tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec 'cause the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl 'cause I'm straight with the next girl
Verse Three
You saw my mom in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked how's my sister then asked how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father 'cause you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darlin' was fly and this was the problem
'Cause back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and me I just bugged
Caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex-girl to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
Went home to see mom and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? nah I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl & I'm out with the next girl
Out..."

You asked how's my sister then asked how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father 'cause you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darlin' was fly and this was the problem
'Cause back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and me I just bugged
Caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex-girl to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
Went home to see mom and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? nah I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl & I'm out with the next girl
Out..."
39,Ex-Girl To The Next Girl,2006,Mass Appeal: Best Of Gang Starr (2006),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Verse One
You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker,
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me to drop her for it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelects
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my beema goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Bow I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I'm still gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field 'cause I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with a grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl 'cause I'm on with the next girl
Next
<'Cause girls look so good>
Verse Two
She had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near 'cause of my svoir faire
The time we shared was brief 'cause I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She wines and she pouts about how I did her bad
Yo but she'd tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec 'cause the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl 'cause I'm straight with the next girl
Verse Three
You saw my mom in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked how's my sister then asked how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father 'cause you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he'd really get hyper

He was my right hand man, but he betrayed me
I let him chill at my crib, 'cause we were down and
I went to work everyday while he was loungin
He tried to backstab, he kept on jokin
He didn't know he could've got his back broken
I had to cut homeboy off for even tryin' that
His game was mad weak, know what I'm sayin' black?
Stepped to him quietly, he copped a plea
Told him to fix it or I'd have to catch a body
In this society, there's many snakes
Don't be too eager when you're seeking a break
Cause chumps will exploit, use you to benefit
So just be keen and, learn all the ins of it
I've had my share, of dealing with fake men
I left them squealing, ""It was I who did the taking""
Proceeding exactly, according to plan
I foiled the scheme cause it seemed I was that man
And if you step up like the kid who did front
You will bear witness... the execution of a chump
Now, now... let's get the purpose of it
I'm snatchin hearts out of chumps, 'cause I deserve to love it
Observin acts of a snake, while I evaluate
Eliminate the nucleus, I'm doin' this
Pissed usin' fists usin' force of any sort
My conscience says it's nonsense, if I put up with it
It meaning sleazy, sorry-type slick types
I'll drive 'em all to danger, and make 'em hitchike
'Cause if you step up like the kid who did front
You will bear witness... the execution of a chump
Call me the Guru... known as a spiritual teacher
I'll reach you deftly, directly, correctly so select me
Elect me as your prophet and we'll praise him as I drop it
Pursue this, review this, I knowledge more than buddhist monks, punk
I'll wreck the set and grab a big chunk
Known to be a wise one, known to be a seeker
Following my calling in life, so I can keep the
Minds in line to find devine designs of rhyme
Rewind this on your box one time
But if you step up like the kid who did front
You will bear witness... the execution of a chump"

42,Flip The Script,1992,Daily Operation (1992),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Brave is the knave who steps up to be slayed
By the one who forgave him for his first mistakes
He'd best behave, or I'ma send him a wave
Of some shocking volts, he doesn't know what he's talkin' about
He's kickin a bunch of crap so I'll be the judge of that
The boy lacks artistry but still he tries hard to be
An entertainer, but instead he's a waste of
My time and your time so I'll kick the pure rhymes
Whenever you're looking for rap that's exceptional
And credible, straight to the G's you better go
Cause GangStarr's known to be prone to be
Masters of streetwise poetry and turntable wizardry
But still be a cold day in Hell when you hear that
Guru or Premier ever tell suckers get sales
But they fail in the long run that kid who went gold yo
That was the wrong one but tonight the spotlight is all on me
I'm the Guru, of the G-A-N-G
Taking out scrubs 'cause they rub me the wrong way
And I'll say, that they've still got a long way to go
To show they can flow like a real pro
So gimme that loot catch the boot from my steel toe
I'm changing the scenery as I make 'em uncomfortable
Cause most MC's ain't really got no pull
Watch me stifle 'em quick with the gift and the wit
Make 'em quit all that riff as I flip the script
Fool listen, I know that you've been missing
All this and so my rhymes are gonna gleem and glisten
Like a gem, and if you are the fake MC type
I'll shine so bright I'll be blinding your eyesight
Your capabilities fall short so I'ma treat you like a dwarf
On a basketball court still you try to rap
And even claim you got new styles but
Rolling your tongue's been playe dout for a while
And you don't sound fly so why are you doing that?
You had a dope track but you're wack so you ruined that
I couldn't make out what you were saying your diction
Is jumbled where as me I'm conveying clear thoughts
To a crowd that's most critical
Booty duck rappers like you are just pitiful
I bet you couldn't name more than one pioneer
Cause you didn't pay dues and you got on on outta nowhere
But that's OK 'cause I'm peeping your card
If rap was my house you'd be sweeping the yard
As I recline I'll find more chores to give ya
Like moppin the floors or maybe fetchin my slippers
So don't even trip or run off with the lip
Cause as soon as you slip you know I'll flip the script
So as I kick a bit flip with script without a skip
Butter roll MC's get dissed like this
You'll never got none son because I'll become troublesome
You rap like a simpleton
And I hate scum yo I can easily deflect your threats
'Cause they're idle my recital will break you down
Just a fight till the end 'cause I can take ten at a time
Give 'em all a fair shot to see if any can rhyme
And even if one is decent, I'll still get props
I'll kick the slick lines till the last one drops
As my powerful skills are unveiled I'm tippin the scales
And weighing much more than your tall tales
Stop the exaggeration perpetration observe
And make simple notation
Nobody no where no way no how
Is taking me out 'cause I can throw so you know now
Can you feel it, I bust raps so lay off
Before I steal that so called title that you gave yourself
But you really ain't jack so yo you played yourself
And now you look from a distance as you sweat my tip
You know I'll whip you swift when I flip the script"

Tell me, do you have a clue of what to do
Can you groove to this smooth tune, you must presume
It's important, for you to follow this creation
And hey Son, life is more than having fun
So run and get some help with the problems that you face
Take a taste of the bass put your perspective in place
Get real, deep, so you can keep involved
Revolve and solve, so you can make the calls
Like a supervisor he who is wiser than the others
'Cause they need someone to advise them to discover
Things that they don't know so the papers I will check
Then they'll start to grow to this form of intellect
(DJ Premier cuts ""individual with intellect"" --> unknown)
(Guru)
When the road is too steep, do you have the stamina
First album took us two weeks, since then we have been plannin
An exclusive attraction, produce it to your satisfaction
Those of you lackin, we will put you back in your slime
So you can think and get a grip of
Yourself by yourself, and then you'll get a sip of
A gift that's equipped with the script that shocks
You can take a walk ?on God?
With your mouth wide open, hoping you can find a
Way to display similar actions in a kind of mockery
Cause you don't realize the cost to be
Creative genius please, I'm too clean to play
Glance per chance, watch GangStarr perfect
And dance your pants like champs, to this form of intellect
(DJ Premier cuts ""Man with intellect"" --> Lord Finesse)
Valuable solutions, we invent here
Break and remake the cupcakes to show we've been sent here
To serve you, so swallow this and bite it
And why bring, ignorance when we're inviting
You to get advancement, while you're on the dance tip
And don't you know the transcript will make you shake hips
Or chill at will, and with skill, you'll learn some etiquette
Better get the subject or be last at the predicate
And get a set, of headphones and speakers
As lyrical lessons manifest, I will keep you
Abrest of the best, in this rap mess
Oversaturated market, full of wackness
I'm Gifted Unlimited, Rhymes Universal
The GURU, nursing you with a verse spilled
Don't choke, and don't turn blue in a frenzy
Premier's severe, on the steel wheels he lends me
Spontaneous cuts, but not mainly just that
It's the scratching format, exact with maddening accuracy
Craftily, on the side or in back of me
Nastily, as if his name was Dick Dastardly
Original so get it yo the Gang gets respect
The chain and the star is a symbol, of this form of intellect

I campaign to gain my domain
And vocalizing techniques, emcees are deadbeats
And drop to the ground then, I stomp 'em down with sound
I'm a pacifist, but they won't last with this
Dope beat combined with lyrical energy
You can rewind this, play this again and see
Just how I kick the, rhymes that hit ya
Snug in your mug, while I depict a

If you're loungin, I'll take the mic and
Show you how it goes in, I'll leave you frozen

Give a speech to you while I impeach the

Take it from me, then you will see, I got the G

Don't seem to understand that I'm just that bad
Too gold, too bold, too fly for them to stop
The man to respect 'cause I'm ripping up blocks
I gotta get the dough, gotta run the show
I'm flipping like a kilo, stash a million or so
Go for what you feel and deal wit this
'Cause I'm dangerous, I come real wit this
And packing and strapping, it goes along wit the rapping
By any means necessary, you can't get buried
I may come wit a smile but I've been known to get crazy wild

And I've been out here and yes, I've seen you
I know your face, I know your name and all your people kid
I've got mad connections, so won't do a bid
I make the moves, I'm never faking

Mad murderer stalk in the night when you walk
Feelings of stone to the bone, I'm a rock
No regrets for doing shit I had to do
I was hard headed and yeah, I still am too
But you know I got things under control
So you should slow your roll that's my advice to you bro
A street veteran, sometimes I'm trife as a juvenile
I'll beep your style, you can't fuck wit the golden child
That's why you're riffing but you know you're just ass kissing
You wanna meet'cha maker, I'm a take ya

Then try your game, lamb, and end up taking a big loss
If I don't get my way, you're history

I came to get what's due to me 'cause I got clout
I make the moves, I'm never faking

I'm sinister, I'm selling no wolf tickets here
Rolling correct to get my point across clear
Sights in the city make me bitter
And I ain't taking no shit from no sucker nigga
I move swift, always looking for the money to make
I need the cash flow, I got a lot at stake
And I could never go out like a crab
So shut the hell up and put the money in a big bag
Hand it over smooth like
I need fat dough, I got things to do tonight
I'm always on my job, ain't no time to be caught short
And those outta line, pay a fine or get knocked off
It's my turn to clock the duckets
Being broke, nah, I can't fuck wit it
I'm making moves, never faking

So I can show you how it's gotta be done
I never run or shun, I've just begun
I've got gusto
""My man gots that gusto"" ""Word""
(Repeat 2X)

""My man gots that gusto"" ""Word""

Ah yeah... gusto..."
48,Hardcore Composer,1992,Daily Operation (1992),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Now I got you looking stiff you numbskull, you're at a stand still
Still faking that you're hard with your rhymes and got no hand skills
So I'll easily drop you and stop you from rhyming
Send you home to moms all bruised up and crying
Then if you want you can go call your people
You're gonna need a mob against me 'cause I'm lethal
Not that I'm a violent brother to the contrary
My vocals carry, and then I bury
MC's in holes that they dug for themselves
Couldn't be themselves so they sold themselves
To a company exec who doesn't have respect
For real rap music so he wants to get an MC
That starts out street to crossover
But not me, 'cause I'm the hardcore composer
You ain't a writer nor a fighter you're just a biter
I think you need to save all that because in spite
Of the reputation that you think you have
The crew already knows that you're really a crab
So I'll grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
And back to trace my flow but don't waste your time bro
It only takes a minute a second for me to switch
And rearrange real quick 'cause I can kick plenty styles
Rhymes stretch many miles
I'm the authentic yes the lyric unloader
The truth exposer, the hardcore composer
All you delirious curious suckers
You better act like you've been known I mack
And hold my own with a mike just to stagger
A bragger, retire a lair and very easily
I'm pass by ya cause you didn't want to give the credit
Where it was due, yeah it was you, uh huh it was you
And your crummy corny ass crew
So we shall enforce that you lost and plus you oughta
Find another type of life and yes another source of income
And here's some advice you can't rap this nice
I broke ya over and over I told ya
I would mold ya why? Because I'm bound
To give original sound and as your ears pound
Bringing pleasure and pain
As brains start to gain from musical measures
Forming mystical questions never typical inventions
Developed by my Gifted Unlimited mind
Suckers wanna rhyme 'cause they're eager to find
The secret behind the way that I stomp all comp
Just like a Timberland it's the Guru and Premier
It's them again droppin' the fly tracks
And taking things over and never selling out
'Cause I'm the hardcore composer"
49,"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow",1991,Step In The Arena (1991),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Many MC's are mislead
Mislead by the lies that they pump in their heads
The money and the fame that they're hoping to find
Will never come close to the scope of my rhyme
Now some have been successful but really
And yo, these MC's are clearly not nearly
Up to this level or should I say caliber
Because I'm hype that the company's selling me
Because they'll take a dud, talk some crud and then push him
But in the next year, someone new will just squoosh him
Because when you sell out to appeal to the masses
You have to go back and enroll in some classes
So cash in your check 'cause it's the last one you get
The tables have turn and now you ain't in effect
So jet to the rear and you better just follow
'Cause what's here today maybe gone tomorrow
Here and gone in a flash, some made cash
While other suckers go broke real fast
Some never make any money but still they act funny
LIke they're thinking they're running
Things, wearing rings and medallions
Then listen to their rhymes when we rather take valiums
'Cause swiftness and skills they are lacking
So I send them packing, they should have know not to tax in
And smashing all of the vocals to smithereens
Watching them collecting themselves 'cause they ?(bitter seen)?
But some find happiness while others find sorrow
And what's here today, maybe gone tomorrow"
50,Here's The Proof,1989,No More Mr. Nice Guy (1989),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"All right buddy, when can I make you study?
I'll take you out while I talk about some ugly
Things taking place, within the rap race
I'm well aware it's Premier, I got a taste
Of the bitterness, 'cause I'm the Guru I'm not with the rest of
Those who rose by scandalous means
I'll intervene and you can't handle the scene
'Cause you're bugged, by all the drugs and payola
The gameplan, I will smartly take over
I'm bolder, I'm wiser, I got the eyes to
Observe all the MC's perping a move
And after the circus, I'm certain to prove
That a man, traveling with wisdom book in hand
Will stand, longer than any king of merely one land
And after the war is sort and peace
The Gang will be the dealers of the dope beats
Always, in hallways we're lurking
Working, like an army of surgeons
To cut up your butt up, so what up you can't team
Shake and don't mistake, the mystical chance and
Glance, at the brothers with the stunned look
And at the stake is where we're gonna burn crooks
When though they bite but can't fight the mighties
Prepare your head for flight, say ""Goodnighty""
Most likely, I be saying the truth
Cause GangStarr means ""funky"" and here is the proof
*DJ Premier scratched the chorus*
A lotta brothers, you know they wanna act like
They're tight, a brother's like the wack type
Who underrate the record but check it a second
If the G the you the R the you is somebody new
We'll never lie to you
I wouldn't try to do what I would die to do
I'm not despising you, but use your eyes just to see
Envision how it'll be
Cause now it'll be me, on a rhyme spree
Going far, large, wide, so let us take a ride
Inside, of transcendentalism
I'm on a mission, you're in a mental prison
Getting nuff respect and more selective and effective
So respect this, I insist you be swift and catch the movement
As I shoo the tenderonies, don't be phony
Take some time to spend to know me
'Cause I'm complex, decking MC's while I quiz them
The real deal I reveal so feel the wisdom
And strength, 'cause I can go the whole length
Just like a preacher preaching the truth
GangStarr means ""funky"" and here is the proof
*DJ Premier in deep concentration once again*
This beat is thumping, and I'm a keep you jumping
I'll pull your card, I'm hitting harder put the chumps
In a daze, like a maze they can't get out of
And as they try they can't deny I got the clout of
The Bossman, and in a battle you'll be tossed and
Turned, to learn more gracious ways
You must behave, or I'm a take this phrase like an icepick
And I might pick you off
You're soft, let's see how quick you frost
In a meat freezer, we'll seize you then sqeeze ya
Head to get rid of the lies you believe
And after this process your eyes will receive
The glowing light, brighter than any ever in your sight
So hype, that you will gain the sense to wanna act right
In spite, of all your faults before
The Gang, will be the ones to make you seek your
Knowledge, it all is a blessing
Addressing, things about which you're guessing
So hear it, get near it, compare it to others
Think and take a drink, I'm a lyrical brother
I'd love ya, to be all you can be
If you're a man, you should be manly
Not sissy-like, and not so deceitful
Because the Gang may hang you or keep you
As prisoners, for not believing the truth
That GangStarr means funky, and here is the proof
*DJ Premier flexes his oft-copied turntable skills*"

Same Team, No Games""
(Feat. H. Staxx, NYG'z)
(NYG'z)
Yo, do the knowledge to the master build the blow and the spliff
The new millennium, hide them a beef
Gotta watch what I say to you niggaz so I calm my patience
'Cause the shit ain't really pass the statue of limitations
The streets still holler about how strong I am
Niggaz I hurt still holler about how wrong I am
As a little nigger broke, thinking soda and coke
Had me amazed how my steady hand kept in the flow
Let it sit, cool and heart lit, hit the set cool and heartless
In front of the store projects, as long as I made a profit
I see you eyeing me, you fire escape diary
Filled with pages of episodes and shying me
Nonbeliever I hammer for hire
Hit yo ass so hard that your coke will catch fire
Dog the stakes are dyer, I'm no liar
Hold the court and the street beef 'cause I got pride
(H. Staxx)
Same team no games, these chicks I blow brains
Rap-a-lot soul train the corners rocking cocaine
Got no shame
Trying to blow these figures
Headquarters gone he ain't left he still with us
Not in the physical through us he live
I can seen him with Big L, Pun, Pac and BIG
Watching over the kid like dear shed the waist over
And yelling ""Ether"", ""Blowout"" and ""Takeover""
I'm the truth; give you proof and your video shoot
Pull them candors on you while them cameras on you
How you love that
Don't want to blow with Staxx
So go ahead dumb up, make me car crumb up
""It's the Militia""
Y'all niggaz don't know about I
Got me heated, frustrated about to blow my high
Me and Benz blazing, Rave got the gauge raising
Sick of talking about it, niggaz ain't on my weight lift
(NYG'z)
Whenever we stand together, down for whatever
Divided we get at you from more angles
Gangstarr forbid, NYG's same team no games
Love is love fame one in the same
Corny style, niggers act strange going against the grain
Don't want to see us on top of our thing, we adapt to change
Fame, fortune and material game, flow natural unrestrained
Let me explain, niggers don't get it until you set it to flame
Subject them to pain, make them respect
The name, the set you rep, connects you get
Stay ready to bang
Steps ahead of competitors that'll test your aim
H. Staxx shoot back splat dang your brain
My foundation bust gats spread there's your brain
Fuck with mine, spat not take the blame
Play it for keeps, we came to win
(Guru)
YO, I'm the Jerry Rice to this, much too nice to quit
And just so you know, we never liked you kid
Since you ain't wanna let niggers eat
I'm gonna convene with my team before
We gotta let the trigger speak
'Cause nowadays y'all rappers are carbon
Copies paws are sloppy, still its hard to stop me
Especially when I connect with my man, rep for my fam
We taking back the rest of our land
And we don't really care if they say you are the shit
They playing your hits
We about to make our way in this biz
And let's see if the gimmick last until the next season
In a flash, take your stupid ass out, give me the next reason
Flip for my peoples here, spit for my peoples here
Yeah... time to get rich with my peoples here
Cut of a snake's head, then we break bread
Same team, no games
You underground trying to fake dead
(Scratching by DJ Premier repeats)
Let, let, let the games begin
My dick about killin', never been about game
When there wasn't pussy, there was always my haind
Nine and a half-'ll get you in a dame
Anything less is just a GOD DAMN SHAME!
Check my balls, my shit got blue wrinkles on the face
... For them bitches who had the nerve to put me out they place
In they HINEY
The bitch said, ""Panch stand behind me
And put that monster in my hiney,"" HI-NEY!
I come through your block, with that one-eye whistle
One hand on the whistle
One... one-eyed monster hit you
Make it slick, BITCH, my dick game's OFFICIAL!
Lose your weight and, I don't leave you waitin
The world is earthquakin
My balls got yo' ass shakin - it's hiney jack!
Uh-oh! hiney!

Verse One: Guru
I say people people come on and check it out now
You see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
(What's your name?) call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back?
Slander the name and with-hold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many they'll go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year suckers are going no where
'Cause my strret style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
MC's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aiming on raining on the bitch ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggaz better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm bout to blow the fuck up because I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
Yeah me and the crew think its about that time
But on the DL you know that Gangstarr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My nautica, asking for a hookup
Well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business kid, this ain't no free for all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate
Before I get irate
And I'll kick your can
From here to Japan
With force you can't withstand
'Cause I'm the muthafuckin' man
Break: Guru
Yo right now I got my man Lil' Dap from the Group home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man
Verse Two: Lil' Dap
So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, muthafucka just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip
Lil' Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick
So all you punks hear this
Everytime you riff
The more fame that we get
Muthafuckas act hard
Thinking that they are God
Niggaz just don't understand
Let me be my own man
Did everything on my own
And everyplace wasn't home
Everywhere that I'd rest
I had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind
Brothers doin' mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime
As we're rippin' the lines
Brothers just don't know
How shit got to go
'Cause I was told
To never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto
Dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound
Then I walk with a frown
Another minute
Another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close that's why the Group Home is thick
So every time you riff the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next
B'cause he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said
Yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around
Tryin' to get down
Niggaz just don't understand
I'm the mutha fuckin' man

Yo tell them why you're the man
Verse Three: Jeru the Damaja
I'll tap your jaw

Step to the bedlamite I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore with more
Dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef

Niggaz get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot
Don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before
I tap jaws
Snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars
Vic a style you said was yours
Money grip wanna flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us
When we rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lot's of friends, lot's of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, kreeno so I always get cheers
Troop on like a trooper no tears for fears
I'm a get mines 'cause the crew'll get theirs
Cut you up like Edward Scissorhands

Chorus: guru and hannibal
[Guru] while they devise our demise, we grow wise
[Hann] upset the set up, the element of surprise
[Both] it'z a set up
[Guru] it's time to upset the set up
Verse one: guru
Though they conspire, fake us to make us retire
With the burning desire we make it out of the crossfire
Thoughts are higher, elevating and focused
While the path is narrow, for those like us
Primo beats provoke us to meditate like zen
With the will and the strength, of a million men
While they introspect, where nothing is met
It's been that way for a while so much has come and then went
But I'm confident, a few, are due to redeem
Their respective kingdoms, with an abundance of cream
So if I were to scheme, it would be on a realer dream
Like formin effective teams to filter the smokescreens
You totin in jeans, don't even know the true envy
The man I'm pickin' apart, and plus they both were friends to me
Past trivial pursuits like east and west coast feuds
Come against me on the mic, many and most will lose
Like most dudes, I love this hip-hop, and this rap stuff
But I don't like the shows, where the ignorant act up
While some'll be rippin it, they be in the crowd wildin
Flippin on kids, for the chains and medallions
Or the kid they don't like, from a beef from way back
And decide that's the night, perfect time for payback
It's wack for the group, plus the others who came
To see a fat ass show, instead there's bullets aflame
Verse two: hannibal
Still waters run deep this is leagues in depth
Quiet as kept they slept we crept
Society puts the squeeze on MC's like iron grips of death
From here on in peace and blessings long cherish your breath
Gifted and rhyme you now how we do, stay true
Follow through lay down the law, 'cause it's probable and overdue
All systems overdue, my guns know me
I only hold a few my nigga for only a few hold me
Never forget the ones before me, my momma told me
Sacrifice for the ones behind me leadin the seeds
Blind leads, black on black, crime to me
Inclined to refine my creed I eat thinkin' lead
Conceive to make the beast bleed, enhance thoughts
Like tossed trees 'cross the earth three-fourths
Let my offspring feed all three, corpus delectis cost me
Lost and found on enemy ground, quoted although
They don't know how we get down at sound speed we breed
Mo more confined to blind greed and self destructive deeds
Heed my freedom war cry, of course I'm n.y.
Hug my peeps that died, the loved ones alive
Reinforce and fly high as I lie so shall i
From new I to cali next plateau u.n.i.versal
Unleash the black rain
Show 'em who in control, electro-magnetic
Pull on the hole, ill as toters bang out
Till we sittin' on swole the strongest way to grow
The only way I know, underground railroad on track
No physical or mental chain can shackle that

Came across the oceans in chains and shame
Easing the pain, and it was without name
Until some men in New Orleans on Rampart Street
Put out the sounds, and then they gave it a beat
I'm talkin' bout Jelly Roll, King, and Satch
I'm talkin' 'bout the music that had no match
Yes the music, and it was born down there
We're gonna use it, so make the horn sound clear
It's jazz music... jazz music
Yo, the music that Pops, and other cats made
It stayed, cause people love when they played
To the North, it took a riverboat shuffle
To the big cities, with lots of hustle and bustle
To Chicago, and to the Apple too
This was a scene, that our forefathers knew
Go get your crew, I know they'll get into
The jazz music... jazz music
The music called jazz had the razzamatazz
It had the flavor, and a lot of pizazz
The big band beat was very neat and unique
The swing was king, it made you tap your feet
There was Benny and Duke and of course the Count Basie
The melody was smooth and yes, very taste
There was Hap, The Prez, and Lady Day and
Dizzy Bird and Miles, they were all playin'
They brought it to the people of the foreign lands
Back across the oceans and the desert sands
Where it echoes in the distant sounds of drums
And it rises with the sun on days begun
This is the music, that we give tribute to
They gave it to us, that's why we give it to you
The jazz music... the jazz music
The jazz music... UH... uh... uh..."

[Guru] ""The music called jazz..""
(Horns)
(Guru)
It's roots are in the sounds of the African
Or should I say the mother... bringin' us back again
From the drummin on the Congo, we came with a strong flow
And continue to grow
Feet move, to the beat of the t'balo
Now dig the story and follow
For then it landed, on American soil
Through the sweat, the blood, and the toil
Hear, ""Praise the Lord,"" shouted on chain gangs
Pain they felt, but it helped them to maintain
Scott Joplin's rags, Bessie Smith's blues
St. Louis blues, they were all the news
Ringin' smooth... in all the listeners ears
Fulfillin the needs, and plantin the seeds
Of a jazz thing
King Oliver's group was a train comin' through
To Chicago, bringin' the New Orleans groove
And when Satchmo blew, the audience knew
Basil Street blues was the whole house tune
It was music... great to dance to
Great to romance to with a lot to say to you
Relaying a message, revealing the essence
Of a jazz thing
(DJ Premier cuts ""jazz music"")
In the 40's came be-bop, the first be-bop
The real be-bop, so let me talk about
Diz' and Byrd, givin' the word
Defining how a beat could be so complete
Playing with ferocity, thinkin' with velocity
About ornathology, or anthropology
And even ?, and this is real history
Theolonious Monk, a melodious thunk
No mistakes were made with the notes he played
His conception, was ?re condite?
A star glowing bright among dim lights
The critics did cite that he sounded all right
Charlie Mingus, such nimble fingers
Droppin' the bass, all over the place
And Max Roach, cymbals socking
Bass drum talking, snare drum rocking
Restructuring... the metaphysics
Of a jazz thing
John Coltrane, a man supreme
He was the cream... he was the wise one
The impression of Afro Blue
And of the promise, that was not kept
He was a GIANT step, and there was Ornette Coleman
He was another soul man
The original invisible, playing great music
I wonder why the ?Bangles? couldn't use it
Now listen see
The real mystery is how music history
Created by white men or any other white man
That pretended he originated ""uh-huh..""
And contended that he innovated ""uh-huh..""
A jazz thing
(""Of course we know who can really blow"")
Scheamin on the meaning
Of a jazz thing
And this music ain't dead, so don't be misled
By those who said that jazz was on it's deathbed
'Cause when Betty Carter sings a song
Ain't nuttin goin' on, but simply good music
And you won't refuse it
She's takin' her time, makin' the nuances rhyme
Sonny Rollins, tenor saxophone
With a big old tone, recitin poems
With notes as words, and haven't you heard
Next stop butter, right past oleo
Now there's young cats blowin'
And more and more people, yes they will be knowin'
Jazz ain't the past, this music's gonna last
And as the facts unfold, remember who foretold
The 90's, will be the decade of
A jazz thing ""I love jazz music"" [x3]
(Primo scratches ""I love jazz music"")
A jazz thing..."

And this is how the story goes
Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
Cause in the night you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a 4-5th, I guess you just might
Want to do a dance or two
Cause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew
No matter if you or your brother's a star
He could pop you and jet without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame
From the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain
That the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck

If you don't run all your jewels and pay
Give up the Rolex watch or you won't see another day”
See, they were on the attack
And one said, “Yo, you want to make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, okay?”
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inching
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings and ran frantic
But shorty said “naw,” pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep

His posse's a nightmare macking jewls and some crazy gear
But as we know these things do come back
And shortys now peeping others that are scheming the kind of act
'Cause the kid that got shot didn't perish so
He pulls up in a jeep with tinted window

Take your time, recline and make your mind up
I feel fine, so I'm gonna wind up
Here's the pitch, check the switch, now watch me
Hit you right to this, while I pursue this
Desire, to get you, on up to step to
Rhythms and rhymes, 'cause I respect you
Unless you're a biting one, a non-writing one
Reciting some of my lines, although you are blind
You'll see my shadow, rather my silhouette
But I'll be glad though, knowin' your pillow's wet
And that you're upset, cause you thought you brought
The answer -- to this dilemma in rap but I'll vamp you with"

Things that those others can't deliver
Contrary to what I had wished, it seems that I've been dissed
But hey, I don't want to miss this
Wonderful opportunity, my boys they try schoolin' me,
But see I know what I want
Someone who'll be there for the whole nine, This honey is so fine,
But now she's hung up the line
Upset because I told her I'm busy, she made like a grizzly
And started chewin' my head off
Screamin' that I spend more time with friends
And also, she said I ruined her weekend
I said ""I know the stuff we had planned, but please understand
Right now I'm loungin' with my man.""
I guess I didn't realize I'd hurt her, she said I had the nerve to
Just neglect her like that
Then she started bringing up past things and she kept asking
How come our love isn't lasting
I said, ""Hey baby, please calm down 'cause I'm still around
And it's for you that my heart pounds
Can I call you later on? You say I treat you wrong?
But why you flippin' on me?""
She said something else and then click
Left me alone on the phone with the tone
And now I'm lovesick
Relationships can grip with the pain
Arguments in the crib, in the streets, on the train
I'm crazy fed but then still
When she ain't there I feel sad, I feel ill
Frowning 'cause I'm down in the dumps
The other night I took her out so she could shake her rump
But after we were there for a few
Some girls that I knew, stepped up and asked me to come to
A party they were havin' at their house
I looked at my girl, and yo, she started walkin' out
I said ""Hey love, just wait for a second
And won't you just check it? It's all a part of makin' records
Those were just some friends in the business
No need to get angry, so listen up while I kick this
And what about the things we discussed
About havin' trust? What's all this attitude stuff?
Now hon, you know that I wouldn't play you
But time after time, you let your jealousy sway you
Hey don't you turn your back like that
Come on, this is wack You're heated up like a thermostat""

First and foremost, some rappers are sweet like fructose
When I cock back these lyrics, y'all punks best be ghost
I be the seven twenty-one, eighteen twenty-one
The illest one, I'm almost doper than anyone
Straight out the late nights of Bed-Stuy
Steppin up, y'all put your weapons up, I make heads fly
You're artificial like saccarhin
You're crazy fake, it's more than skills you be lackin in
Concepts you bite, cause your identity ain't tight
Tryin' to be somethin' you're not, like pullin a knife at a gunfight
I'm troopin on night air like flight number 106
And gettin' all up in your fuckin' mix
You get me upset, and I got you uptight
Cause my committee's in your city tonight, AIGHT?
We got seventeen million of us plus, two million Indians
That makes 19 mil, lightin shit up like Wild Bill
I be the, supreme father plus the ill kid with drama
My karma, creates the teflon to pierce your body armor
And make sure you check the shit before you walk to me, or talk to me
Steppin to me improperly, you just may catch the weaponry
My specialty is tearin tracks out the frame
You know my fuckin' name, I rule all game
I'm universal on all planes, what's your claim?
(Guru)
Yo, I be your highness, in slickness, you chumps bear witness
Tremendous tropper, verbal nigga with he fitness
Drop you for your spot with the blazer then I blast ya
Slice precise like ?fenny hanas? when I come to bring the dramas
Styles so swift, that you can't peep the God
As your lyrics get buried, six feet deep in my backyard
I laugh hard, while your mental I run through mazes
Dark stages of terror to shatter your dressing room mirror
Your whole error gets crushed, your whole show gets bumrushed
Too many dumb punks, want to enter this rap scene
Kickin Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion, the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fuckin' barber
So what you made some dough, you best keep on scramblin
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handlin
Demandin that you pay, for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday
(Krumb Snatcha)
I see myself as the black Rap Messiah
Colossal spreadin my gospel through electrical wires
Spit fire through speech, so I can reach each and every
Tom Dick and Jerry slippin like petroleum jelly
Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight
I got divine right to bring y'all to light
Somethin' ain't right, to be an MC, you gotta thug
Or to thug you gotta be an MC, this shit is bugged
Show love but few; deal with crew and crew only
And think universal like Sony
Phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
Give a fuck like Pizza Hut I got to stay Noyd-ed
Cause that same nigga you trust, could be that same cat
Behind that gat that bust, quiet ya, with the silencer
Keep it hush, ashes to dust, then dust to ashes
Nowadays it's who pull out the fastest, imagine this
Rap shit without this gat shit, or the phony cat
In black talkin' bout how much his Mac spit
But this year, GangStarr got changes bein made
No wack shit bein played no fake macks gettin' paid
No Versace MC's, with a mouth full of Mo'
Soundin like a hoe spittin' that old-fashioned show flow
I bombshell that pastel Chanel rap through a Maxwell
Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Goin' deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with interpretive robe and sandals like Moses
Travellin high sands and Eastern lands for the answers
Ignorance is spreadin through the streets like it was cancer
Too many drinkin' not thinkin', when behind that trigger
A 38 escalate the murder rate, for us niggaz
It's like, microphone roulette cause nowadays MC's is gettin' wet
Over someone else's fake gangsta rep"

These are the words that I manifest, I manifest"
68,Manifest (Remix),1999,Full Clip: A Decade Of Gang Starr (1999),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"I profess and I don't jest cause the words I manifest
They will take you, sedate you, and I will stress upon
You the need for, you all to feed your
Mind and soul, so you can lead your-self
To keep, I got a real objective here
I am effective here, 'cause I select a clear
Message to all, suckers I maul they fall from
Into the pit of purgatory
I go for glory, I take an inventory
Countin' all the tough luck ducks while I narrate
Relate and equate, dictate and debate
My fate is to be, cold makin' history
I use sincerity, but I'm so very deep
Doubts are questions, of all the skeptics
I'm kickin clout and, I'll leave you vexed
It's just true, there's nothing so-so 'cause I know
Right about to spin it I'm in it admit it I did it
To you, cause this is what I'm into
So chill while I instill that we all must fulfill
The proper mission for us and yo this is a must
It's usually lines of my rhymes I ingest
These are the words that I manifest, I manifest
I suggest you take a breath for the words I manifest
They will scold you and mold you, while I impress upon
You the fact that, I use my tact at
Rhymin for climbin, and chill while I attract that
Girl you're with, I got a sincere quality
I give her all of me, 'cause you're too small to be
Tryin' to riff, so let me uplift and shift my gift
Let's go to the fullest capacity
I got tenacity, because I have to be
The brother who must live and give with much insight
Foresight to ignite, excite and delight
And you might gain from it, or feel pain from it
Because I'm ultimate, and I'm about to let off
Knowledge is wisdom, understanding
Truth's the proof, so won't you throw a hand
In the air, put up a peace sign and be fine
If so we're feeling good we should we could we would
Stop, think for a moment OK?
And then sway while I convey that we must do away
With all the stress and the strife, so god bless your life
Use kindness, and never blindness
And you will find that this perspective is best, check it out
These are the words that I manifest, I manifest
I convey that what I say will awaken you today
After jockin while I'm talkin', but anyway
That you put it I give you, lyrics to live to
Righteousness rules, so I forgive you this time
For you are being very ignorant
That's insignificant, I guess you figured and
Hoped to be, dope as me, ID you flee
Because the rest is too much for you
I'm your professor, I got the touch to
Do more than the rest who fess and can't compete
I'm elite I'll defeat delete and mistreat
Make mincemeat of other fools, 'cause I'm the brother who'll
Snatch up the funds and, make lonely ones
I meant it really, 'cause I'm clearly obsessed and I
These are the words that I manifest, I manifest"

No way you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I break kids
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
Their noses, I hate those motherfuckin posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills nah you can't compare me
And no we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin real facts
I represent set up shit like a tent boy

And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

Oh yes I'm greater than all MC's when I breeeze give me room please
I be like fascinatin when I be updatin
Cuttin' off wack kids, pullin their trump cards
I thump hard, and make 'em say that I'm God
Niggaz be pretendin they hardcore
Never know the meaning of (real hardcore)
But I get props like a slogan and no man
Could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connecting complete mic wrecking
No double checking vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to I go all out with no mic
Yeah that's right 'cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel

Verse Three:
I know I'm dope but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks but now I'm makin' greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop
Of pure bomb, just like the seashore I'm calm
But wild, with my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond I go on and on
For you it's tragic I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I betcha
Those who kick dirt and do time I'm gonna get cha

No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth, baby
Chorus: Guru
They say it's lonely at the top and whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth
Verse One: Guru
The same sheisty cats that you hang with, and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up, nigga peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although MC's lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize, what I have done up to this point
So I'mma get more guys, to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate, or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shining, some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish jealous punks, will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it, to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is coming to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth
Hook: Guru
Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth
Verse Two: Guru
Sometimes you gotta dig deep, when problems come near
Don't fear things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen, to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin, is mad amazin
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin in my bedroom pacin'
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin
Suicide? Nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinking, or even gettin' high
Cause all that's gonna do really, is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit, before
So I oughta be able, to withstand some more
But I'm sweatin though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife, and take the bullets out my nine
My only crime, was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect, that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has it's day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, remembering the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth
(""You should know the truth
And the truth shall set you free"" -- from Who's Gonna Take the
Weight?)
Verse Three: Guru
Yo I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one, is pointed at your weak ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger, on these fully loaded lines
You're gonna wish I woulda pulled a black nine, I mack dimes
Crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin triflin niggaz, and the studio pranksters
Yo lookin' at the situation plainly: will you remain G?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator, with the greater data
Revolvin on the TASCAM much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle, tricky metaphors
I explore more, to expose the core
A lot of MC's, act stupid to me
And we have yet to see, if they can match our longevity
But anyway it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Styles, smooth but rugged -- you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin your hideout, blockin out your sunlight
Your image and your business, were truly not done right
Throw up your he-Allah-I now, divine saviors
You got no hand skills there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop, to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
Cause you must meet your moment of truth
Chorus: Guru
They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth"
73,Mostly Tha Voice,1994,Hard To Earn (1994),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"It's mostly tha voice, that gets you up
It's mostly tha voice, that makes you buck
A lot of rappers got flavor, and some got skills
But if your voice ain't dope then you need to (chill... chill...)
Up steps one, and he gets done
Then up steps another, he gets smothered
That's word to mother, or should I say moms
I drop bombs, scorchin niggaz like napalm
Sucka, boy, get off my shit
Get off my dick so what I make butter hits
You better change your behavior, battling Gangstarr
No religion could save ya
My religion is rap, R-A-P
R-E-A-L-I-T-Y, G
'Cause when I rock street kids rejoice
I got mad rhymes, still
So when you think you know the whole you don't even know the half
You're not a threat to myself, and neither to my staff
Not the type to really dance too much, although I used to
Rather bust a fresh line, and get loose to
The blunted ill types of beats Premier makes
Makes your girl's rear shake, let me set it straight
Some rappers use hooks to this shit
But if you took that shit out
And you took all the music out
What would remain? The voice no doubt
Bless my soul I control
When in pimp mode
My bank roll expands
I invest in my man
I plan, to keep rap real
So if your shit ain't fat then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
What about oral sex, which chick's next
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss 'em I just talk to em
Cause the sound, of my voice, it does a lot to em
So you and, the niggaz right there
Be aware, like SWV, I'm right here
Waitin to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now I'll disrespect your ass
More Vicious than Sid, do a crime with no bid
I tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
Take a trip to a land a-far
Then come back, and people still know Gangstarr
See I'm the ladies choice
'Cause I got crazy styles, still
Outro: Guru, Shug
Oh shit Shug, whattup
(Whassup money?)
Just loungin, about to go do this shit in the studio
(Oh yeah, you just let me get on that shit
You always said I could get on, you need to let me get on that)
Word?
(For real man)
Yo man
(Don't front on that shit)
I'm sayin' yo, if I let you get busy, youknowhatI'msayin
You can't be dissapointin me

Other MCs in the place know I'm much too much
And I'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
All wannabe's are never ever gonna be nothin'
Gang Starr's in the house and we're crushing
So suckers better be up on their p's and q's and
Competition come against me and you're losing
I'll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed 'cause you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cashflow comin'
And never had no problems getting women
I'm like a catalyst causin' a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist ad now the main attractionn
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That's why the people say that I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
Verse Two:
Check the G-U-R-U yes the brother who's progressing
If beats are cake I'm frosting, if salad I'm dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
And kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I'm gettin' kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I'm due and it's true 'cause you know
A rapper this nice oughtta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch 'em later
'Cause I'm like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn't matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape 'cause I'm much too much
Verse Three:
I walk in the room unload a boom that's like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I've rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
'Cause the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I'm swift like the breeze
I'll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That's the type of crap you know I'm not buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don't apply and
That's why I've come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I'm controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That's why everybody knows that I'm much too much

Word is bond these cats been on the mic fantasizing a LOT
So called MC's wannabe rappers and all that whatever
You get your knot rocked kid yo
Chorus: Guru
You thought you brought your best lines but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time
(Repeat 2X)
Verse One: Guru
So just perhaps you wanna challenge my style of rap
Talkin' 'bout you bust caps, we know that's just a pile of crap
The underground is where I dwell at
It's where I find my heaven, and where you find your hell at
You're in my clutches now, you get slit up and lit up
Just like some Dutches now, see I'm hard to define
My mind travels far, from ghettoes to galaxies
Representin GangStarr -- The street life
The reason why my mic ignites, I bring more ruckus
Than a nightclub fight, or bar brawl
I'm swingin' lyrics like broken glass palm to skull y'all
Hold your head, cause all that weak shit is dead
See the times are changin, and me and my peeps is gettin' crazy fed
So remember when you writing your rhymes
Stop fantasizing, and bring some real shit next time
Yeah, bring some real shit, yo
Verse Two: Guru
Yo, I do what I have to do to master you and capture you
Until you recognize, what my rapture can do
You thought I wouldn't step up, to keep my rep up
I ain't them other kids, I don't need to play no catchup
I got too much pride for this, I know some niggaz
That'll ride for this, with me it's do or die for this
Street knowledge, intellect and spirituality
My survival package, as I deal with reality
I'm like Fishburne in Hoodlum when I come to do em
Chew 'em up, spit 'em out, the most respected no doubt
You seen me in action so act you been knowin'
The G-U-R-U, of the Gang, I've been flowing
Just like the river Niger all the way to the Hudson
Had so many lyrics stashed, and I couldn't wait to bust some
Lately, I've watched this game evolve and elevate
So now I push my music like drug dealers push weight
Straight like that, straight out the gate
'Cause it's never too late, to set this fuckin' record straight
But it is too late, for you and your crew son
You had the audacity to come against me, the gifted one?
And Primo with the tracks, to inspire my next line
You've got no wins here, so better luck next time
Chorus (cut short in 2nd repeat at ""I rocked you in your knot..."")
Yeah yeah
Better luck next time

To take my kindness, for weakness, 'cause they don't seem to
Respect my generosity, and what it's costin me
Is headaches, I don't like fakes, or people bossin me around
You clown, it's time I beat you down
You tried to play me betray me and slay me, and now you'll drown
In the river, I'll give ya, reasons you should shiver
'Cause when I get to wreckin and deckin, I won't forgive ya
You had the opportunity, for bein cool with me
You stabbed me in the back you duck, and now you're soon to be
Disarmed, embalmed, I'll break off all your arms

And spill your yolk, you joke, I'll duff you in the eye

Yo ?, this is somethin' that I wanna tell to you, sell to you
And as I speak you girlies yell to your friends, ""Yo it's him!
He's shockin again!"" This is the season for breezin with reason
Because I'm in, charge of the attack on suckers who just rap on
Wack track that lack that snap, while I just mack on
Honies who look good and, they all want the wood in
They push up, to get up close, to serve me puddin'
And I just tell em, ""Look here, I am not a crook there""
But I like to snatch 'em all, cause like a hook they're stuck
Struck, they tried to press their luck
They wanna tease me and skeeze me and please me, to squeeze the bucks
From my pocket that is bulging, I'm not indulging
In lame games with phony dames, too busy buildin my fortress
Score this, drink while I pour this
I'm livin' and givin' my rhymes, so I'll ignore this
Garbage you are runnin', I am not the one and
You'll never get to vamp me tramp 'cause I'll be stunning your mind
I'll sign, my name on your behind and cool you off
Like frost, I'm leary of the way you double cross
Get lost, I'll tell you you are fly and say goodbye
And burning and yearing you'll ask my why
And I'll reply with a wink of an eye, ""There'll be no more Mr. Nice Guy""
No More Mr. Nice Guy
No More Mr. Nice Guy
Oh sure, you're, running back for me
I'ma great you defeat you and beat you, show you the door
Cause you ain't really welcome, you know you're seldom
Thinkin' of your fellow man, but you still till them
You wanna be a friend then, you keep pretendin
You're two-faced, so you'll taste, just what I'm sendin
POW, now, you're shaken sayin' WOW
You stare, you fear, my wrath is too severe
I never let up so get up I'm fed up, and I don't care
I'll duff you in the eye and you'll say, ""Why?""

83,No Shame In My Game,1992,Daily Operation (1992),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"As I deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
I'm dead up serious so don't be getting too curious
Motherfuckers always wanna know what makes me tick
I'll pull a phrase out quick 'cause I'm dipped and I'm slick
You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinking forty's
It shocked you then you told your friends you saw me
Well say what you want 'cause all of mine is in tact
In fact I'll have you open like a hookers gap
I like to catch a buzz 'cause I get into the beats more
MC's are washed up like dead fish on the seashore
Save the talk 'cause you know I walk that walk
Hitting city to city but I make my home in New York
I know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru I'll diss you if you're pressing the issue
Not my style to be sweatin' all the stupid ass rumors
I take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you're scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
Don't even think about it 'cause ain't no shame in my game
No shame in my game
Stick to the subject I ain't afraid to be real
A lot of MC's fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don't like the prankster crap
So I get passed all that by kicking straight up facts
There ain't no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don't use it than you may catch grief
Toolies and techs ain't toys but kids got 'em today
And if they're ready to spray best get the fuck out the way
I try keeping my sanity by thinking of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I'll climb
But what the hell's success if the mess ain't changing
50's still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin'
Stick up kids still stickin' nasty hookers still trickin'
All the pimps still pimpin' and all the crackheads trippin'
While the dealers still sellin' so I'll refrain from the yellin'
And the preachin' 'cause who the fuck would I reach man
Niggaz don't wanna stop that, they wanna live fat
Who'd wanna clean up their act when the papes come in stacks
They live for the minute and they're all wrapped up in it
It's an unfortunate state for many it's too late
Now death stalks the streets and it's right at your gate
So bug, lose your mind but I ain't goin' insane
I'll kick the fly lyrics 'cause ain't no shame in my game
No shame in my game
Life's a bitch so who are we to judge each other
I know I got faults I ain't the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn't too cool you know
Like how you smoke wools and that your girl's a ho
But I don't listen to shit unless the story's legit
Knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be riding the dilsnick
But I'll be taking care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhyming you know I'm hitting hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you'll feel pain
You little sucker, there ain't no shame in my game"

Hang your punk ass from a limb, they'll have to cut you down
See I'm tired of you faggots kickin dirt on my name
While you rap clone phonies only hurtin' the game
I'm too persistent, plus I flow too vicious
Bout to expose you hoes, this shit is too twisted
Rappers be actin', like they rich or somethin'
When they get robbed like a herb, that's what they get for frontin
I'm in the top ten, one of the best of all time
Been known to drop men - who CARES if the rest of y'all rhyme?
You're mediocre son, you're barely average kid
Your style's Chi-Chi, wanna see me crack yo' cabbage kid?

While you spread rumors, I'ma dead you junior
Have your mind blown, poundin your dome like head tumors
Family tradition when I'm randomly spittin'
And girls love my voice, they say it's handsomely different
I never won awards, no Grammys and things
Back in the days did sticks, made niggaz hand me they rings
What goes around comes around, they tried me later
But I survived all the thugged out, grimey capers
My concepts caused more panic than bomb threats
Don't take me for granted because I'm calm and shit
'Cause when I FLIP, I'ma take over the ship
Controllin this grip with one hand holdin' my dick

At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort
In the midst of war, I find peace within
Run, lock your doors, don't let the beast get in
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
I show love 'cause it's a terrible thing to hate
Of course I want money, but I won't compromise
Y'all don't realize, think I won't bomb you guys?
With the truth nigga, stop misleadin the youth nigga
Too many wakes and funerals, that's the proof nigga

We represent the pain that's real talk, what's y'all claim to fame?
Rappers simply tracin flows and chasin hoes
Frontin mad hard, that shit's amazin yo
Producers makin' Tinkerbell beats for them to rhyme on
Their ass if they get on the same stage that I'm on
Our shit be rugged, like the New York streets
Make the wrong move stupid then you lose your seat
Cats be buyin up SoundScans to beef up sales
Niggaz wanna crossover, wanna be upscale
Fuck that, that ain't hip-hop, that's somethin' else
You're better off back on the ave doin' somethin' else
All you suckers claimin that you are, thug or gangsta
You disrespect the game by dry-snitchin you prankster
I thank y'all for makin' more room for us, uh
Ashes to dust you wonder who's to trust
My sense of self, and my mental health
Is much more powerful, than any hint of wealth
A lot of niggaz get cash, and collect Mercedes
But neglect their ladies, and forget their babies
Then the chicks turn and act like dudes
'Cause they reflect our light, so yo act right fool
And this is just a piece of my mind, a thesis of mine
I'ma make moves and I'ma leave you behind
At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort

We're kicking wannabes down 'cause we're gonna be down
We're moving on with the sound, see we're gonna be around
For a long time, I kick the strong rhymes
You're empty-handed and stranded cause you were standing in the wrong line
This is not the fate is for sure a pure pen
The gift is hitting home on your dome because we meant it
You'll need a graffiti, don't heed and you'll be bleeding
We'll rip you, and ship you back and you'll be repeating
The progress, and I guess that you should be told now
Lo and behold how the stroll I unfold now
Knowledge, wisdom, and peace are what I'm true to
In the rear is Premier, and I'm the Guru
(Premier scratches)
I sound greater because I'm head of the committee
I chill in New York City, I'm witty, so get me
To Brooklyn, so I can ill and peace no joke
You slow poke, you'll go broke, you're rhymes ain't all that dope
So take a backseat, with all your wack beats
This is the one phase of my rage and onstage I slap eats
For you to try to steal this, I will reveal this
Like a prophet, I'll drop it, Premier will start to seal
This coffin to be chewing, you soft and you'll be doing
A dance with some ants in the ground, you clowns be chewing
But you could never get this, the talents we've been blest with
So many different ways to phrase, you shouldn't mess with the Guru
(Premier scratches)
So here's the verdict, cause all you suckers know you're booty
You're played out, you'll fade out, I doubt that you can do me
We ain't having no gabbing, when I be grabbing and jabbing
In your ear like a spear prepare your body for battling
'Cause you've been preparing to move, you'll be certain to lose
Open your eyes up, wise up while I work with the groove
To teach your next school, who'll be the next fool?
That I can stomp down with compound nouns but like a pestule
Come back with dumb raps, then like a tech inside
I'll take you out your misery you ought to step aside
Your weak rap, you speak that yang so Imma clue you
The DJ's name is Premier, and I'm the Guru
I'm telling you, '89 is mine. Peace"

Stupid, you know it's time to sit and think, before we hit the brink

Like when I tell these corporate leeches they can't get a thing
Or when I tell relentless rappers they had better sing
The position that anyone holds could be up to grabs
I'm waitin up the ave to see if anyone folds

I knew the difference between gimmicky gangsters and powerful people
I'm the reason, why the game is flipped
I'm the reason, why your aim is missed
I'm the reason why you're mad I only sprained my wrist
The reason my mindframe is trained in this
You like gunfire? Better acquire the taste
'Cause youf walk aroun' with full pounds by dem waist

Uneasy niggaz blink, when I step to the stage
And don't flinch, don't move a inch, I'm bout to empty the gauge

Always dreamed about what I would do, if I had shit
Drop jewels infinite for the blind deaf and dumb
Down with M.O.P. and Bumpy plus I just left Krumb

But I'm back... ha, fresh out of the max
And I'm gettin' at you cats
Aiyyo popped out the beast, met The Ownerz with the lease

Learned a whole lot up in these streets
Like when to talk, when to spark, and when not to speak
I do the one before a gun come out
Plus y'all don't really wanna see Krumb dumb out
A ghetto doctrine to watch every pistol pop
And then while you watchin examine all options
Young bodies in the coffin more often
It stay the same from Brooklyn to Boston
Every interstate, more youth with the inner hate
Deep in the struggle, puttin' food on they dinner plate

RIOT ACT, time to protect our communities
Riot act, real criminals get immunity
RIOT ACT, eye for an eye - so yo who want it?
RIOT ACT, rushin all you cowards who fronted
Riot act, let's bring the power to the people
RIOT ACT, no justice then we gotta come see you
(Verse One: Guru)
Just like a thunderous gun clap, you wonder who done that
Put you under with one rap, me and the brothers have come back
We'll lash you for tryin' that, we know you been lyin' cat
So now you be lyin' flat, we'll read you the riot act
Whassup you little fuck, get your life right
Cause there's too much goin' in the world, and shit ain't quite right
See you're just addin to the problem
Young gun, high-strung, ready to trey-eight revolve 'em
Knot nearly in your waist, you step up in the place
Catch one off guard, he lookin' silly in the face
But hear they come with the M-16's
They got teargas, helmets and clubs - knahmean?
It's martial law in these streets
It's like Afghanistan man, it's gettin' raw in the streets
Still you demand your rights, I understand your plight
But do the knowledge if you plan to fight
(Verse Two: Guru)
So realize what it is to be oppressed and afflicted
Subjected to sick shit, knowin' others live different
FUCK THAT, the streets about to blow again
They forgot, so we gotta let 'em know again
Huh, we'll blast you for tryin' that, we know you been lyin' cat
So now you be lyin' flat, we'll read you the riot act
Soldiers, let's show these cowards what's up
The hood ain't goin' for it, let's get ours, that's what's up
Be sure to keep a balance to your fight
And do the math, figure how to use your talents in a fight
Ain't nuttin worse than a rebel without a cause
Ain't nuttin worse than a people without laws
200 million square miles under attack
Reperations for us blacks, hell yeah, they need to come with that
Who's gonna take the weight, and erase the hate
All I know is when we come through, better make some space
(Verse Three: Guru)
A lot of people ain't happy you can tell by their ways
It's growin' tense okay, I can smell it today
Tenement buildings house the next killers
While rich diplomats, are purchasin their next villas
But for the scrilla and power, uh
They'll send some killers to their hood, that are iller than ours
Still niggaz settle beef, with the metal piece
And every block stays hot, like the devil's feet
Incarceration of the mind, police brutality and poverty
These are realities of mankind
And we can't win nigga, if we keep shuckin and jivin
In a minute, they gon' have us duckin and divin
They got bullets for us {*automatic fire*} yeah, uh-huh
They got jail cells and graveyards, they the bullies, not us

Troublesome, to anyone who stands in the way
I'll stand and I'll spray, FUCK if ya man is in the way
Your girl want me 'cause I do it better than you
The whole world wants me nigga, I'ma legend to you
Like LL, Rakim, Ice-T and them niggaz

If you got niggaz under pressure, you could take they shit
Listen, I'ma leave you right where you stand
Have the ambulance pass ya Timberlands off right to ya man
'Cause he pussy, he ain't gonna do nothin' but look
When it come to beef, he don't wanna do nothing but cook
As soon as the chrome scope him, right there, two in the dome
Smokin', Kiss keep funeral homes open
I fall back, smoke an ounce in the dark
Bounce on a Preme track like I bounce on a NARC
Keep playin', y'all niggaz will burn
And you know they say it takes somethin' to happen for niggaz to learn
Let the .40 Cal give 'em a perm

Flow is angry like I'm in your face with heaters
Chasin divas - nah, I don't ever have to do that
P.I. till I die and I laugh at you cats
You happy perhaps 'cause you got dough and bitches
But no love from streets only for moles and snitches
Only from the meatlapin, suckers won't see it happen
Cross that line, then it's time for the heat clappin

Peace Brother Elijah
Hey peace Guru, how you doin'?
I'm maintainin
Just been thinkin' though man
About the situation for today's youth man, the seeds man
What's your opinion on that?
Mmm that's strange I was thinkin' the same thing
Somethin' I read in the holy Qu'ran how it says
""Has thou seen him who belies religion?
That is one who is rough, to the orphan.""
And no matter what we say our religion is
Whether it's Islam, Christianity
Juddaism, Buddha-ism, Old School-ism or New School-ism
If we're not schooling the youth WITH wisdom
Then the sins of the father will visit the children
And that's not keepin' it real...
That's keepin' it -- WRONG
Chorus: Guru
Now that we're gettin' somewhere, you know we got to give back
For the youth is the future no doubt that's right and exact
Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leary
It's our inheritance; this is my Robbin Hood Theory... Robbin Hood Theory
Verse One: Guru
I seek Sun, deceive none, for each one must teach one
At least one must flow and show the structure, of freedom
It's me Dunn, cause petty things we don't need 'em
Let's focus to create somethin' great, for all that sees them
They innocent, they know not what they face
While politicians save face genius minds lay to waste
If I wasn't kickin rhymes I'd be kickin down doors
Creatin' social change and defendin the poor
The God's always been militant, and ready for war
We're gonna snatch up the ringleaders send 'em home in they drawers
But first where's the safe at? Let's make 'em show us
And tell 'em hurry up, give up the loot that they owe us
We bringin' it back, around the way to our peeps
Cause times are way too deep, we know the Code of the Streets
Meet your defeat; this is my Robbin Hood Theory... my Robbin Hood Theory
Verse Two: Guru
I floss my rhymes like dentals, my mental's presidential
From the wild ghetto districts to the plush resedential
Essential, would be the message that I send you
I meant to, elevate at every venue
Pops told me to pursue what is true, and nothing other
And nowadays I pave the way for troops of my young brothers
Necessary by all means, sort of like Malcolm
Before it's too late; I create, the best outcome
So I take this opportunity, yes to ruin the
Devilish forces fuckin' up my black community
And we ain't doin' no more interviews
Till we get paid out the frame, like motherfuckin Donahue
We're taking over radio, and wack media
Cause systematically they gettin' greedier and greedier
Conquering turfs with my ill organization
Takin' out the man while we scan the information
You wanna rhyme you best to wait son
You can't even come near, if you ain't got our share
You front on us this year, consider yourself blown out of here
Yeah... by my Robbin Hood Theory
Verse Three: Guru
God is Universal, he is the Ruler Universal
For those who can't follow that spells GURU when in my circle
I see all sides of my culture...
Design my thoughts like a sculpture
And chumps they wanna get with me 'cause I'm another entity
I'm sent to be, leadin the army of the century
Mention me, and snakes will retreat, eventually...
... Due to my Robbin Hood Theory"

(Verse One: Guru)
The names have been changed to protect the innocent
Each step is intricate, I rep magnificent
Knew this kid named Ronnie, used to make cash with Caesar
They made a lot of money back in the 80's crack fever
Caesar was an overachiever, a kingpin and 18-and-a-half
He got knocked and left Ronnie to watch the team and the stash
Plus his crib, his jewels, his whip and his girl
And Ronnie's self-interests had him livin' in a different world
He rocked Caesar's chains, he put Caesar's rings
Smokin' mad wools all day, with Caesar's change
Not to mention he pushed up on Caesar's wifey
A move like that my man, extremely sheisty
It all got back to Caesar in the bing
They found Ronnie's body in the playground by the swings
Anyone can get it, for sure it don't matter dawg
Especially when a nigga tries committin sabotage

Treachery, deception, it's best to keep a weapon

It's over for the cowardly, we grow more potent hourly
I'm knowin' where the power be, I'm schemin to get even
Dissension can occur from within one's ranks
The chain can be weakened, by just one link
Pricks be galavantin from one crew to the next
Musical click-ass niggaz catch two to the chest
My usual guess is that they chose to digress
Disillusioned by greed, causin you to distress
Just do what's best, clean house, leave out
Them punks can't touch what they can't peep out
See I'm a raw nigga, and like my pops I'm a lawgiver
Can't throw a wrench in my game, I'm a boss figure
Take you under my wing, it don't matter God
Dead you if you try to commit, sabotage
Rise for me now, kneel for me now
Time to pass judgment, can't feel for you now
Lay in your bed, accept your fate
Try to clean it up, except you're late
From the streets to the industry, peep the chemistry

101,"Same Team, No Games",2003,The Ownerz (2003),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"(Stratched) let the games begin
(Guru talking) part 2 ok I just go whenever I feel like? ok lets go
Do the knowledge to the master building blowing a split
The new millinium, hirem a biff
I gotta watch what I say to you niggas in my conversation
Cause this shit ain't really passed the statue of limitation
The streets still holla about strong I am
Niggas I hurt still holla bout wrong I am
As a little nigga slow baking soda and coke
Had me amazed how my steady hand kept it afloat
Let it sit cool and harden hit the set
Cool and heartless in front of the store projects
As long as I made a profit I see you eyeing me
Your fires can't diary
Filled with pages of episodes of shying me
Nah believe me I'm a hammer for hire
Hit your ass so close that you coat will catch fire
Dog the stakes is dire
I'm no liar
Hold a court in the street b
'Cause I got priors
Same team, no games
Keep chicks that blow brains
Rappers rock soul train
The corners rocking dope game
Got no shaaaame
Trying to build these figures
Headquarters left ain't gone he still with us
Not in the physical the way he once lived
I can see him will big l, pun, pac and big
Watching the kid like hell shig the waist over
And hail that ether blow out and take over
I'm the truth
Give you booth and your video shoot
Pull those camerons on you
While them cameras on you
How you love that?
Don't wanna bump with stats
So pull your head up
Don't make me call crumb up
It's the militia
Ya niggas don't know bout i
Got me heated frustrated bout to blow my high
Me and penz blazing
Rave got the gauge razing
Sick of talking about a niggas aim on my waist man
United we stand together
Down for whatever
Divided we get at you from all angles
Gangstarr for bare
Then why he saying same team no games
Love is love man one and the same
Funny style niggas act strange
Going against the grain
Don't wanna see us on top of our thing
We adapt to change
Fame, fortune, and material gain
Flow stay natural unrestrained
Let me explain
Niggas don't get it till you set it aflame
Subject 'em to pain
Make 'em respect the name you said you repped
Connect you claim
Stay ready to bang
Steps ahead of competetors
Just to test your aim
Each dead you wreck say
Splat and dead your brain
My foundation bust gats
Splat and dead your brain
Fuck with mine SPLAT
And ill take your chain
I play for keeps and I came to win
Yo I'm the jerry rice to this
Much to nice to quit
And just so you know
We never liked you kid
Cause you ain't never wanna laet niggas eat
So I'm gonna convene with my team
Before I gotta let the trigga speak
Cause now a days
Y'all niggas are carbon copies
Y'all bars are sloppy
Still its hard to stop me
Especially when I connect with my man
Rep with my fans
We taking back the rest of our land
And we don't really care if they say your the shit
They playing your hits
We bout to make our way in this bitch
And lastly if you take your ass to the next season
In a flash take your stupid as out
Give me the next reason
Flip while my peoples here
Spit while my people here
Time for me to get rich with my people here
Cut off a snakes head
Then we break bread
Same team no games
You on the ground trying to fake dead"
102,Say Your Prayers,1991,Step In The Arena (1991),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"So many things will happen that one can't explain
You find yourself saying ""who me"", time and again
They say what goes around, comes around
Ahun, so think about it while you're messing up clown
A mother's love and a father's concern
Here is the reason you should listen and learn
'Cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
I know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
But take it from somebody who knows
'Cause after all the highs, you're gonna feel all the lows
This is why knowledge of self is essential
'Cause if you don't have it, you may simply go mental
See, life is not a thing to be toyed wit
'Cause every second, another dream is destroyed wit
The systematic plan devised to erase us
And straight to hell is where they're trying to take us
But never fold and hold back your fears
Have a strong mind and try to say your prayers"
103,She Knowz What She Wantz,1998,Moment Of Truth (1998),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"This jam is dedicated
To that woman that knows what she wants
And just how to get it, word up
She knows what she wants (2X)
Yo, she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants and just how to get it
She knows what she wants
Yeah, she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants and just how to get it
She knows what she wants, she's bold so she flaunts
Her hourglass jewels to mad clientele
Rejected oh well, she ain't goin' to no hotel
Not the frantic freak type, but if you speak right
You get to take her out and dig her out on a weeknight
Weekends, she wants to spend your ends
Her shopping spree is colossal, attitude semi-hostile
Mack diva senorita, no reefer, no pizza, just
Shrimp and lobsters, champagne and mobsters
Suckin up the cream like a vac to a carpet
Strictly black market now you're her next target
Watch out... cause yo she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants (2X)
Yo, she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants and just how to get it
Spotted her in the club, with her crew nearby
Her looks are a lullaby, to pass us by, she's too fly
Never gunshy, hair is blown dry
She craves a wiseguy to help her gain amplify
So when you say, ""Yo baby,"" she ain't gotta say hi to ya
Cause prior to this, he put rocks on her neck and wrist
Plus a fat joint on her finger
You best to have a batch of scratch and treats to bring her
And if you happen to luck up and get in
You'll find yourself another jealous trick-ass boyfriend
And furthermore the mink she's donning is stunning
Blinding your senses Dunn, never put the two
Before the one son...
""It's the lesson well learned""
""It's going down!""
*Scratched* ""It's the lesson well learned""
""It's going down!""
She knows what she wants (2X)
Yo, she knows what she wants
Yeah, she knows what she wants and just how to get it
Never fall victim to a chicken you was stickin
Even if you think the punanny might be finger-lickin'
Never fall victim to a wicked woman's ways
""Why son?"" She's trying to get paid, check it
One: She said she wanted to give me a son
Two: She said she didn't like my crew
Three: She never ever cooked for me
Four: She was my cheri amore -- Yeah RIGHT
It was all hype, I needed more insight
In retrospect, I know I slept from the first night
She did a split and that was it
Gave up my pimp license, and flipped my whole friggin script
But now I'm back like the Isley's moving wisely
Sizing up the situation, keeping honies waiting
'Cause I got more to do, than to be sucked dry
This tough guy, will get by, while the chickens wonder why
I don't be callin 'cause it's like Ex to Next kid
I know what I want, and just how to get it
Like her, no disrespect Miss"

106,So Wassup?!,1999,Full Clip: A Decade Of Gang Starr (1999),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"So wassup? You know we can't be havin' that
Son there's rules you're supposed to go by, and this is my habitat
You say you're R-E-P-R-E, S-E-N-T-I-N-G
You're fronting boy, come against me
You're crazy soft while I come off with credibility
You're living in a fantasy world kid, you're killing me
I start to work out, you start to merk out
My shit be crazy raw, and out here, I got more clout
I'm right in your streets, like I'm Urban Outreach
I don't mean to preach but I'll impeach your phony form of speech
Rhyme perfection, injecting like the surgeon
While you be in the club posing, trickin always splurgin
Whatever you got, I'm gettin' more
See you're insecure, and you can catch my verbal four-four
Now you're facing me, I'm your ultimate challenger
It's the Avenger, your fate is on my calendar
Notice the spirit I possess is more than holy
I'm Gifted, Unlimited, ah fuck the rest you know niggaz know me
My lines illuminate your whole spectrum
Crush your dome section, punks I wreck em, mics I bless em
I don't know why, MC's would want to test the man so fly
Master of self gaining wealth
'Cause I'm a mastermind, I stack my rhymes
Just for the rainy day, and you can pour out your forty
For all the rappers I slay, I bring the bounty back
I got more game than the Mack, when I procees to feed the masses
I come right and exact, and all those null and voids
They shall be destroyed, so don't be stickin our your hand
Cause you ain't my fuckin' homeboy
I celebrate after each duck I eliminate
This rap game they desecrate, I'm back to set it straight
I'm self-made and self-taught
You're style you bought, plus
I got the fundamentals handed down from my pops
Hobbes your mission, is worthless
Your style's mad nervous, let's strecth out all our lyrics
And let's see whose go the furthest, word cause
It's puzzling how trifling you be
You're faking making people think that you're a true MC
You best flee, because I've come with the science
I'm gonna melt down your lies and unmask your phony alliance
Extreme house winds, will bring electrical shockwaves
Knocking you out the box kid, is something I crave
You were gassed from the beginning so your bubble must bust
I've been laying in the cut, to tear your bitch ass up
So wassup?!"
107,Soliloquy Of Chaos,1992,Daily Operation (1992),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Five carloads deep, time to go do a show
Got a massive crew and we're ready to roll, so
I grab my gear hop in the whip and ride
Premier he's got the fly dope system inside
But my shit cranks too and we've got mad tapes
Of all the underground groups with the lyrics and bass
Off into the New York night we go
Dre Large got the camera, Biggest Gord's got three rolls of film
So we can take the macked out photos
Tommy Hill, the Damaja, and my man Gusmo
Corey and Smurf, and Lil Dap's got a forty
My man Gary and Shiz and the Nutcracker shorty
Mike Rone, chillin' like Capone
Robinhood, known as Mel with the clientele
Mo, J.T. Mega, and can't forget Black
Big Rob and Sincere, yes, the posse's fat
Outloud pulls up, plus there's Sid and O.C.
Big Mel from Strong Island, H.L. the one and only
O'Delicious, Eli, 'Bazz, and Eon
And the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyond
And to the rest of the crew you know the bond is strong
And you know who's who, so let me not prolong
For this was a night to remember
I had on the beige Tims with the two-tone leather
So we get to the jam, the gig, the venue
Then we circled around and then drove in through
The front - the place was packed, the line was long
I was bobbing my head 'cause the music was on
I turned it down, then I peeped to my right
I saw this kid and his girl having a fight
Another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
And then the kid pulled out and bust him and laid him to waste
A riot broke out, girls screaming and scheming crews
Started buck wiling tryna' snatch kids' jewels
After that, 5-0 came and turned the party out
And then the ambulance came to take the body out
And we didn't even get all the equipment out
And we didn't even get to turn the place out
This can happen often and it's really fucked up
So I'll ask you to your face, homeboy, what's up?
Did you come to see my show or to the stupid nigga playoffs?
Killing you and killing me, it's the soliloquy of chaos
And if you live in cities where the streets reek warfare
People getting nowhere but you go for yours there
You'll find it doesn't pay to front or play the role
You could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
Then you'll wanna retaliate, regroup, and come back
So you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
Whether you die or kill them, it's another brother dead
But I know you'll never get that through your head
'Cause we're mislead and misfed facts, we're way off
Killing you and killing me, it's the soliloquy of chaos"

110,Speak Ya Clout,1994,Hard To Earn (1994),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Verse One: Jeru the Damaja
Last year record companies were chumpin me
But now like chicks they all be up on me
And me so horny, I hit 'em like a groupie
Snatch off my hat wash my dick and keep it movin
Showing and proving on a day to day basis
I rip New York and a million different places
State to state country to country
My skills are legend in the style of poetry
I've paid my dues to this game word to mother
Peace New York hops it gets no rougher
Baby brother been puffing buddha and blunts since eighty-five
Before the fake motherfuckers started perpetrating live, I've
Achieved mad props though niggaz roll around in jeeps
I ride the A-Train and get mad beeps
So when we bang bang boogie out jumps my boot knocks
Chicks comes in flocks when D.R.S. rocks glocks
And I mean it it's all done with the mind
I neutralize suckers because I'm alkaline
I could go on for days speaking bout my clout
So Lil Dap snatch the mic and show the motherfucker out
Verse Two: Lil Dap
Yo you can't hide from jail and you can't hide from the street
Flavors do get deep when you're walking the east
A unit down from the underground made the brothers unite
I'm slappin pounds and pounds with real niggaz aight
Ain't nothing changed but the weather, rain storms or whatever
You poured a forty on the ground for the brothers who ain't around
Break it down with the flow as I walk through the ghetto
A nigga said he couldn't do it till the shit hits the fan
Last year I was The Man ripping up every jam
So what's your hobby nothing serious when things get rough
I'm stepping rugged and tough, and bitches won't get enough
A Lil Dap what's that? Fuck around you get slapped
Schizophrenic with rhyme plus we're well organized
Make the chicks say 'aow' and the brothers say 'ho'
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life
Niggaz tend to live trife, so I react with the mic
It's the end of the time so I got to gets mine
Aiyyo 'ru, what's your function meet me at Broadway junction
Before I start to get in it, better yet I just kick it
Aiyyo son, if you're ready Guru starts to flip it
Verse Three: Guru
Earl, with my three-eight-five shot I bust a bumba claat
He talks dumb a lot so him shall drop
I got the clout, all you pussy rappers be out
From the ghetto I let go, shit to make you petrol
Watching fly niggaz show you how to rhyme asshole
You know the motherfucking situation
So get down get down with the Gangstarr Foundation
Now I'ma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me
And all the honies be loving me
My style be kicking crazy butt
Wannabes on their knees licking crazy butt
Your girl pays me but ain't no need to try and stop her
I'm Big Poppa steal your girl and I'll drop her
'Cause she be working on my nerves
And yo I got more gang than the bitch got curves
I'm like gambino, the slick head honcho
Ill kid ready to wreck mics pronto
And I know, I break your back with my rap like smack
Because I'm all that
And so the next time when you're wishing for my downfall
I'm a come back to drown y'all
With stupid lyrics relative to a bloodbath
And stay the fuck out my path..."
111,Speak Ya Clout,1999,Full Clip: A Decade Of Gang Starr (1999),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Verse One: Jeru the Damaja
Last year record companies were chumpin me
But now like chicks they all be up on me
And me so horny, I hit 'em like a groupie
Snatch off my hat wash my dick and keep it movin
Showing and proving on a day to day basis
I rip New York and a million different places
State to state country to country
My skills are legend in the style of poetry
I've paid my dues to this game word to mother
Peace New York hops it gets no rougher
Baby brother been puffing buddha and blunts since eighty-five
Before the fake motherfuckers started perpetrating live, I've
Achieved mad props though niggaz roll around in jeeps
I ride the A-Train and get mad beeps
So when we bang bang boogie out jumps my boot knocks
Chicks comes in flocks when D.R.S. rocks glocks
And I mean it it's all done with the mind
I neutralize suckers because I'm alkaline
I could go on for days speaking bout my clout
So Lil Dap snatch the mic and show the motherfucker out
Verse Two: Lil Dap
Yo you can't hide from jail and you can't hide from the street
Flavors do get deep when you're walking the east
A unit down from the underground made the brothers unite
I'm slappin pounds and pounds with real niggaz aight
Ain't nothing changed but the weather, rain storms or whatever
You poured a forty on the ground for the brothers who ain't around
Break it down with the flow as I walk through the ghetto
A nigga said he couldn't do it till the shit hits the fan
Last year I was The Man ripping up every jam
So what's your hobby nothing serious when things get rough
I'm stepping rugged and tough, and bitches won't get enough
A Lil Dap what's that? Fuck around you get slapped
Schizophrenic with rhyme plus we're well organized
Make the chicks say 'aow' and the brothers say 'ho'
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life
Niggaz tend to live trife, so I react with the mic
It's the end of the time so I got to gets mine
Aiyyo 'ru, what's your function meet me at Broadway junction
Before I start to get in it, better yet I just kick it
Aiyyo son, if you're ready Guru starts to flip it
Verse Three: Guru
Earl, with my three-eight-five shot I bust a bumba claat
He talks dumb a lot so him shall drop
I got the clout, all you pussy rappers be out
From the ghetto I let go, shit to make you petrol
Watching fly niggaz show you how to rhyme asshole
You know the motherfucking situation
So get down get down with the Gangstarr Foundation
Now I'ma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me
And all the honies be loving me
My style be kicking crazy butt
Wannabes on their knees licking crazy butt
Your girl pays me but ain't no need to try and stop her
I'm Big Poppa steal your girl and I'll drop her
'Cause she be working on my nerves
And yo I got more gang than the bitch got curves
I'm like gambino, the slick head honcho
Ill kid ready to wreck mics pronto
And I know, I break your back with my rap like smack
Because I'm all that
And so the next time when you're wishing for my downfall
I'm a come back to drown y'all
With stupid lyrics relative to a bloodbath
And stay the fuck out my path..."
112,Stay Tuned,1992,Daily Operation (1992),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Verse One:
Get with this get with this
Get with this 'cause you got no choice
Rappers sometimes you'll find make dough
But yo you know they've got no voice
Get him off the podium he ain't no speaker
Yes he's just a phony and look at his sneakers
Played out of style out of rhymes
He's out his mind
Lost his way lost his pay
I'm takin' his props so call the cops
You can call 'em but I know 'em
Sweet MCs I think I'll ho 'em
'Cause they front so very hard and big or small
I'll break 'em all
Ain't gotta say that I'm the best
My skills will show I passed the test
When it comes to beats and rhymes
We come correctly every time
And stay tuned
Stay tuned...
Verse Two:
With information like the CNN
I can take you there and then
The rest is up to you to choose
The bottom line is win or lose
Suckers suckers suckers don't be listening
So I can't be waitin' on 'em
I ain't got no time to play, do you?
Look at the state of things and tell me true
In the city any city life's a paradox of good and evil
Many fall into the vicious cycle
Living by the gun or by the rifle
Think they got a reason that ain't really sure
The death toll rises more
It's trife the way some live life
I love rap, I like the city
But for a fool I have no pity
There'stoo much suffering too much struggle
Too much injustice and don't it bug you
Enough for you to press on harder
Against the odds the wayn our forefathers
Made away but foolishly we go astray
Think about it and stay tuned
Verse Three:
What you really oughta do is lay back smooth
As my vocals compliment the slow fat groove
Just for you to blast around the way
Play it nice and loud and hear me say
Gang Starr is hitting '92 and on
Showing how to make a dope rap song
Doing this while some disperse
Then dissolve like specs of dirt
Our music pertains to those who remain
Down with the real not wealth or the fame
Peace out, we'll be back, stay tuned...
Please stay tuned"

Gettin' beat to a pulp so that you can't run for help
I heard a gulp in your throat, cause you hope that I'll be merciful
But coo-cluck, I made you strut as I rehearse a few
Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill

Struck by a blow, from a mic gladiator

116,Street Ministry,1991,Step In The Arena (1991),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Presenting you with alternative music
'Cause, yo, the struggle is tough, and we must learn to live through it
Pleasure and pain, pain and pleasure
We gotta maintain a balance to obtain the treasure
Not really preaching or teaching but just reaching
Out to a brother or sister who is keeping
The faith and trying hard to get straight
The time is crucial so I think we must congregate
Let's have a meeting of the minds
Before we all fall and get left far behind
Finding a way is important
Map out a plan, take a stand, you can work it
The future's all in your hands and
So of yourself, yea, you should be demanding
We're all responsible for whatever outcome
That's why I speak over beats for my income
Knowledge is key and if you ask what it is, G
It's just a form of my style of street ministry
Street ministry..."
117,Suckas Need Bodyguards,1994,Hard To Earn (1994),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"MC's be fakin' so now they get taken
Fake MC's, they always act hard
But won't walk the street without their bodyguard
I hate fake MC's, they always act hard
But won't walk the street without their bodyguard
Verse One:
MC's I lay out like stiffs in the morgue
Praise the lord you're in awe when I'm gripping my mic cord
Rhymes I rip with swift execution
One verse could coerce your girl to prostitution
The Guru is now the brother that you fear and
Beware when I'm making hits with Premier and
Rolling to a spot near you, lyrics tear through
Chrome to your dome you better watch your rear view
Niggas been held back too long we're coming up
In the streets we roll alone so watch me running up
I'm summing up a mad posse of warriors
Night crusaders able to break down barriers
And bringing faces of death putting MC's to rest
Until there's no fake chumps left
Run. Step. Yeah, bounce nigga, bounce
My rhyme's a cargo when yours is just a quarter ounce
Verse Two:
Gangstarr boy and that's beyond your comprehension
Mad brothers in every city you can feel the tension
To stop the killing wack MC's must die
Who am I? I'm the substance that'll make your third eye cry
Too potent, too high in intelligence quotient
When I unleash my speech I'll have you punk rappers open
I won't expose your names and your identities
You know you're phoney get the fuck from in front of me
Hardcore fans are fed up from your folklore
Lines strip you raw and infect you like cold sores
And I hope you're not the one that I'm after
Since the days of Adidas I've been a true master
Verse Three:
I've been around, punk. But yo, I still feel young
A few of my crew members like to pack guns
I'm high strung but don't mistake me when I smile
I murder an entire rap chart with my freestyle
After the killing just like Casper; I'm ghost
Fakes thought I was friendly, at their wakes I was host
Toast without a gun you'd be done
Throw up your hands bitch and now you know you stand to lose one
Choose one metaphor and then choose another
Wax that ass like a bully have you calling your big brother
Although I'm five foot eight they call me sergeant
Got more hoes in my dick than you can fit in the garden
At Madison Square I shot a fair one
So many niggaz knew me that the kid wouldn't dare run
MC's pay cash to ensure their safety
They know they can't take me; the G-A-N-G, you crazy?
I be on them like a message from god
Knowledge of self while fake MC's play hard
Fake MC's they always act hard
I'm not a sucker so I don't need a bodyguard"

(Cut up 4X by DJ Premier)
(Guru)
Well goodness gracious, let me just take this
Time out to pull a rhyme out, and update this
For you and yours, simply because
Some MC's have luck but suck
So I pluck 'em like feathers on the back of a chicken
'Cause I'm mad like a pit when my man says, ""sick 'em""
Positive is the mindstate, but it could still mean that
I will kick a ill, malicious like mean rap
Suckers they forced me, to knock 'em all out and
They think they know things, like what I'm about and
They try to analyze criticize scandalize
The outcome is death, don't ask me to sympathize
Realize, that I'm not to be played with
I'll flip so fast, you won't know I'm the same kid
I'm tired and fed, with all the weak stuff said
All the phony-baloney, that went out like Pro-Keds
You've got no leads, so you shoot blanks
It's me the crowd thanks as I step to the top ranks
Bankin my money, and investin it wisely
Snatchin up chumps when they try to sneak by me
I'm the dominant one, call me the prominent one
And as I'm speakin' I'll be bombin the dumb
Deaf and blind 'cause I was born with a sharp mind
Eatin MC's with ease like it's lunchtime
Or crunchtime, when they get done without warning
I'll bust that butt from nighttime till morning
Your song's boring, and so I'm scoring
Much points 'cause when it's time to throw joints
I cause havoc, the mic I grab is like savage
I invade the stage, and make you get off
The force is like a three-eight, blowin' your head off
And that's just in case you might be wearin a vest
'Cause you're simply a pest in this mess I suggest you
""Take a rest""

Don't ever sleep son, peep one or two of these lines here
Arranged by a great brain, delivering rhymes clear
And concise with a nice dope voice and
Killin' the fakes like a taste of some poison
Punks are thinkin' they're alla that, their voices are all flat
They're findin their names, in a Wack Rapper's Almanac
Me follow that hollow crap, no way Jose
I'll seek out a better sound, to somethin' Premier plays
Days will go by, and soon you'll know why
MC's like me will rise like the Enterprise
Starship, headin straight for the target
Destination, a place where no perpetration
Is permitted, the Guru is with it to explain
How some MC's are scared to ride on a Four train
Or any other train in the city, for that matter
Playin' a role that they stole like a batter
But I know they ain't so I'll paint the real picture
My vocals go solo and like a bolo I'll hitcha
Square in your face I'll crack your ribs and your chest
Cause you thought your off-brand jam was the best
You fessed cause you guessed people would be impressed
I'm gonna bust that bubble on the double ""take a rest""
(DJ Premier cuts ""take a rest"" for the chorus)
(Guru)
Sit back and reflect, ponder and chill out
Rhymes like daggers make blood spill out
But you can't blame me, for bringin' disaster
With all these ducks, claimin that they're the masters
Only thing they mastered, is how to get wacker
As I roll uphill, they roll downhill faster
Now they're wondering how they lost their touch
Wanna buy my rhymes but mine cost too much
I'm the innovative one, call me the creative one
And I won't stop till the job is done
All the slobs just run when I come to get some
'Cause they know better, than to challenge this go-getter
They get bust you can trust 'cause I won't let a
Booty-ass rapper get wins against me?
I guarantee that I won't act friendly
Cause crabs have a nerve and deserve to get whipped on
Their girls get kissed on, while they get flipped on
I slaughter and slay, or slap 'em up quick
Cause the lyrics they kick make me seriously sick
No substance, no value, but nevertheless
They're gettin' daytime play but I still say they should ""take a rest""

We got at least five head so I rolled a white owl
It's the break of dawn and we're awake like night owls
Phillies are cool but they burn much quicker...
... Hey yo come on pass that shit nigga
We lounge to the sounds as we leave from Uptown
It's time to go downtown and make some more rounds
This city never sleeps that what Sinatra sang
For that fat fat blunt you know I got this thing
So hand it over 'cause I wanna get charred
I'm in love with mary jane she keeps me large
So don't hog it let's get it moving real fast
Everybody just chill and take like two pulls and pass
The club is crowded everyone's up in here
Heyo Premier what's that you got there?
It looks like a nice plump blunt in your hand
I just know you're gonna share it with me 'cause I'm your man
So bust it, I got one too and if you spark up yours
I'll light up mine when it's through
Oh shit, there goes my man the fat mack
We used to get blazed I know he's got a fat sack
Let's go upstairs grab a chair and unwind
So the la la can enhance our minds
The system booming let the bass increase
I find me a seat so I can peep the chic
Ladies and maybe get my homeboys some ass
All you gotta do is take two pulls and pass
Even in the morning like the flavor of juice
A blunt adds spice and a blunt can spruce
Up your day but I'm not advertising just telling
Of aspect a part of our lives
And around the way there ain't no shame in our game
Cause the fame is no thing we get together and hang
And since you know I got dash and class
Then I'm after you so take two pulls and pass"

The question remains... which MC's will reign
Which ones will gain, how many suckers will feel pain
""Ask yourself the same question""
""What is it..""
(Guru)
Phrases I spit like slugs after I sip from my mug
Life is bugged, the bassline groove is my drug
Now that you feel me, yo here's some advice
All you foul niggas gonna pay the fucking price
So take that phony hardcore look off your grill
'Cause I be stomping ya still with the intent to kill
This is a battle rhyme in case you haven't noticed
You get replaced you get demoted
I give chumps cranium lumps just like Louisville
I stand tall, just like the Catskill Mountains
Preying like a cougar ready to pounce and
Denouncing, all the unrealistic fake gangsters
Fake mystics; so let me make this specific
You know we're nearest the original gifted
Rhymes get twisted, brain cells dissolve
As the world revolves, wack crews lick my balls
They can't deal with the realism
When they go for the mic, they better bring their steel with them
They're gonna need crazy help
When I get down for mine, murdering suckers for delf
""Ask yourself the same question""
""What is it..""
The question remains... which MC's will reign
Which ones will gain, how many suckers will feel pain
""Ask yourself the same question""
""What is it..""
(Guru)
So umm... ""THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY!""
My sight is never blurry, I hit you with the flurry
Of rhymes and laws, combined with raw style and grace
You're just a pile of waste if you can't place in this rap race
I've been here, I'm staying, what, think I'm playing?
I've been down, I came up, the hard way, I'm saying
Bless my Pops he's divine
But what he owns is his and what's mine is mine
So God bless the child in the streets that's wild
I can easily pull a perping MC's file
You can study for years and be the world's top scholar
Out here, life's a gamble, people scramble for dollars
With the textbook sense, you can still be dense
Rather master the game than dwell in sorrow and shame
I'm a survivor, so I'ma always remain
The little nigga with the voice to leave a stain on your brain
""Ask yourself the same question""
...
The question remains... which MC's will reign
Which ones will gain, how many suckers will feel pain
""Ask yourself the same question""
""What is it..""
The question remains... which MC's will reign
Which ones will gain, how many suckers will feel pain
""Ask yourself the same question""
""What is it..""

My microphone is calling
So I'm one-two checking and yes yes y'alling
Fallen heroes are zeroes, I ain't down with the weirdos
I'm true to the game, fuck fame, peep my concerto
And yeah though I walk through the valley from Brooklyn to Cali
Huh, I leave the real niggas rallied
'Cause I ain't faking no jax, MC's are taken aback
Cause the songs they be making crazy wack
So I subtract them, I'm one ill black man
I pack man, liable to cap when I'm rapping
So all that's left is the bloodstains
But still the question remains
""Ask yourself the same question""
""What is it..""
The question remains... which MC's will reign
Which ones will gain, how many suckers will feel pain
""Ask yourself the same question""

126,The Illest Brother,1992,Daily Operation (1992),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
It takes the illest brother just to get respect
Got to be the illest brother when it's time to get wreck
Got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check
I'm one of the illest brothers known to man
But if you don't understand, see I'm a grown man
And I stand 5'8"" and 3 quarters
Giving orders to my sqaudron 'cause I'm like the sergeant
Or general but let me keep this minimal
I used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife
Cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
And like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped
Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so I gave it some thought
Remembering the brothers who are gone now
I will make a strong vow to make things right
Ignite the mic, get hype and all that
Suckers try to menace but they always fall
Flat to the ground as I astound come around
I'll put you down about the brothers who think they're the boss
Think they're getting large but in the end they pay the cost
Of their lives and that ain't the way to go out
Even take their boys with 'em 'cause they know their boys will go out
But when it comes to facing some time
They're like crying like weeping, wanna call mom Dukes
But mom Dukes is fed, fed up with the shit you did
She knows that you shot and she knows that you cripples kids
But who's to judge when you're trying to survive
The one who moves first might be the one to stay alive
So when you think you're hard and dominating the set
Just remember the illest brother claims respect!
Like I said I'm an ill kid, so never dare test me
They wanna arrest me 'cause I'm causing a frenzy
Fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
Real gangsters chill 'cause real gangsters know
That quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
'Cause too much talk will get you beef on the street
And brothers in the city have to live this way
It may cause dismay but Imma' tell it anyway
Yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet
Some young kid is gonna be the subject of internal oppression
An example of hard times
'Cause to make it out the trap in your mind it's a hard climb
But even if you change and come right and exact
There's another brother scheming so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a down fall
He'd pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn't give a damn if he killed somebody
'Cause if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot
There'd be no hesitation he'd just shoot
It's like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
Except it's reality and you don't see it on TV
Brothers keep dying in the streets 'cause the streets are designed
To keep you from having peace of mind
I know an old man, he's got a rifle to stifle
Any young punk, he hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who's been to jail
And he told me that the system had failed him
So now he's out the joint and he's like flippin' on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin' their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there's a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I'm meaning
'Cause rather than being the herb, vic, or chump
You can be just like my man cold holding the pump
But living like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life, sometimes will make you uptight
I'm like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools
All fakes, all snakes
And ones who try to break the rules and regulations
Stipulations made by the GangStarr
You try to flex muscle but you know you can't hang ha
You're making me vexed but yeah you can go next
Just remember the illest brother claims respect
Chorus repeat
Yo money don't front you know you blew your chance
And now it's my turn so Imma' take command
'Cause I'm like the one who's got all the juice
I always get loose I got the balls to reduce your crew
Very easily I got more ammo
I'm like the ill kid the psycho man yo
'Cause now I'm past the point and I ain't gonna return
And when it comes to your destruction I ain't really concerned
About the consequences 'cause I'm living day to day
So who are you to comment about me and my ways.
I get my attitude from living and I never forget
You got to be the illest brother just to claim respect!"

Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X
Make money money -- GO SHOPPIN'!
Take money money -- GO SHOPPIN'!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin' it... ""at the mall""
(G-Dep)
Yo what the deal cousin, gave him a pound now we huggin
In the mall thuggin', buggin, spent a few hundred
Shorties must be lovin', shit, jigg to my Wallow's
They watch like Movado so I floss like I'm lotto
You ain't loungin, till you've been countin' by the thousands
Profilin, pushin more weight than your medallion
We be wildin, lockin blocks down just like the Island
Dough pilin, we keeps it in the family like Italians
Ballin, cop some Charles Jordan and some icebergs
Ice herbs, nice curves, girlfriend with the white fur
Pushed up, feel her like some shots of Tequila
Said her man's a dealer, with all these bags from Antilla
He got to be, but you hot to me, you under lock and key?
Laid it down properly, this cat at Stern's watchin me
Moved on me sloppily, prepare for the fallout
With gats to blow the wall out, clear the mall out
(Shiggy Sha)
Yo, don't be mad at me, I used to be
King Raggedy, fiends naggin me, shit I had to breathe
Gradually, rocked casually, Sha passed the leave
Vaseline slick shit, green stick shit
Honey got some mean lipstick, my knot's this thick
And I cop the meanest shit, still ride DISCUS
But cops frisk us, the block whispers
Theft need to stop, how we cop
But you can Guess like them jeans you rock
For now I'm rollin' right, 'cause I had four faces
Fightin four cases in North Face of Dolemite
So if he's here I ace the toners out my holdin' tight
Shorty lookin' innocent there, in Benetton gear
Nuttin innocent here, this ?henneson gear?
Give us a year, to really see clear, through these Cartiers
And do it party yeah is what I'll probably hear
Sharkskin is what I'll probably wear, designed by Pierre, trust me
And look lovely with it
Cop a 4.2 and get ugly with it, snugly fitted, ruggedly hittin
Fitted in my Coogi knitted, compliments on the doobie did it
Got the movie rented if the crew be with it yo
(Guru)
Most times I'm casual, but easily I switch
To some fly shit, like some silk suits by Paul Smith
And purchase some kicks by Kenneth Cole
Cop a Hilfiger, or Polo goose, for when it's cold
Armani, and Gaultier specs cover my eyes
The definition of jiggy so you best to recognize
At the mall, I'm baggin up, much more than gear
Victoria, be whisperin mad Secrets in my ear
She wanted me to knock her in the back of Foot Locker
I chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer
Others try to copy, I see 'em when they mock me
Baseball cap bent, the fresh scent is Issey Miyake
All the way from Green Acre's to the Beverly Center
Heads turn, and I'm the main concern when I enter
At Albee Square, niggaz wouldn't even dare
With that fake thuggish ruggish when them Brooklyn kids be in there
Saw ?newriqi L? and then a sweet for my girl
Stylin, on the cell phone smilin', it's my world
Can't forget the Avorex, pocket for the royalty checks
My crew be showin loyalty, plus utmost respect
Yo son, go pioneer them bimbos, while I get some Timbo's
Later on that night you'll find them nymphos
That's how it goes cause mad heads be in the mall
Let's breeze, we got a show, plus I got another phone call"
128,The Meaning Of The Name,1991,Step In The Arena (1991),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"The meaning of the name GangStarr, well I'll tell ya
It means I find my mind can excel to
A greater type of thought, brought by the things that I've been taught
In relation to things that I rebel to divine and combine
With a sense of confidence
Accomplishments, are achieved off lots of gifts
But slopiness, I could never tolerate it
Not the Guru nor Premier you don't know how long we've waited
While other groups have faded, just like haircuts
We use sheer guts to open the earducts of your brain
To expose every vain
Cause you sound plain, insane, and mundane, it's a shame
You've got no beats, so you get no seats
At this table, you ain't stable with the mic cable
Kane and Able, jealous brothers
And I knew some girls who were overzealous lovers
But back to the act of developing the GangStarr track
It means that nothing can be wack
The music is picked right, the mic is gripped tight
The lyrics I kick right to a beat like Kryptonite power
Not withstood by any mortal or immortal
To make you get on the floor till
Another dope jam we slam with precision
Bringing beams of light, like the colors in a prism
Or reflections, through a spectrum
And all the soft silly suckers I'ma wet them
In other words destroy boy, and then claim my fame...
This is the meaning of the name
(DJ Premier cuts ""what does it all mean?"")
(Guru)
GangStarr, it means a lot to me
It means I'm free to bust rhymes sporadically
Gang represents my boys or a posse
So just back up off me
And the Starr symbolizes the power
Making the suckers and weak brothers cower
We got strong, intelligent minds with a street sense
Crazy offense, and stupid defense
Now, have I made myself clear?
Or do I have to call on DJ Premier?
For he and I make up the songs that you long for
Meanwhile ducks just knock on the wrong door
Waiting for a call or for the doors to open
'Cause they're hoping, that they'll get chosen
But to be chosen is a divine gift
You better get a job quick
See you can't rhyme and all your beats are weak
You oughta take a peak and check out the technique
Seek, and you shall find
GangStarr stands for mastermind
Simple and plain and yo this ain't no game lame...
This is the meaning of the name

If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin' name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's all right, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
With the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
Or we'll start the wettin up

It's The Militia *echoes*
Verse Two: Guru
Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, till everybody knows
That I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
Till I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send 'em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
That I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia
Verse Three: Freddie Foxxx
You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is butter baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
Of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect *gun clicks* you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best *UTFO sample* bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools
It's the Militia"

Till I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send 'em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
That I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia
Verse Three: Freddie Foxxx
You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is butter baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
Of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect *gun clicks* you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best *UTFO sample* bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools

""There's a bulletin - state police, Princeton Junction""
""The militia...
Certain individuals of unidentified nature
Is now under complete control""
""Hip-hop is not, what it is today..""
""It's the real *echoes*... it's the (militia)""
Verse one: Big Shug
If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin' name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's all right, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
With the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
Or we'll start the wettin up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you
Big Shug, Guru, Freddie Foxxx, The Militia, militia
Chorus: Freddie Foxxx
Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia *echoes*
Verse Two: Guru
Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, till everybody knows
That I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
Till I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send 'em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin

(Guru)
This is a conquest, so I suggest you take a rest
Or keep a breath, but definitely keep a vest on that chest
Rymes I'm packin, just like a thug at a car-jackin'
Shoot off your hat when I start cappin, this is no actin'
G-A-N-G, S-T-A double R
And you don't want no trouble up in here, baby pa
From the late-night drama, of the New York streets
To the hoods of LA, real niggas likin Primo's beats
Put suckers on glass, send em, back to class
And kick hot shit, so we can stack the Johnny Cash
I brought the God, Rakim, lyrically gunning you wanna dash?
I got Dub C, from South C, what you doubt me?
Travellin through warzones with my infrared microphone
In the year One Mill, destroying, enemies chromozones
Words burn through flesh, leavin' nothing but skeletal
You best pay resepect to the legends, boy I'm tellin' you, Militia
""The illest"" ""Realest"" ""Representin""
""Bringin' the rukkus"" ""Let it be known""
""The illest"" ""Realest"" ""Word up""

Makin' a move, makin' a move, who's that nigga that's makin' a move?
It's the Shadiest rhymin'-back, actin' a motherfucking fool
Four-four packers, my jackets ?hittin the tag? saggin, baggin
Foot on my rag, mess up a bag, leavin' my enemies in bodybags
You niggas was crackin', what y'all thought it wasn't gon' happen?
Dub C and my East Coast sisters gettin' together rappin'
Gun-clappin, chump smackin, kiss the ring of your highness
Look while I'm in New York City,
Walkin' with two of the Brooklyn's finest
My two affiliates from the East we all bang
But if y'all don't mind, this is still Westside Connec' Gang
Dress-code the same, just new pieces on my neck
East Coast brownies, house shoes, and hair nets
Y'all can't see this, so peep the sister G is pushin a Six

It's Dub C the jankiest loc', I'm runnin' this here

Yo, it's The Master, mister, Musical Massacre
Passion for disaster, paragraph ambassador
R get the red carpet, just call me on
Corner the market like the mic's last name was Corleone
The facade killer, come through your city like Godzilla
Think of the sickest thing you ever seen, Ra's iller
My vision's vicious, suspect suspicious
Plans is ambitious, my motive's malicious
No interferin, if you ain't down, you got to swearin
And these cats they ain't carin, habitat awarin
Crack appearin, from out the track that I'm hearin
It's either that, or I'm going back to racketeering
Yo, you should see me, I got a crew like Mussolini
But Kool as Moe Dee, my flow be, smooth and easy
For turnin' ?area centers? to wilers, you get the picture?
Rakim is, the minist', with malice, Militia

Got you quiddear and ski-dared, fearin what we might do
And you can give me all mine in cash, that will suffice dude
In the streets deep, we roll through the city
Looks like it's time to eat, so yo who's with me?
Strictly, we keep it in the best perspective
Cause nowadays it's more than simply live and let live
A sedative, that's what these headcases need
Them rats'll get trapped soon as they taste the cheese
Black M. Casey fan, just pay us and scram
Watch us drop a new supply to up the daily demand
Phony critics wanna retract shit, once I spit again
And since we didn't finish the job, you gettin' hit again

You fuck, you didn't listen when I told you before
When it comes to dope tracks, we be holdin' the raw
Do somethin' stupid, and you'll be left holdin' your jaw
Put you punks on blast for not knowin' the law
Don't deny yourself, learn to apply yourself
Or end up by yourself, I multiply the wealth
I got the titles, deeds, licenses and policies
Complete ownership, Don Gurizzu they call me
Primo said that we should just, lock it all down
See the bigger picture, so we can profit all around
Now everybody's ridin' the dick, once I spit again

I be the owner of this style, owner of this talk, owner of this art
Peep the gully way that I walk
Many say that I rock, others hate but they jock
Now we racin the clock, po-po casin the spot
Call me greedy 'cause I feel like takin' a lot
Vindication, 'cause they be fabricatin a lot
From Cali to Canarsie, penthouse to the lobby
Roxbury to NC, Century Club to envy
Bout to take over the action, you know it's bout to happen
Cause our shit be hittin, and yours is plain ol'fashioned
I had no choice, but to spit again
GangStarr motherfucker, and you just got hit again

134,The Place Where We Dwell,1992,Daily Operation (1992),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Verse one:
New York, New york is where we live and we're thorough
Never taking shorts 'cause Brooklyn's the borough
Peace to Uptown, to queens and the Bronx
Long Island and Jersey get as fly as they want
Where we rest is no joke
So let me break it down to sections for you slowpokes
Fort Green, bedstuy, Flatbush, Brownsville
Crown Heights and East New York will be down till
Medina takes respect for the style's we bring
'Cause in Brooklyn, we be into our own thing
Alantic terminals, redhook bushwick
Come to Brooklyn frontin, and you'll get mushed quick
We ain't just know for flipping and turning out parties
But also for the take no bullshit hotties
On the subject of blackness, well let me share this
Brooklyn is the home for cultural awareness
So in all fairness, you can never compare this
Some good, some bad. little hope for the weak
Dangerous streets and Coney Island Beach
All this included when you go for a tour
Some can get scandolous and outright raw
When you step, step correct and watch where you move
We pay dues so we ain't trying to lose
Here in Brooklyn
The home of the black and the beautiful
For a ruffrap sound, ain't a place more suitable
Other cities claim this, and others claim that
But let me give some props to the place where we be at
B-R-double O- K-l-Y-N
I came in for a visit and ever since then
I've been incorporated with select personel
Right here in Brooklyn, the place where we dwell
Way down in Brooklyn (3x)
Those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talking about
Verse two:
Peace to Boston, Philly, Connecticut, DC
All the east coast cities are fly to me
Peace to everybody down south and out west
But for me, Brooklyn, New York is the best
Don't be afraid to venture over the bridge
Although you may run in to some wild ass kids
Take the j train, the d or the a if you dare
And the 2,3,4,5 also comes here
There's so much to see 'cause Brooklyn's historic
Fools act jealous but you have to ignore it
So I just lounge wit the fat clientel
Out here in Brooklyn, the place where we dwell
Way down in brooklyn
You know the place..."
135,The Planet,1994,Hard To Earn (1994),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"(Guru)
Boom bash dash, I had to break, I had to getaway
Packed my bags, to leave for good, it was a Monday
Kissed my mother, gave my pops a pound
Then he hugged me, and then he turned around
I threw the duffelbag over my shoulder
It was time to get props kid, cause now I'm older
Time to fend for myself jack
So I'ma go for mine, and maybe never come back
Stopped at the lye spot before I hit the train station
Needed some boom for the mental relaxation
It took the last of my loot to make this move Troop
But I ain't even tryin' to work in a suit
Plus my aunt's got a room that's for rent
As long as there's no hoes and I don't come home bent
So fuck the bullshit I'm audi
I'm on a mission, 'cause if I stay I'll go crazy
I'm gonna make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
They never fake it just slam it
Out in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
Crash boom bang I used to hang at Four Corners
And all the spots in Beantown where niggaz carry burners
But I was more turned on by the micraphone
So one cold morning, I left home
Next I'm smokin' blunts on?
Or workin in a mail room Uptown, feelin' sick and
Tired, of payin' all these fucked up dues
I wasn't tryin' to lose -- I refused
Had a chick Uptown, one in Queens and one in Jersey
Sometimes all you need to get by, is a girlie
But yo I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block, happen nightly
East New York is no joke kid
And peace to my man Hass doin' his bad
I went to Flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin' to read
That shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
And like the sayin' goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart there ain't no quittin
So I stayed up late, to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin
But fuckit I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin
See I'ma make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I'll never fake it just slam it
There in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
And you can, walk the walk talk the talk but don't flaunt
Cause little shorty's scheamin on your rings and fronts
But don't sweat it, cause that's the life out here
A lot of niggaz, be livin' real trife out here
I got my own place in Bed-Stuy
Known to many others, as Do or Die
Malcolm X Boulevard and Gates Avenue
Smokin' up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggaz Troy and Squeaky
Used to twist Dutch Masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut had to go to Fort Greene
On Myrtle Ave, to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to Fulton just to look around
Just to roam around, and find a chick to go Uptown
And check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, 'cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin' out bein no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to Red and Marley, wishin I was on kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank 40's with Tommy, Hill and Gunsmoke
And Lil' Dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a L 'cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin every night
But I'ma be aight still
'Cause I'ma keep writin shit and perfectin my skills
I'm gonna make it god damnit
Here in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I never fake it just slam it
Here in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet *echoes*"
136,The Rep Grows Bigga,1998,Moment Of Truth (1998),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"You do your first bid and dirt to get your name known
You never talk too much to get your spot blown
Now you're no longer just a face in the crowd
You're gettin' so much respect that niggaz might as well bow
And movin up with your hustle like you planned it
Rakin dough like the world's greatest bandit
Always got one eye open, for the stick-up kids postin
So much cream chumps they can't understand it
Ladies flock to your jock like it's golden
Curious, to test the weight you be holdin'
But you ain't got no time, to be chasin felines
If she's the chick that you pick then she gets chosen
People treat you like you're ghetto royalty
And all your staff shows you utmost loyalty
You paid your dues, refuse to lose in this scenario
The rep grows bigga, you're a legend and a hero
Your fame has gotten larger than your life
You've got a harem of bitches and killer niggaz that's hype
They got your back, but you so fly you don't need em
You shit what you're eatin so you don't peep the proceedings
They start schemeing, feeling that you're too swollen
And that's the reason why your cash and stash gets stolen
You start perspiring, because you're paranoid
Still another confrontation that you couldn't avoid
Prepare for drama, as if you were a stunt man
Back in the days you was a forty and a blunt man
Today you're a Willie, now the weather's too chilly
New York City ain't the place to be frontin
Over your shoulders day and night's where you look
Your so-called fam ran a scam, and you got shook
Go back to square one, better go talk to your son
See reps grow bigga in the life of a crook
Years ago, we were new jacks to this scene
Showed some effort, made fat records, but still saw no green
Know what I mean? They tried to stifle us
Nigga you could not believe how really ill and trife it was
Fed up so we headed on a serious mission
Wishin, that we could better our position
Two businessmen, Guru and Prim', we enterprised
Too strong to be stepped on, creatively wise
The dedicated ministers of underground sound
When we're doin' our thing, you know we don't fuck around
No matter how bizarre and different you think you are
Your team wouldn't dream of competeing with GangStarr
Premier in the rear with the beats and cuts
And Guru with the mic ready to tear shit up
Take us out the game nigga? How you figure?
The name is well kept, and the rep just gets bigga"

Want some shit that's fat catch a victim do a stick
Kids pulling triggers, niggas killing niggaz

The shit makes them feel like little big man
Twelve years old catching wreck

It's like you need to have steel just to feel relaxation
Tons o' guns"

(Preem') I'm sayin' man, who the fuck you think you are man?
(Smiley)
Yo, yo
Yo gangsta gangsta, O.G. is what you call me
It's like my life is like a never-endin drug story
Make coke, expand, yo you know who I am
Death percentages rises in the hood like grams
Who done it and ran, who blammed on my fam'
Out the window every night, deadly intentions man
Cocked back and ready to fire, hit man for hire
And fuck politicians, nothin' but liars
As I build my cream, with self esteem
But drink the water from the streams, of gangsta lean
To keep food on my plate, stick a mac to your face
So I never have to fall off, so you can never underrate
Force pressure, is the techniques of real men
So when you slam the doors, we still get in
It's like demons when, what you fight that you can't see'll
Come out your buildin, and get shot drastically
The way of the world, niggaz fiendin to pull it
You either bite the dust, or just dodge that bullet"
140,What I'm Here 4,1998,Moment Of Truth (1998),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"""Tell the people what you're here for""
Intro/Chorus: Guru
It's the message in the song that makes you rock on
Some people go to places where they don't belong
Whether wrong or right, a lot of people fight
But I'm here to bless this mic, aight?
Verse One: Guru
I take action the minute that the crowd gets hype
I'm type crashin, down like a meteorite
I'm Bogart-ing, mics and whole stages
Destroying MC's dreams, from words to whole pages
Their rapbooks, look more like scrapbooks
With their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin'
There's been enough beef, and enough gat clappin
There's been mad signs, for this brother to heed
And while some choose greed, I choose to plant seeds
For your mental, spirit and physical temple
Bob your head to it, there's the water you've been lead to it
Bathe in it, a long time you've been cravin it
Prance to it, use your third eye and glance through it
Your state of being, becoming advanced through it
While others rhyme with no reason I be breezin
Their mics I seize them, then I try 'em for treason
I used to always like to hang out
Now I lounge in the rest writin bombs while tracks bang out
I know you peeped me in the club then
But now I'm in your speaker, with the voice that you're lovin'
Verse Two: Guru
Peace to the young ladies, who wanna bone me much
And peace to my nigga Premier, with the golden touch
I never fall off point, like DeNiro in Casino
Peace to Black Gambinos and all my peoples
Dig the steelo -- I'm fightin wars you know
As in the Jihad, most humble, most merciful
That's because I be God, I trog through fogs, puffing logs
MC's muttering menial madness, they get mobbed
Scarred and barred, and then, banished from my fuckin' kingdom
You got a fly one bring one, or else I come to fling some
Exquisite exotic exciting type shit
Enough to make the real heads wake up and get hype quick
I'm type slick, known as the God Universal
Kick rhymes without rehearsal, I cross the burnin sands
Now I stand here with virtue, of course I could hurt you
Simply with my point of view, and I knew
That many would come, that's why I've chosen
To cut off pathways, and there's no runways or doorways open
For the jokers who ain't focused
And all the fake mercenaries get buried by the tongue of terrifying fury
Nothing's blurry, fuck it I got no worries
Hearts and minds, shine bright light with insight
Yeah sense my birthright to set up cyphers with power
Cause mad shit ain't right, like punks in the spotlight
Who can't freestyle, sometimes I make my peeps smile
By sayin' somethin' crazy wild
Like some shit off my dome, that be soundin
Better than the next man's whole album..."
141,What You Want This Time?,1991,Step In The Arena (1991),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"(Scratch: Telephone ringing)
""Who's this? Juanita? Fatima? Solika? Oh, it's Freda?
Look, I have a question, just what is it that you need
A man, a lover, maybe someone to talk to?
Or could it be you're schemin'? Oh, not you!
Well listen, I got this phone installed for business
And who gave you our number? Seriously, what is this?
The new fad? Now you wanna kick it to a rapper,
DJ or dancer? Well I don't have the
Time for no stunts, no hookers and no games
Our name and our fame is for the long way we came
The struggle, the hassle, the hustle, the fight
And you're asking me if you can see me tonight?
Don't you know the Guru's not the type to be out skeezin'
The reason is because I do believe in
Havin' the right to choose the one I want
And, if I had a girl, why would I front?
You're only gonna get your feelings hurt, miss
And truthfully I really don't wanna have to diss
My music means everything to me, it's my life
So make like a camper, and go take a hike
You can't mess with my mind, and don't tie up my line
You called yesterday, so what you want this time?""
""A-yo Premier (Yeah?) Who's that knockin' at the door?
(Yo man, it's Vicky) Vicky? Are you sure?
The one from down the block who was actin' all hot
She stops me all the time and says she likes me a lot?
How does she know where we live, I didn't tell her
And word is bond, duke, I'm not the fella
No matter what I say this young lady's persistent
For instance, she watches me from a distance
And if I walk by and I forget to say hi
She pushes up on me and rubs me with her thigh
I told her I was taken, but she doesn't care
A-yo, do me a favour, tell her I'm not here
Forget it, I think she heard my voice already
You can let her in, but I'm tryna cook spaghetti
Oh, hello, how you doin'? Who me? I'm fine
I don't mean to be rude, but... what you want this time?"""

An arrogant fuck, wave ""Hi"" when they watch me
Can't stop me every time official
Better find my residuals or this nine gon' lift you

Even if the old ladies love to call the cops
I got guns

You got, he got, they got
M dot, O dot, P my nigga we got guns
Big ones, extra large heat
Humongous shit that won't fit up under your car seat

Brownsville deep in my genes
I show you +bad boy+ for real, keep thinkin' shit is +Peaches and Cream+

Gun ya down, guns sing like blaow
Raise up cock pot my biscuit for my nigga O.G. had quick shit
We got guns

Crazy ill, man rowdy

Bringin' the noise, bringin' the funk, pop the lock

Nowadays my priorities ain't based on fun
I'm tryna cop some more property and in case of them guns
Sick society's got Guru protectin his fam
Fuck Prudential, I got my own protection plan
Respect me man, I'm on a mission so to speak
You're too dumb to play your position so unique
I'll trade 'way your meat faggot vacate the streets
GangStarr, First Fam, and TS, we way deep
And even if you had a thought to move on us
Our fire power will devour, bitch you'll chew on dust
Slow death, no rep, hollows have you gaspin
You rich just for you, he got a lavish casket
Call us savage bastards usin' all means necessary
It's only customary
It's you we got to bury
We'll dead your homo thug network
Head shots make your head jerk
My marks-men/man on the roof, he's an expert

Who got a problem? It's already been established
I'll come through your town with a pound like a savage
Still throwin' down on the grounds that I'm average
Can I hear for a gangster? Yeah NIGGA
It's always some shit but it's always a clip
To re-route your doubts and see what you about
Your homeboy's a snitch and your bossman's a bitch
We takin' over these bricks (IS THAT SO?)
Doin' underhanded shit, I'll shoot you in your abdomen
You fraud, you're movin like a broad with this faggot shit
And you deserve a hole
In the back of your motherfuckin head the doctor can't fix
On the concrete, we palm heat like soldiers

143,Who's Gonna Take The Weight?,1991,Step In The Arena (1991),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"""Knowledge is power, and knowledge can be the difference between life
Or death... you should know the truth and the truth shall set you
Free.""
I was raised like a Muslim
Prayin' to the East
Nature of my life relates rhymes I release
Like a cannon
'Cause I been plannin' to be rammin' what I wrote
Straight on a plate down your throat
So digest as I suggest we take a good look
At who's who while I'm readin' from my good book
And let's dig into every nook and every cranny
Set your mind free as I slam these thoughts
And just like a jammy goes pow [FX: Gunshots]
You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin'
'Cause things are gettin' crazy
You better stop being lazy
There's many people frontin'
And many brothers droppin'
All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
I've been through so much that I'm such
A maniac, but I still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so I break
On fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr
Guru with the mic and Premier raise the anchor
Swiftly, as we embark on a journey
I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions I made, 'cause now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there I got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?
The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind I find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less travelled
So I can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'
That's why I'm down with the Nation
Spirituality supports reality
We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours
This is the meaning of the chain and the star
Land is power, so gimme forty acres
Let's see how far I can take ya
Original invincible
That's how I'm lookin' at it
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
So let me ask you, is it too late?
Ayo, who's gonna take the weight"
144,Words From The Nutcracker,1994,Hard To Earn (1994),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"Sick thoughts on my mind with no self-control
Uplift your soul and make the brothers wanna roll
Sixteen years old with heart that's gold
Yo check it check it out like this, here we go
Run around the streets cold strapped like an alley rat
But now I'm gettin' much props like a fat cat
A young mack but I don't think I'm all that
I just can't sweat another brother's bozack
So what the fuck, y'all movin on up
Gonna swim in big bucks, like Scrooge McDuck
And if ya don't like and you wanna step up
Then open your mouth, and suck my nuts
Melachi the Nutcracker, I'm always gettin' blacker
Fatter, I bust a fat rhyme to make your head shatter
I'm from the Bronx, New York City
The big fuckin' Apple where the niggaz get busy
God bless the dead, and God rest my pops
Peace to the niggaz goin' out bustin' shots..."
145,Words I Manifest,1989,No More Mr. Nice Guy (1989),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Gang Starr,"I profess and I don't jest cause the words I manifest
They will take you, sedate you, and I will stress upon
You the need for, you all to feed your
Mind and soul, so you can lead your-self
To keep, I got a real objective here
I am effective here, 'cause I select a clear
Message to all, suckers I maul they fall from
Into the pit of purgatory
I go for glory, I take an inventory
Countin' all the tough luck ducks while I narrate
Relate and equate, dictate and debate
My fate is to be, cold makin' history
I use sincerity, but I'm so very deep
Doubts are questions, of all the skeptics
I'm kickin clout and, I'll leave you vexed
It's just true, there's nothing so-so 'cause I know
Right about to spin it I'm in it admit it I did it
To you, cause this is what I'm into
So chill while I instill that we all must fulfill
The proper mission for us and yo this is a must
It's usually lines of my rhymes I ingest
These are the words that I manifest, I manifest
I suggest you take a breath for the words I manifest
They will scold you and mold you, while I impress upon
You the fact that, I use my tact at
Rhymin for climbin, and chill while I attract that
Girl you're with, I got a sincere quality
I give her all of me, 'cause you're too small to be
Tryin' to riff, so let me uplift and shift my gift
Let's go to the fullest capacity
I got tenacity, because I have to be
The brother who must live and give with much insight
Foresight to ignite, excite and delight
And you might gain from it, or feel pain from it
Because I'm ultimate, and I'm about to let off
Knowledge is wisdom, understanding
Truth's the proof, so won't you throw a hand
In the air, put up a peace sign and be fine
If so we're feeling good we should we could we would
Stop, think for a moment OK?
And then sway while I convey that we must do away
With all the stress and the strife, so god bless your life
Use kindness, and never blindness
And you will find that this perspective is best, check it out
These are the words that I manifest, I manifest
I convey that what I say will awaken you today
After jockin while I'm talkin', but anyway
That you put it I give you, lyrics to live to
Righteousness rules, so I forgive you this time
For you are being very ignorant
That's insignificant, I guess you figured and
Hoped to be, dope as me, ID you flee
Because the rest is too much for you
I'm your professor, I got the touch to
Do more than the rest who fess and can't compete
I'm elite I'll defeat delete and mistreat
Make mincemeat of other fools, 'cause I'm the brother who'll
Snatch up the funds and, make lonely ones
I meant it really, 'cause I'm clearly obsessed and I
These are the words that I manifest, I manifest"

It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype

""Let 'em know, do your thing y'all"" ""Keep it live""
[Flavor Flav] ""To the beat y'all""
The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin the wax
I be bringin' salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin' more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin' grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo they must wanna fry, they can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
([Method Man] ""You know my steez"")
You know my steez...
""Let 'em know, do your thing y'all"" ""Keep it live""
[Method Man] ""You know my steez""

""The mic...""
On the microphone you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks, ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin' to be fly, ridin' high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes makin' fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn he flipped""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick -- why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder, than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas, yo
Them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon
Your song's, pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on
Word is bond... you know my stee"

(Premier) Yo, you all right man? ... You zonin?
{*Scratched: ""I... I speak that..""*}
(Premier) what's the deal?
{*Scratched: ""I speak that re-real shit, just listen""*}
(Verse One: Guru)
Yo I pop your lid, I got to live
I ain't tall but I can show y'all what a problem is
I like to zone, I'm nice with chrome
I keep a vast stash of Magnums 'cause I like to bone
I play the game, I stay the same
But I can switch styles, pick files, I'm like gravy train
Shot the witness, got the bitches
Still in the streets with my heat about to shock the business
I handle biz, I cancel kids
Just like Allen I'ma show 'em what ""The Answer"" is
I'm after props, I spaz a lot
And yo I'm deadin all the bullshit till my casket drops
You know me boy, you owe me boy
You wanna end up in my trunk dyin' slowly boy?
I'm confident, I'm on some shit
'Cause I been knowin' already you was on the dick
I'm zonin
(Chorus: DJ Premier scratching - repeat 2X)
""Down with the Foundation""
""Step into my zone, mad rhymes'll stifle ya"" -> Guru
""No time for games 'cause I'm, all grown up"" -> DMX
""I speak that re-real shit, just listen""
(Verse Two: Guru)
It's conspiracy, you hearin me? That's why I get love
And still got others fearin me
You never know, who's next to blow
And since it's me, I'ma stash me some extra dough
Got extra flow, chicks give me sex and dough
Need I, mention P.I. player let me know
I'm down with dis, I founded this
So you should recognize the true authentic sound of this
The golden voice, holdin' toys
But not playin', Guru and Preem', we like the golden boys
The chain and star, I'm angry pah
Cause you fucks ain't wanna give us what we aimin for
You stupid son, I shoot my gun
From the heart fool, you know that's where this music from
Protect your dome, respect the throne
This is Guru and Premier, and you can bet it's on
I'm zonin"
