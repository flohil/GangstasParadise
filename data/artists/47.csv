1,And Ya Don't Stop,1994,Regulate...G-Funk Era (1994),,Warren G,"For 94, I'm a just glide and swerve
Hop up the streets with my heats so observe
It's me Z the whee Z, the Warren to the G Z
The deuces and the treys as kickin it through E-Z
And the beach and the bottle where I'm found
Fuckin' around with the muthafuckin Dogg Pound
Fuck it, Warren's goin' wild
The G Funk Era and the muthafuckin G Child
Funk, melody, rhythm, base
He which is I is in the muthafuckin place
So let me get away, come again like this

Rat tat tat tat diddy dum diddy dum
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit
And ya don't stop, and ya don't quit
Well let me grab my stick and shift to first
I'm spittin' plenty game on my second verse
Well let me switch to second just for the rough ride
L-O-N-G-B-E-A-C-H Eastside
Where the grass is greener, at some times
And I don't do shit but drop funky rhymes
Now I'm in neutral, shifting to third
'Cause what you hear is what you heard, nigga
From the G-Funk, G-Funk, 'cause we funk, we funk
And if you step muthafucka you get stomped
Like 1, 2, 3 I'm shiftin to the fo
But you don't hear me doe
I said humpty dumpty sat on the wall
I guess its time for me to sum it up for all
G Funk, G Child, gangsta groove, locc
Past tense it's the Indo smoke
Choke, off the shit that I'm doin'
I'm droppin' this shit for you and you and you and

1, 2 buckle my shoe,
3, 4 we gotta hit the store,
5, 6 back in the mix,
7, 8 Warren G and Nate,
Nate Dogg-
Bang to the boogy say up jump the boogy
To the rhythm of the boogidy beat
I don't love no hoes they know so they don't be fuckin' wit me
Warren G-
A long time ago I met Annie Mae
She was killing me softly like everyday
Penetentiary steel, was stickin for real
Blockbustin through the walls
Now I'm makin' housecalls
Nate Dogg-
I thought I'd met a lot of scandalous women, and then I met Annie Mae
Kinda thin light skinned big butt (yes y'all)
But she didn't have a place to stay
Warren G-
She was shackin at mine and shackin at his
Blowin' my socks, tellin' his biz
Nate Dogg this and Nate Dogg that
213 skirt, and we stay intact
So I told the homey Nate don't be mislead
Ain't no fun if the homey can't shake a leg
So I went to the house and knocked on the door
And guess who it was, Annie Mae you H-O
I once knew a trick named Annie Mae (ooh)
(I once met a bitch named Annie Mae) (Snoop Dogg)
I once knew a trick named Annie Mae (ooh)
I once knew a trick named Annie Mae
Nate Dogg-
Remember yesterday I asked you baby have I seen you somewhere before
With just one look, the pussy was took
'Cause I make music that you adore
Now I'm not sure and I might be trippin'
But in 94 I heard a song
It ain't no fun unless the homies can come
So Warren G put a condom on
Warren G-
Now Nate you know me and I know you
I got rubbers, gin and socco (?) too
So let's do the do, on how we do,
Never my boo, just a freak that I knew
Warren G-
Annie Mae, Annie Mae, you ran out of time
Warren G and Nate Dogg blew your mind
'Cause if you trickin wit him
You trickin wit me, you trickin wit the 2 1 muthafuckin 3
I came from rags to riches
Trustin no snitches
That's how we do on 9 S I X bitches
Buck em, fuck em, and put 'em in the trash
And jump in the 600 Benz and dash
Nate Dogg-
Hold up Warren before you go just a couple things I got to say
Are you goin' home, I wanna be alone
You need to take this... hoe"
3,Back Up,1997,Take A Look Over Your Shoulder (1997),,Warren G,"(Now, now go)
You got me fucked up
(Why?)
'Cause I'm a bad muthafucka and you can't understand me
MCs don't know how we puts it down
K-9 and P-C from East to North town
We be bound by honor, or whoever wants to step
So either ya keep on steppin or we takes ya automatic weapon
(P-C)
Nigga back up, see I came to stack up
Bodies like hits, what's that
You wanted to act up, and diss the click
A sister, put my niggaz up wetted the grave
You wanted to get richer, so offer your beats that made by fade
Cascade, because yo ass is soapy
Mr. Locc you wanna be Mr. low key
When yo ass used to be low key
You know me so act like you know my click
And I'm an assist to kick the shit that you and MD could never get with
And speakin' of MD, another nigga that used to be from my click
Act like he double to down, but when it go down, go down he splits
This is strictly for all of y'all niggaz that diss me
Y'all think y'all skills is up to par well stars come out and get me
Now we got these niggaz out on the streets, and a place to lay my gun?
I guess you could say that I got hostess, in more ways than one
Y'all keep clickin and clickin, my chips continue to stack up?
But while you dissin and dissin I'm a tell you niggaz to back up 'cause

We be bound by honor, or whoever wants to step
So either ya keep on steppin or we takes ya automatic weapon
(K-9)
(Hey K-9 what about Mad Dog)
Well let that nigga loose
No better yet just let the dog loose
So he could fetch, goin' to Vegas to see what he catch
Ain't gonna be no cases
Just tell him what he faces and watch him snitch
While I lay up in Vegas
Its either the Raiders or the switch so he did
Switched over like electric shocks
Moms got on pregnant static
So they suspected pops
Did they know about me
Mr. K-9 see, clicksta in deep, in your Mama's panties
Did they know that I was bangin' it
Where at, oh your Daddy's bread be back
Now she's pregnant and I ain't claimin it
Your husband's cryin 'cause he feels like a chump
What, your son is fit to die and he ain't nothin' but a punk huh
She can't sayin' nothin' 'cause she needs my support?
But not for the child see the hooker's tryin' to take him to court
And I'm a body like Jah
But accept with mo mil
We probably wasmeant for each other
'Cause we two niggaz they gave us both jams
MCs don't know how we puts it down
K-9 and P-C from East to North town
We be bound by honor, or whoever wants to step
So either ya keep on steppin or we takes ya automatic weapon
So when the east is in the (when the north is in the house)
Back up, back up

4,Can You Feel It,1997,Take A Look Over Your Shoulder (1997),,Warren G,"Lbc d-e-f-g
I'm H-I off J's bellin in a T-shirt and blue jeans
Well few dreams ever come true
Well some do, so nigga say (I'm from the beach too)
Long Beach City G's Funkin
And it's a pity who many we's punk and drunk
In a hotel lobby at a town near you
Housekeeper's high, and drinkin' beer too
Cleared through the night
My niggaz movin with the skirts
In the boxes, houseshoes, and slingshot t-shirts
Its gettin' late, I'm runnin' out of gas
So Warren G tryin' to see what's up on some ass
Really doe, y'all enjoyed the show, good
But what you know about these Long Beach boys in the hood
Should anything go wrong and niggaz act shitty
Remember fool this is Long Beach city, punk
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Well it was boring until Warren G came on the scene
Put the G-Funk with the gangsta lean
It's been about 2, is he comin' through?
I dropped this one just to show you I'm true
People say Warren where'd you get that speech
In the sandy city right down by the beach
Speak, don't speak on, if you wanna speak on
If you wanna get yo groove on, LOC on
To the fullest, bounce rock skate,
A new time, a new rhyme, legislate
That's how we do it in the S-I-X
LBC, 213, and we straight shit at the next
So lets party hearty like Lodi Dodi
We punkin yo city you betta ask somebody
'Cause if you don't, we ain't showin no pity
More bounce to the ounce and we rockin' yo city
From city to city and state to state
This DJ gonna regulate
So playa hate if you want to, I don't give a fuck
I'm still G-dubb and I'm subbin in my truck so good luck
And have a nice trip
We got y'all town locked down like a vice grip
I'm on the dice tip, shootin C-notes
A dollar and the bones hollerin G-oats
'Cause we quotes, them gangsta raps
That y'all paid for, and we banks the snaps
We perhaps, if you could see what I see
Then you might be gettin' paid like this nigga Warren G
So fee, fie, foe, I'm from, the LB to the C nigga don't act dumb
Outta site, outta mind, so where y'all gonna put us
Warren G and the Twinz and my girls Five Footaz"
5,Do You See,1994,Regulate...G-Funk Era (1994),,Warren G,"The blues has always been totally American.
As American as apple pie ... as American as the blues
As American as apple pie, the question is why?
Why should the blues be so at home here?
Well, America provided the atmosphere
(You don't see what I see)
Everyday as Warren G. I take a look over my shoulder as I get older
Getting tired of mothers fuckers sayin' ""Warren I told ya.""
(You don't hear what I hear)
But it's so hard to live through these years with these funny bunny niggas,
Ain't shit changin'. Got my mama wonderin if I'm gang bangin'.
But I don't pay attention to these father figures. I just handle mine,
And I'm rollin' wit my niggas. Off to tha V I P, ya see, Snoop dogg and Warren G.
Unbeliveable as time just flies right before your eyes but you don't recognize.
Now whos the real victim? Can you answer that? The nigga that's jack
And all the fool getting jacked... yeah
(You don't see what I see)
Everyday as Warren G
(You don't hear what I hear)
But it's so hard to live through these years
(X 2)
Another sunny day.
Another bright blue sky.
Another day another mutha fucka die.
These are the things I went through when I was growing up.
There's only one hood a nigga should be throwin' up.
And I knew it, there really ain't nothing to it,
Thinkin' every fools gotta go through it.
Now lets go back, (how far?) back in time.
Drivin' to these hookers tryin' to mack for mine.
I remember when we all used to stop at the spot.
Back then my nigga name was Snoop rock. huh,
It's all so clear, '87, '88, then '89's tha year.
Ya say everywhere we roll, you can say we roll thick.
Way back then 2 1 3 was a clique.
Somethin' the state paid I was just a young haul,
Warren G, Snoop Rock, and Nate Dogg.
(You don't see what I see)
Everyday as Warren G
(You don't hear what I hear)
But it's so hard to live through these years
(X 2)
You make me holla,
Get out tha game, too many mutha fucka's know my name.
While Snoop Doggs servin' time up in Wayside,
I puts in down on the street, don't try to take my.
I had to re-ensure tha homie that he wasn't alone.
We talk, and him and Nate conversate on tha phone.
He kept sayin', ""Nigga it won't be long, B-4 a little skinny nigga like me'll be home.""
I said ""Snoop, thangs then changed. It's not the same, we need to get up out the game.
'Cause we can get paid in a different way with you kicken dope rhymes and I DJ.""
Well as time go passed, slowly we tried to make it.
But things are getting hectic, I just can't take it.
Should I A. Go back to slangin dope?
Or should I B. Maintain and try to cope?
Or should I C. Just get crazy and wild?
But no I chose D. Create the G child.
It's be on ever since with me and Mr. Grim,
This shit is getting so hectic that I can't even trust him now.
What would you do for a warren g cut?
Would act tha fool and nut the fuck up?
Back tha fuck up?
Act tha fuck up?
Niggas talk shit they get smacked tha fucked up.
Striaght up!
(You don't see what I see)
Everyday as Warren G
(You don't hear what I hear)
But it's so hard to live through these years

6,Dollars Make Sense,1999,I Want It All (1999),,Warren G,"(Feat. Kurupt and Crucial Conflict)
(Kurupt talking)
Y'all don't know nothin' about this HEE-ARE
Hahahahahahaha, yeah! It's Kurupt Young Gotti
Hehaha, sup Warren G? It's my homeboy, huh?
With my niggas Crucial Conflict, huh?
Chillin', huh? Bumpin, puffin on a little bit of that Hay
*TOKE* Ah
(Warren G)
Dollars make sense, it's all incorporated
I'ma get it all, since a BG I done did it all, was in it all
When I first thought I was in the wrong
Couple tokes, alcohol
Got everything I need, Hennessey and weed
Since my arrival, based on this modern-day survival
Ev'rything is technicality, everything based on reality
So how do I get paid, all these licks nowadays
They want me laid, dropped and plagued, AK mouth is sprayed
It's like I'm blind, and I just can't see
Warren G, I'ma holler at the homey Shorty B
""Shorty B IT'S ME!"", G Dove, I'm out to make a grip
So call Crucial Conflict and let's make us some bomb shit
(Wildstyle)
Look at me on the M-I-C
Tryin' to stack my tips, comin' in a big ole ride
With all that bumpin side, livin' up in your eyes, surprise
Hangin' on the corners where the young brothers be comin' up
The gangbangers be gunnin up, the type of brothers that roll with us
High tech with much respect, with all that G's swarmin
Like G-Funk in your eyes and make you see we about that cashflow
Put 'em in a lasso, don't try to sweat, no joke
We illa your side, in the back we get hot, trade bump and hit 'em up
With the jigs up,
Freaks from the West to the east to the South where they chief
Kurupt in the mind, Young Gotti down with the raw dog Flict
I ain't no tricks, nigga Wildstyle, enemies get closed down
We rock the shows, slammin' do's, Cali to Chi-town
(Coldhard)
So chop it up, I'm gonna kick some shit about what's goin' on
Have to get my loot up so I suit up
Looked in the mirror said to myself ""It's gon' be gone""
I'm sick of goin' through the things that I have to do do
Cops are happy to jack fools, I'm strictly ever gon' gank move
I hate to be the one that have to take it
But you best believe I'd die to make it
Anywhere in the world I'm standin with my pockets naked
Set it out set it out, that's what I'ma holler
On some slick, tryin' to come up quick, witta trusty ole dollar
Watchin you watchin me, hope I slip and bust my knees
I'ma have to greet you at the pond, you should just be thinkin' C's
Comin' out at ease, no matter what I'm still hard to please
Flap flappin sky, be real till the day I leave so sneeze
Chorus: Reel Tight
Talin bout that money, dollar
Gettin' that money, gettin' paid
*Repeat x3*
(Never)
We, smackin and stackin, packin, strappin, what's happenin'? Rollin'
Cruise-controllin, the fo' and Daynes swell up
Get the hell up, trump-tight click just in case I'm lavish
Tryin' ta fade me, you crazy ladies, babies created
Men are shady, straight make me drink till my thoughts get swavy
I think, maybe if I blink things will get back gravy
But loccs in the hood they lord be makin' it hard so lately
But I gotta stay at the table, 'cause that raw dope is that will pay me
Westside of California, on these corners pimpin' daily
Retire out on the lakefront, smokin' blunts
Takin' the sale G, trap me like the male be
To the Westside I'm a mental, all the regulators trail me
(Kilo)
Don't kick it out, let's do this
Comin' out the do', we down to wall
Gotta get in the business,
Tell me what's the call, we to the fall to ball
We can't just fold up,
Gotta whole bunch of homies dependin on this, sho'nuff
This only hustle is for brothers,
Feel to bring the business so slow up
And we still up on a mini gold rush
Ready to make the world go down
Bound to get it 'cause I'm down wit it
Now shitty the city, Conflict's causin critics to bite tongues
Ain't the one, with the shotgun, showdown
My town to your town on the rebound for them papers
(Warren G)
It's like brother brother brother how you make 'em get down?
From the LBC to the Chi-town, Westside straight gettin' down
Hittin switches and we checkin' all snitches
Gettin' all riches, and flossin in our pictures
It's time for some new hits, one of us
You know I spit some coast to coast love from your homey G Dove"
7,Dope Beat,1999,I Want It All (1999),,Warren G,"I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G (I wanna)
A dope beat (with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
Y'all know me, the G from the 213
LBC, Regulatin, skatin' on all them Dayton's
Bankin' back on them singles
With the Henney's and the Jimmy's
Like I'm all tall, short, and like dark, thick and skinny
I'm a ladies' man, Mercedes and
Proper ice, livin' nice, as far as gravy stands
Ain't nuttin' changed, me and Snoop's still the same
Plus Nate droppin' weight with the classic thang
Now I remember way back, at the bachelor set
Slip my brother, Dre, Snoopa tape it, put it in the deck
The party started bangin' and they both shook hands
And made it legitimate for the G-Funk Fans
Now after that, they hit the top when The Chronic dropped
Remember 187 on the motherfuckin' cop (I wanna)
It's Still A G Thang (with my), where we hang and claim
East Side till I die, or I rise to fame
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G (I wanna)
A dope beat (with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
I got my own style, I got my own pal
If you don't know now, then nigga, you better slow down
Spendin bills, bendin' wheels, people think I steal
Puttin' cameras in my grill everywhere I chill
Kick back, I spit facts, and twist our tracks
Drank gin with The Twinz, see a bitch I mack
'Cause if I ain't in the studio, I'm deep in the hood
Anyway gettin' paid like Warren should
Dre teachin' me to work a beat, now I'm bangin'
And I been with platinum, now my album slangin' (I wanna)
Hangin' with my G's (with my) from the LBC
With the homies that I know will put it down for me
Well known, keep my chrome, and I hold my own
But I'd rather roll and flow and be holdin' the shows
With the G-Funk Family earnin' a Grammy
You can't see what I see, and don't understand me
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G (I wanna)
A dope beat (with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
I'm on my way to the studio, beatin' and thumpin
Scoop D from Long Beach got some heat from Compton
Hit the Eastside manages to see what's crackin'
Got some MGD, just watching for jackin
It's a hard knock life, ya heard Jay-Z featuring Annie
No Limit like Snoop, that's when the grammy
Hit the Beach in the Long gray and black caddy
Reminiscing on my great escapes through the alley
Damn I done grew up and things done changed
Just shakin my head, trippin' off the game
It's so much you gotta do to keep it real out here
But ain't nothing guaranteed 'cause ain't nothing goin' give
(Chorus x3 to fade)
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
A dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G"

This rap shit got my own cactuses
Like we never slept on the same mattresses
Young age football practices
Biscuit shine, Five of the ones on the waistline
I ain't worried about no platinum change
I'll give ya a 59 with a batman ass go range
(Mumbled speech)
Ok, musta being the zodiac
V.I.P I really don't let this shit get to me
I just flip tracks, spit facts
Get relaxed, with G Funk laxed in the back
We stay in the ghetto, havin' a tap with rugrats
Cats, and taps, with flaps
Foul language, old English it's dangerous
It stays the same and never changes
(Crumbling cries)
G Funk is here to stay
I pop a cap
Domino's and spades
With a bag of gange and smoke it all day
There's a staircase, it's a true 21
Here's a toast to the thugs
High drop 4 sheezy, drinkin' ma bud
I still love n-a-t-e
Rollin' from the sheezys
With a dress code like dubsy and a circle arse
G-Funk is here to stay"

I'm the illest, the illest you've ever seen
Haha check this shit out do'
Peep game, look, hmm
She used to tell me that she loved me all the time
I turned to her, and say that I'm
Infatuated, concentrated on cuttin' it up
Body bustin' out your blouse, don't button it up
Me and you could make a getaway, up in the cut
I'm just a squirrel in your world, bustin' a nut
Slide in the passenger side and creep to the tilt
And maybe you could get a chance to sleep on my silk
Because you come with, that A-1 shit
The kind I wouldn't mind havin' a 20-year run with
I'm done with these games, played by these dames
I could exit the drama the same way that I came
'Cause I gotta put it down for my sons
So you, skanless scuds gets none of my funds
'Cause I can't be in love with my pockets on fee
Get the money, the power and the rest come for free, you know

I let you hang (I let you hang around)
So you could see (so that you, could see)

Now baby, look at the time
We gotta do what we gotta do
The club's about to close, don't you wanna ride
In a Rolls, Royce? Make it real moist
Take the Rolls to the jet, take the jet to my yacht
Letcha kick it for a week in my Caribbean spot
Coconut milk bath (bath), private beach, first class (class)
Water clear like glass (glass), waves ticklin your ass
Cut the act baby, you need a change of pace
I deliver you a whole new world of taste
Guaranteed to put a different timid look on your face
Put the arch in your back when I'm grippin your waist
Warren G keep flippin the bass on key
'Cause you rollin' with a G when you're rollin' with me
Easily I spit game to make it hot
Headed straight for the motherfuckin G-Spot, you know
(Warren G talking)
See now look at the picture
You got a lotta women out there preaching about
How they ain't a bitch or a ho but now
If you carry yourself in a fashionable matter
Game can be matched both ways by a player
Not a player hater, please believe it
It's told not to be sold by me
You know what, it ain't my fault

I let you, hang around, so that you, can see

The hits don't stop because the game don't wait
And the girls don't stop because the dick is straight
Let me teach you what I already know
The hits don't stop so its time I go
Game don't wait
Shit don't stop because the game don't wait
Game don't wait
Shit don't stop because the game don't wait
(Warren G)
Now it's the second time around ain't no phonies any fakes

You older than me, you say OG, you almost 40
Tryin' to stay young and sporty
Sport you roll me those and stay in ya place
Before you see all-stars, right up in ya face
(Snoop)
Youngsta never bite the hand that's feeds you
Proceed to get back to your folks, the loccs that need you
We do, we always keep it on the true
213, that's the name of the crew
Its true, that the dirt I did
As a kid got me caught up, but I was brought up
With the M-O if a D-O, so play your info,
Youngster I been doin' this before I hit the radizzo
Snoop D Z is off the heezey
So you can make mine, extra cheesy
The crew's a twist 'cause it consists of
3 riders, eastsiders, one love
The hits don't stop because the game won't change
All we ever wanted was a small time rap chain
Game don't wait
Shit don't stop because the game don't wait
Game don't wait
Shit don't stop because the game don't wait
(Nate Dogg)
The shit keeps movin it'll never stop
Long as we able to make hit roccs
Long as a papa can't stop my flow
The shit don't stop I gotta make my flow
The shit don't stop if you intend to take
The shit don't stop its companies we break
Take all the money and toss them hoes
The shit don't stop that's just how it goes
Game don't wait
Shit don't stop because the game don't wait
Game don't wait
Shit don't stop because the game don't wait"

Down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me?
To village ghetto life?
Lemme tell you 'bout the village where I dwell is a...
Living hell still tryin' to make a heaven outta this right here
Watching for the postman hopin' for paper
Please stop the bus mr. driver... wait up
We got... Rock fights where the dead end meets
The stop lights is out so its dead in the streets
The countyline look long but I'm kinda hungry
So I pack a sack lunch and got on
Late for class again its half past 10 and
Moms gonna whoop mah ass again
Now and then I get the feelin' that the world is mine
I start sittin' back watchin time fly by but uh...
But I'm so proud to say... that the ghetto is the reason that I'm loud today
And you could come get a glimpse of what's happenin'
See for yourself how it is where I live at
Would you like to go with me?
Down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me?
To village ghetto life?
It shouldn't take long to see
The place that belongs to me
It's all good, ain't nuttin like home to me
No diploma but uh... I got some knowledge out of
My other partners that made it up outta here
And not a whole lot of us get rich
But like the old saying goes ain't life a bitch?
Aw shit! the landlord just raised the rent, fuck dat!
Them old days that came and went like this
There's mo ways you could use your time instead of
Looking for shit that you used to find
By the age of 16 ya finally come to grips
Livin' life like this and nuttin else mean shit
Looking for a smooth getaway
Cool 'cause soon I'll see a better day
And if not... then I gots to deal with it
I ain't makin' this up hell naw its real nigga
Would you like to go with me?
Down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me?
To village ghetto life?
No more suprises hopin I can open your eyes
And so I'm trying instead of lookin' up in the sky
I'm in the fast lane speed dreaming
Nappin on cruise control please believe it!
In my city when you see it that night
Look different than it does in the day
Ain't no tellin' what had happened if it wasn't this way
I ain't trippin' off of shit it's a good thang
I made a name off the local neighborhood gang
And at that time I started rhyming and...
Set up a hill without help to start climbin'
And now I've been around this for a minute
You gotta get ur own mix and get wit it
I made myself learn to pay myself
Nigga the game don't wait so ima stay myself
And now you can go and tell another nigga
Of how the real ones is livin' in the ghetto
Would you like to go with me?
Down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me?
To village ghetto life?
Would you like to go with me?
Down my dead end street?

And it's like that

All glassed out with the count of the bitch
Screaming nigga I ain't having that shit
I represent niggas that love to ball, and still be trappin'
And only drink outta the bottle with the gold wrappin'
If it's gon happen I'm the one that make it go down

That parade in blue, and yelling 'cause (what's up 'cause)
Ate by selling drugs
'38 snub in the waist, in case fools lose love
These days still the same
I can steal the flame, eyes kill with the pain
So I advise y'all to chill with the games
Entertain for the cheddar and the change
So fuck whoever, in the fame, forever a man
Around my dogs, banging the pound, swanging the town
How we choose, now I'm aggravated and assault is my next move
Success means issues, so I guess it's time for me to disclude
Handle mines, we use pistols
G's move with the conscience
When we disaprove of that nonsense
Ex-cons with that gangsta gangsta gangsta shit
Here come another hit
(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination, in the industry
Here comes another one

I can see us smashing up the shore past laws that's lost
2000 Ucon Excel, duel exhaust
TV screen, DVD, E-mail
Passenger, bad female, what the hell
Stash spot, with the hollow head shell
Niggas start trippin', I'm on the next tail
Hands free, callin' up my nigga Warren G
I pull strings, like Mya Landske
Bulletproof, emotint you can't see
Mr. G rollin' up weed, afghany sensee
Bad MC, Mike Fiend, you the know spinage
Like wintergreenmint, talk shit
Sleep with the fish, you cement
New residence, with no hesitance
It gets tints on the floor
Staple center chick, next to Denzel and Nicholsen
Phil Jackson whistlin'
(Warren G)
Mean mugs in the club, mean nothing to us
In South scene, me and the team trying to fuck us some sluts
Dying to fuck, I chuck us when we step through
Poppin' our collars, with our nephews
Next to you, you got millionaires moving
Hitting the dance floor, stealing their groovin'
Doing they damn thing, and ain't worried about a damn thing
But man, that's the celebrity ways
Poppin' a litty got some rappers scared of these days
Industry ways, that's how Hollywood pays
Uh, top dollar when I dip my Impala
In front of the club, make your woman wanna holla (holla)
At a playa though, what's your dude yo
I keep it gangsta, I ain't trying to be rude hoe

A brand new song to sing

Long Beach back in the day was all hustling
Young niggaz in the neighborhood struggling
Praying to god we amount to something
By living on the street where they constantly busting
Big Warren told us that they can't hold us
Niggaz ain't shit till they pass away
So I, watched my step
But when Ola Mae left I was a mothafucking basket case
For real
God bless me
'Cause I be on the east where they wanna arrest me
I break bread so they wanna suspect me
But look me in my eyes and say they wanna protect me
Yeah
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, got me a profile
As a child in the Beach I was wild
Ready to die and that's why...
(Nate Dogg - chorus)
(Warren G)
Could it be it was all so simple
Dropping a slick instrumental
Snoop busting 'bout the shit we went through
Nate singing 'bout the city we came from
And niggaz so tight wasn't nothing we wouldn't do
Time keep slipping
But I ain't tripping nigga it's all about my children
So you can save that bullshit
'Cause if I pull my shit, nigga I'ma kill you
The streets is watching
And niggaz fell victim from L.A. to Watts and Compton
But life goes on
It's just another song if you ain't to one gone
Listen
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
But now I got a brand new G-Child
Big Warren gotta stay trunk tight
'Cause he got the fly and that's why...
(Nate Dogg - chorus)
(Warren G)
Listen
Caviar wishes, twisting stitches, all out race for the riches
Got a nigga missing what rich is
And what a life mean if you do it for the kids
It's for my family y'all
Really the only one who understand me y'all
'Cause it ain't hard to ball
But then who got ya back when it's time to fall
And it's amazing
To stay up on top, your game so close to the pavement
Time brings change in mind
But then don't let the change bring your mind no time
Clearly, a conspiracy
Niggaz right near me but still ain't hearing me
That's how it's always gone fly
Till you ready to die and that's why...

I seem to maintain through this
Watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist

Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

There they go with they assumpitons
Slaverys over let us have somethin'

Tryin' to hustle up from broke to ballin'
And, yeah, y'all in effect that's all me
The jiggy G-Z, all my niggas that keep it real and do it easy
Believe me, young nigga, gettin' fat meat is greazy
And bitches stank, 'So what?' you reply, they can hear the bank
Get away, or get gappled, the very next day
Don't cry, hold your head up high
And remember what you told yourself, nigga
I said remember what you told yourself, nigga
I said remember what you told yourself, nigga
I said remember what you told yourself, nigga
(Mack 10)
I want it all, so I got to wake up and ball
And thanks to y'all, I got plaques on the wall
Mack 10 laced with the know how to paper chase
Crushed ice, throw my Rollie face in the platinum fan base
From net workin' and hustlin', no doubt, I got slout
And live the lifestyle that Robin Leash talkin' about
Slow down, player, don't hate 'cause you can't relate
The Bently Coupes and kickin' gears on Harley's with the straights
I got more lime light than Vegas on cable
Willing and able to shoot, seen nervios at the craps table
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high
My nigga fly and fly, with desire to build an empire
I strapped up and took flight like a missile
Told them loud and clear as a whistle 'Hoo Bangin' is official'
Handing out Roman diamonds at roll-call
I'ma ball and never fall 'cause Mack 10 want it all
(Warren G)
Me and 10 get paid escapade to the spot
We hots like rocks served on hot blocks
I notice money make the world circulate
So we gon' stack and stack and take a sip in ?Perkle Lake?
Bump, let the woofers sub (sub), show the homies love (love)
Warren to the G (G), and Little G-Dub (Dub)
Surface on the low, slide or don't slide at all
Ride or don't ride at all

Warren, I couldn't be more serious about my 'fetti
I stay tight on the mic and keep the pen movin' steady
I want it all, dawg, and it might be greed
I hate to trip, but I got two little mouths to feed
They don't know nuttin' about no excuses and disrespect
Or somebody bein' zig with they Daddy's royalty check
And at that point, I'm through talkin', dawg, enough said
So, if you owe Mack money, then I suggest you break bread

I want it all, Warren G man

Check it out y'all
Call me Tikki Diamond 2000, I'm the future
I'm the voice that'cha need to get used ta
I want it all, y'all probably know by now
I want the world, y'all probably know by now
Here's my life, look at the three in front it
Bentley, me and Warren G in front it
Bougy nigga, I call lunch ""brunch""
Old school, I call punks ""chumps""
What's life without the best of it?
What's a half a ki if you ain't got the rest of it? Feel me
It's just the ways of the pros, the nay's and the no's
If y'all wanna see me, wear shades at my shows
You get G's like a fool, Killa Bees like the Wu
I ain't satisfied till I squeeze somethin' new
I want it with no miles, brand new smell
Put my life on wax, you'll be like ""Damn it do sell""
(Warren G)
Well ah, I want it all, I'm destined to ball (ball)
With plaques on the wall (wall), got somethin' for all y'all
>From ounces to quarters, and quarters to ki's
So when you come to the town you're watched over by Gz
The head honcho, buckin fools like a bronco
C-E-O, shootin cilo, ten be-low
A true vet on the worldwide set
Y'all don't know about them M-16's with bayonettes
Chorus: Warren G
I want it all, money, fast cars, diamond rings
Gold chains and champagne, shot every damn thing
I want it all, houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple of Benz's
I want it all, brand new socks and drawers
And I'm ballin every time I stop and talk to y'all
I want it all, all, all, all
I want it all, all, all, all, all
(Memphis Bleek)
Yeah
Yo, niggas eyeball my ho 'cause I'm sunk in the seat
Gettin' bent, but shit I deserve to eat
I hit the blunt for my bad broads
Hit a shot from the 4's for my dead dogs, pull off
Like, fuck the world, I don't owe y'all nuttin
If I do, take it in blood, the Memph don't front
I pump, for the goods, nice house in the woods
But I'm from the projects, it don't look that good
I gotta pissy elevator (and) a dog staircase (and)
Tre-8 and crack, wan' fuck with that?
I got beef with the D's for the way I rock my jeans
Stand on the corner with blunts and Coronas
Couple of birds, and I'm tryin' to hustle for birds
Throwin' dice on the curb, twistin up this herb
I want money the fast way, the crack stash way
Gat blast way, the last laugh way motherfucker
(Drag-On)
Aiyo, listen up faggots, my bullets gon' do more than nip you
It's gon' place you in sometin black where they gotta zip you
Rain wash away the chalk, and according to who you are
While you're snorin in the morgue, you'll get a drawing on the wall
You can't see me so don't look, I pop off cops like moon shook
Shells will fill you up like home cook
Forget about the book, ain't no recipe when y'all step to me
It's only one way up and that's if y'all don't pay up
Y'all pays forth, them days is up
You're lucky if you'll be able to
Walk straight enough 'cause I'm done with beefin
Like a bad stomach but I puts the runs in these niggas
'Cause I was raised, if a nigga ass cheeks make him an athlete
Some niggas say I'm spoiled, nigga how's that?
I ain't got no mom and no dad, I ain't know where the fuck my house is at
All I knew is where them ounces at and what I'm countin' back
Or if a knot come up short, who I got a pow for"

My L.A. ass
Disrespect

Hey you acting like earning the
Best rapper walk the earth yet (no)
I guess some big tymer tapping her
I huff, and puff
Blew her fat rat ass off
Blaze her
Shit, in the face
The most rapper
Why she acting like it didn't know
While I pulls up on her Rolls
I gets in it
I'm like bitch it's
Best you write down your number this minute
Catching her going
Just sparking off
And she came to her sister
Before the car took off
We know what to do
If we give you the chance
You'll fall in love
And all the time won't remain
The way you look
Your touch is fine
But I won't let you blow my mind

It ain't nuttin wrong with you
Me and you (we do it nasty, nasty)
(Warren G)
I once knew a girl named LaShonda
Short little cute thing
With a pinky diamond ring
She was iceless
My game was so priceless
Givin' her a facial
I was G'd up
From the feed up
Pushin the bent
With the midnight tint
Huh, heaven sent
(Mista Grimm)
I once met a girl in the valley and
Half black half Italian
Ass like a stalian
Coke bottles shake
As she likes to watch herself on tape
Breakin nuts shake, but wait there's more
She keeps my nuts in her mouth like a squirrel
Pranksta with a pearl
Held my balls so long
I call trouble when I'm with my girl
(Warren G)
There's a law for that
We ain't trippin', we hogs for that
Uh
(Chorus: Warren G and LaToiya - repeat 4X)
It ain't nuttin wrong with you
Me and you

I met this Puerto Rican named Sehonnie
She was as bad as Carmen
Chillin' in New York and I cracked her in Spanish Harlem
Straight dime
Body bangin' like a baseline
And the face fine
I had to spit dip waste time
Mr. Passionate
Everything her body was immaculin
The presence like a gift to men and got packaged
(Boss Hogg)
Fuckin' fabolous
She say ""damn he fat""
Then I still fuck the ass (how you do that)
Push up on 'em till they fall to the plot, damn it
Uh, hog 'em while they fuckin' roll, goddamn it
Call me fat boy with a fat dick to mash
To lick me baby and I might lick you back
(Damone)
Lickin' you back
She's gaggin with a dick in her trap
And stickin is fat
I'll pull it out and tickle your cat
(Previous Chorus)

I put the smash on her like Shaq
She want the cash on her
I ain't havin' that
You need to check yo' trap
I got rose cap
G'd up, 213, please believe that
(Mista Grimm)
I stay pimpin' in a bubble I Benz
With hoes stubbled up and cuddled in the back with my friends
I slide up on 'em like a cross fader
The hook up later
And serve this dick like a waitor
I ain't tryna date her
(Damone)
When it comes to bitches
I got more game than the olympics
I get up in their mind and analyze and twist this, psychology
For no reason I'm receivin apologies
Break her down mentally
Have her stockin and follow me
(Boss Hogg)
Trick be swallowin me
For a nine on the vein
'Cause I'm the fuckin' boss, she's my employee
I ain't hatin', I appreciate you freaky ass style
Yo nasty ass ?, eat a dick and smile

26,Keepin' It Strong,2001,The Return Of The Regulator (2001),,Warren G,"(Warren G)
Sometimes I sit back and think about how it was
When I was young, I used to think it was you I couldn't live without
Somehow, life took a sad route
Sometimes the wind blows bad enough to take a plane down
Your straight bullets killed children on playgrounds
Bullshit got me about to smoke a whole pound
Meanwhile, I smile, hoping I can rebound
Somehow the LBC streets ain't the same now, without you
Things ain't been the same since you ain't around
But I stay strong game tight, hold it down
Warren G, I never played a blackground
This song is fucked up, because you gone
(Chorus: El DeBarge)
Ooh, I see ya standing there
With the moonlight shining in your hair
Ooh, It makes me reminsce
Over and over, again and again
(Warren G)
Nothing means more to me, than family
When one lost, its sad to see, damn it's me
A friend you will always be
Above all things, you taught me to pursue my dreams
With joy it brings, at times when I sit and think
I know inside you smiled down, proud at me
I just need one more drink, damn
At night I can't sleep, I admit that its hard to eat
It's all good, I ain't trippin'
Tried to show me the right laws and guidelines
But I ain't listen, I'm sitting here lavishing and living
And I'd give it all back because you still missing
(Chorus: El DeBarge)
(Warren G)
Lord please hear me, ease my soul
I woke up one day and my mom was gone
I'm in the zone wishing I could call your home
Sing your song, tell ya that I'm out on tour
All alone, I just needed to hear your voice on the phone
Mother and son, though I'm grown
Life moves on, I need you mom, a quiet storm
Differences and right and wrong
As I move on, since Warren G ain't gone
The stitch is on, set the tone, the page I'm on
Is having fun, having a ball, living life
I'm still here, wishing you was home
(Chorus: El DeBarge)
Over, over, over, over, over
Again, again, I miss you
Oh mama, don't know, don't care
How I keep it strong, keep moving on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on
Keepin' it strong, keep movin' it on, mama"

When I step up in the place, your chance is gone
That bitch you was glancing on
If she leave with me, no chance that her pants is on
No bra, no panties on
Make her suck the same thing that my hand be on
Red room, thick bitch with a sandy tone, we gone
South beach in the Miami zone, Damn she grown
Bad little candy cone
One head nod from me, she out the door
One hand job from her, she out the door
Don't trip pronto bitch, out the door
Back to the beach, backyard, Delano
All bullshit aside, she a cold piece
The type that might go search the whole beach
The type that might go out and bring back some thing whack, screaming
Fuck Me, Fuck Me, Fuck Me

Sexy walking with that attitude
You're lookin' at me, I'm lookin' at you
Although I know I'm with my man, I just can't help but check for you
Lookin' at me, I'm looking at you

Lookin' at me, I'm looking at you
Just imagine how this could go, I want you so
And if you give me a chance, boy you know it's gonna get real

I take mine, small waistline
Face of a dime, waste no time
Grind on the dick, take mine wit a lick.
You still be singing that Sunshine shit
It's your world girl, come collide with the dick.
Some Hot Zone champagne Heather Hunter, Dominique
Some moan shit, home alone on some groan shit,
King Kong make you moan wit this, and still want it all
In the club bathroom stall, backseat take your clothes off
I still fuck your broad. And all it take is one phone call,
Show up and I'm beatin' up all walls
No joke, she broke all laws, handcuff and it's a lost cause

I got a spot where we can both let go (Creep)
If you can kick it holla let me know (She creeps)
I'll keep it on the low (Creep creep creep creep)

Love to get between the sheets and cheat on your dude
Besides, these drugs, got me in the mood
After the club we can choose how Stella got her groove
I ain't tryin' to be rude, meet at my room number 2-1-3
Private slumber party, with your name on the V-I-P

28,My Momma (Ola Mae),1999,I Want It All (1999),,Warren G,"Yo I wanna take this time out to dedicate this song
To one of the most beautiful ladies in the world
Could never imagine
Yeah, Ole Mae, that's my momma, y'know
To one of the most beautifulest ladies in the world
I love ya momma, keep it strong for ya
Chorus: repeat 2X
My momma, used to tell me quit smoking weed
My momma, gave me everything I need
My momma, said keep faith in God
My momma, momma, momma, momma, momma
(Warren G)
From the beginning, soon as my feet touched the earth
For what it's worth, she loved the boy from birth
Kept me fed, combed my head
And tapped that tail when I didn't do what she said
Through the years comin' up momma always provided
And when the times got rough momma always tried to hide it
Divide it among us, but pardon the youngsters
Told us never to lie, smoke dope, and cuss
She stood tall and proud like a supermodel on a catwalk
And momma didn't take no back talk
She's the main reason why I roll today
That's why I dedicate this to Ole Mae
That's my momma
(Warren G)
As a young teenager I started to clown
My momma did all she could to try to slow me down
Tired of her son be brought by the cops
Sent to go stay with my pops
He taught me to be my own man, and when I disrespected
He put me out on the streets to find my own land
Now I'm servin' on the urban street corner
Smokin' bud, sippin Coronas in Long Beach, California
But I promised my momma I would make it to the top
And use this rap to put her in the drop
She the main reason why I roll today
That's why I dedicate this here to my Ole Mae
(Warren G)
As I grew up, blew up in the G-Funk Era
I see my momma every time I take a look in the mirror
I'm thankful she gotta chance to see me shine
My momma's in my heart and my soul and mind
Controllin mine, so I can stand strong
For ya grandkids to let 'em know that ya spirit lives on
I really miss you, but I know ya looking over
Lead me on the right track, the angel's on my shoulder
(Warren G)
So I want y'all to treasure ya mom
Ya know, so if y'all got a bad relationship
Or y'all on bad terms, patch it up
Ain't nothing wrong with that
That's a precious jew-el
Remember that, we all gotta go through it
So stay strong, down dis, dis road, ya know
But I can't forget about all the poeple
Out there that I love, and got my back
So I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna shoot a shout out
My daddy, my sistas, my brothers, my girl, my kids
My cousins, my aunties, my uncles, my grandmomma
My granddaddy, all my homeboys, all my homegirls
And everybody out there that got love, knowwhatI'msaying?
We gotta keep it like that, we gotta keep it groovin"

Fuck around with Warren G it's a tragedy
Real niggaz, real shit, reality
Warren G top dog
Patrollin the beach
Niggaz say they as hard as bitch
But they're as soft as a peach
Claimin the G of all G's
Please
I come blowin' through like the breeze
Sittin' on threes
Post it
Coastin mashing down Pacfic Coastin
The bomb chrome rims black on black Yukon
With nuts hangin' from the city
Where the bangers is being banging
It don't seem like shit is changing
I holla'd at the homey the other day
G'ded up at the park sippin alisah
One of the homeys took a beaten
So now we spend at being a gang
Of checking at the meetin like cycles repeatin
It's just another sunset fall in sea
I can here the homeys in the past callin me
And you know what I discovered
What they keep saying
Keep your mind on your money
Muthafuckers and shake busters
Have you ever sold millions
But yet you niggaz persist to talk shit
Get of my dick
You never catch me slipping
Rollin' with the heat
Slap the clip in
I never thought the world would started trippin'
My life is a trip, though
Hit the crip though
Blow the whistle
They think I banged
So I packed a pistol
Warren to tha G is a G
I don't fuck with you nigga
So don't fuck with me
Let's ride to the east side
Slide like a fo
I packs a fo-fo
When I'm steppin out doors
To the bang to the buggy
If I speak then I spoke
Warren G do it every time to you Locc
Get the party beat like blaze and smoke
The east side and the beach
West side of the coast
You know the niggaz that I ride with
Hogs, attack dogs
The same niggaz I'm down to die with muthafucka
Who's the man
I've been from London to Japan
Stomp land to land
To the Egyptian sands
You can't check me
Dis-respect me
Or mop me up
With the base bumpin' out my truck
And all these police trying to lock me up
Money rules the world
And I made the loot
So don't make me shoot
'Cause trying to mash
Will get you done every time
I ain't trying to hurt nobody
But I'm down for mine"

Hold on tight to your seat
Comin' from the city that's low, urban life near the beach peep
So come one, come all, fall into my smooth flow
It's the Trip LO double C yo
The game is trump tight, ain't no need for you to boo me
'Cause after it's over, all you hoes goin' wanna do me
Its part of the plan to get mine from the jump
G-Dub hooked it up, so you know its gotta straight bump
A typical day on the eastside
A lot of gangstas buck mouths
And brothas slangin bean pies
But that's how it goes in the city where I was born
Familys mourn, niggaz slippin, never gettin' born
So that's why you gotta stay alert,
'Cause everyday somebody's out, they tryin' to put in a little work
For the hood, or just on the solo
Walkin' in Long Beach real late is a no no
But don't let me scare you, you do what you gotta do
Respect is a must, checkin' niggaz that try to check you
Y'alls niggaz betta recognize,
Focus your eyes 'cause my homey's high
Y'alls niggaz betta recognize,

And ain't no nigga gonna be takin' mine

So if you really wanna watch this trigga flow
Its kinda itchy but I know I shoulda pulled it a long time ago

So when it gets hot well I gotta shake the spot
And move to that other level see Wayniac comin' through in 94 LBC
(Twinz)
Now you know the game and the games complete
(Whys that?) 'cause the Twinz are bringin' nothin' but heat
And ya know you didn't wanna see the Cavi flow

So open your eyes and pay attention
Its two of my homies on a muthafuckin mission

And I, kicks up dust 'cause it's a must
And I, acts a fool 'cause it's my rule
So need we say more on this topic
Warren G droppped it

32,Regulate,1994,Regulate...G-Funk Era (1994),,Warren G,"Regulators
We regulate any stealing of his property
We're damn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean, earn your keep!
Regulators! Mount up!
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G. was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 2-1-3
So I hooks a left on 2-1 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin' dice so I said ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said ""What's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won't 'cha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said ""Damn, what's next?""
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glance in the cut and I see my homey Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin'
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G. had to regulate
I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb
Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up 'cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me
The Warren to the G.
Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G. Child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""Ooh, I like your size""
She said ""My car's broke down and you sing real nice,
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel
I'm tweaking
Into a whole new era
G-Funk
Step to this, I dare ya
Funk, on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm
If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you're high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
2-1-3 will regulate"

Back for the 9-c
I ex sippin on the yak so people wanna know what's next
Ain't nothin' changed, another day a new time
With this uptempo beat with the G-Funk rhyme
Regulatin state to state, coast to coast
It's all about the call of greens, yak, lets toast
'Cause it's a ballin society
I try to be the dopest I can be in this industry
But you don't hear me
I think ya betta, I think ya betta
'Cause when I, get it goin' on I ain't gonna let up
I set up, the g-funk family and we
Funkin up the industry until eternity
Its all right with you if its all right with me,
We'll get down to the sounds of the LBC
Chorus: repeat 2X
Relax your mind, your mind, your mind
Relax your mind and let your conscious be freein you down
To the sounds of the Warren G
It ain't easy bein Gz
But the lifestyle I chose, the status to which I rose
The doors, I open, I'm loccin, I'm scopin
Through the eyes of the G Child
I see many try to duplicate the LBC style
But it ain't even happenin' like that
I was time I had to make a comeback
And get mine, you know I'm genuine
Been in motion with the potion with Snoop since 89
Devotion is the key for me so,
Relax your mind and let your conscious be free
The homey just touched down, foolin wit a pound
Put yo gun down, so you can walk a safe ground
Chorus: repeat 2X
I know it's been hard on you for about two, so
I had to relax your mind, I thought you knew
Ain't nothin' but a Long Beach party
With yo hands in the air, with the twist of Coke and Bacardi
All the homeys around and the slingshot t-shirts
Skirts wit the baby fat it'll work
Pass me the indosmoke and get locced
From the beach to the bay, makin' them sway
Like the ocean in motion, we coastin
Relax your mind and keep floatin (floatin, floatin, floatin)
And walk a safe ground
Chorus: repeat 6X"

Notorious bitches but I don't love no one time
So peep it as I take ya down the backstreet
Show you how I do it (how ya do it)
I breaks 'em off to get my ends meet (pow)
Victim of the ghetto so I'm sluggin
The man wont give me mine so the whitey I'll keep muggin
I'm trapped up in a cycle but I'm keepin' my humanity
'Cause I ain't goin' out (us niggaz always keep activity)
Niggaz say I'm crazy but to others I'm just nutty
'Cause I don't give a damn, ya life ain't shit without no money
That's why niggaz keep doin' niggaz but I'm not that nigga to be done
Ya fuckin' around and set it off Long Beach is where I'm from

Ron Isley, I's be Warren G
Baby said would ya please come roll deep
Chocolate Thai, I said I
Got the hennessey chaser, skirt you look fly
Peepin them lips, hittin two finger sips
On the 710 freeway, I straight dips
Wit a fat one rolled up to puff
I'm ready to hit it and I won't quit it until I get enough
Tokin nothing but the bomb that's without no doubt
As she twist up another split she's straight smokin' me out
Ronald Isley
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
Warren G
I slinkin while I'm thinkin' just how good it is
To do it how we do it in the hood I live
Passin homies on the block, gettin' major respect
And by then y'all the hen dog is taken effect
Never panic hit Atlantic then I banked to right
Pulled straight Nellin B's order steak and rice
With the gravy, baby gets the shrimps and fries
I'm diggin on her figure as I glimpse her thighs
She's satisfied, I left the tip and dipped to get back
To twist another zag and to grab a six pack
She went back, so we proceed to parlay
Everything is lovely and we doin' it always
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
This ain't no love ballad
But see baby I gots to have it
When I see that bomb I grab it, 'cause it's a habit
So don't come with that toe down stretch
I ain't stressin, Long Beach baby keep smokin' me out, she learned a lesson
Floatin high as a kite as I chill and lay low
Bumpin time is collected, Sunday nights on the radio
Oh, I forgot, how lit I was, crazy glued to the seat
Dog said she need
So conversation ain't needed
When she know that I'm weeded
Headin to the hotel to regulate it and beat it
I exhaled, I seen a cloud of smoke
I banged it to the boogie by my head and got locced
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Oh she's smokin' me out with the homey's love

Ya know we said things won for Warren G, and soon turned superstar

11-10-7 D that was my intro
But now in 94, I'm rollin' a 64
'Cause things get shady where the grass is greener
Niggaz throwin' up sets in hoods like they neva seen a
Young mack daddy do his thing 'cause I pack right
I got 44 ways to make you act right
And it's a shame how the game must be played
It was told never fold by the niggaz you can't fade
So raise up off this young hog
'Cause I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me y'all
I got my own thang 'cause I let my nuts hang
If you wanna bring it, bring it on no pain no gain
So as I creep can you peep what I speak
Techniques unique, so what you sayin' is obsolete
So there it is as I go about my days
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em
(Wayniac)
It's all plain and simple
I roll just to serve a lifetime wit my niggaz
Idiotic fools can't figure
The way I display or should I say more than that
Its crucial when I name how many niggaz got my back
Neva lack, the skills when its time to handle mine
You can't front if you wanna but you still know the time
I'm, the nigga that they call Wayniac (what that mean)
I'm the nigga stayin down for the home team
So if you didn't know let me slow ya roll
This pro is on the go with some shit you ain't heard before
So recognize game in your face
A touch of the bass then I'm gone without a trace
(Warren G)
I stay true to the game
But some stay blind to the fact
That if I don't look good, you don't look good
So please rearrange and change the shit you doin'
You fuckin' yourself 'cause you the one gettin' screwed
As I, ease on down the rick road
As I shift from first to second, cruise control
So blaze up the buddha
'Cause I got drink, and don't think
We don't roll without a full tank
Of that bomb ass shit called the funk
'Cause I am the G and the funk is what you want
Now, lets take a trip to the other side of town
Niggaz flip flop and they neva stay down
Wanna be all they can be, but gettin' held back
Tryin' to take what is mine, (what) what type of shit is that?
So, this is for the homies stay down for your pay
I can't only bring it to you like this in so many ways"

It's a million and one ways to what people say
They gone say what they say but they fail to display
Where I went wrong, can't I do right
In the city I face snitches, with no britches
Quick to judge and hold a grudge
And all this time I show them love

Played my hand when they delt my cards
Now check it out what's real is what's happening
Now this is where I deal with and where I live at
Not to many of us make (make it) it to see the day we able to make a statement (statement)

I'm takin' a bite out of rappers as if my name was MC Negra
(Warren G: She's hotter than the South land on fire)
All you MC's desire, to run through my pyre
I'm turnin' heads like the Exorcist while flexin this
'Cause it's the Super Soul Sis
Sat on the outside, but now I'm the arena
A superfly mackadocious one you never seen a
Soulful, 'cause I got a bowl-full of soul
Strollin because I have no vehicle to roll
But bring it bring it back to the topic of the solar mind
I can flow upbeat, to a slow beat, and be off beat and still on time
I rhyme, and swim waves of soul like Billy Ocean
Never ashy, lyrics that soothe ya like some lotion
'Cause I can Krush any Groove bust on any move ya make
I keep my rhymes attached, like trains to a freight
Break ya Achey like Billy Ray, I'm fuckin' up the industry
And fins to be,* Nanu Nanu like Mork and Mindy"
44,This D.J.,1994,Regulate...G-Funk Era (1994),,Warren G,"It's kinda easy when you listen to the g-dub sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin' as I smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo' yo' ass and it's easy to see that this DJ be Warren G
Can I get in where I fit in, sit in, listen
Let me conversate better yet regulate
Shake the spot with my knot, may fade
'Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
I played ball through the halls of C-I-S
With Snoop Dogg's big brother, call him Dirty Left
Rack 'em up, crack 'em up, stack 'em up against the gate
The homies tryin' to catch me but they can't. Wait
Damn, the street lights just came on
And my momma's on the streets tellin' me to come home
I hit the gate and I hops on my Schwinn
And I tell the homies, ""aiight then"", yeah
Verse two, now what the fuck I do?
Catch the bus to Cal State or chill with the Voltron crew
And make a few ends on the side
Here comes a baby blue van, time to ride
So I hops in the van with my nigga Tick
And Baby Poppa, back then, that was my click
We groovin' to Santa Ana
And we plan on makin' hellafied 'mount of money hell yeah
And what I did for extra fees
Was break niggaz after work playin' get like me

Too much smokin' that Sherman shit

The, the doctor, Andre Young
Compton, LB, ain't nothing y'all can tell me
Going hard on the yard, till me dogs bailed me
They tells me, I can't precede with it
I came back and got ole G'd with it
We get crunk, spit it when we drunk
Commited to that shit, that makes the gangstas stump
Chumps can try, if they choose to to
With these locs love my dogs like the Blues Clues
So excuse you, I'm the reason for the fame
And all of a sudden, you ain't believing in the name
What? Butch Cassidy, show 'em what we working with
(Chorus: Butch Cassidy)
This gangsta shit is too much
Don't be suckas, can't touch
It's working in the LBC, nonstop to the NYC
Warren G, with the gangsta three's, ooh wee!
(Warren G)
And the win, on the 7-10 southbound
Duece and gin, getting guzzled down by the mouth now
Smashing a hundred in the car pool
That's the type of thing that hogs do
My concern ain't the fame, I hope you know that
Status: millionaire, still don't show that
Go back to where I was raised
On the porch is where they got braids, never not afraid
To test my shot, drop a hundred dollar fade
Holla, don't be a major see me in the hood
Off TV, totally un-Hollywood
Still to the good and you know that
Still with me, still when you show that
And Big Snoop Dogg we gonna blow that
Still with it, we all say that we real with it
Until bustas reveal, how we really did it
(Chorus: Butch Cassidy)
(Warren G)
So what's crackin' now
Got these haters actin' now
Backin' down to this gangsta sound
Westcoast circus clowns
It's on purpose how I spit rounds
You trying to get down
Abnorm with the form, swarming heated
Hitting fools glocks like we got cheated
Repeated simotaneously
I'm bringing bangers with me
So hopefully, moves can be made
We can all get paid, relax in the shade
Sun, snow, it really don't matter
We can all make dough
Eastcoast, westcoast, midwest, dirty south
And big heads, is what I'm all about
And big heads, is what I'm all about
And big heads, is what I'm all about, fool

You're not chillin' in the house
Ya know why? huh? huh? Should I tell ya?
You know why? Yeah... 'cause ya ya ya ya chillin' in the shack beeyatch!
This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel

Put Knight at the individ
It's a nigga you can't get with
Funky styles, I be showin niggaz
I be blowin' niggaz straight out they socks, because
The Dove Shack is comin' more twisted than dredlocks
Now plot on the shack if you wanna
But if you get caught slipping
We will be dippin
Down your block
Just to street sweep your spot, nigga
But you can still follow along, grab ahold of my nut sack
Because I've got the doja
Oh I haven't told ya much love to my nigga Warren
He's a G, hook me, now I'm gettin' funky
I'm chillin' with my feet up on the table in the shack
With my revolver, problem solver
Waitin for a nigga to fuck with this
So I can let his ass know who he is
This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel
2 Scoops-
It's the nigga 2 Scoops, the Long Beach Eastsider
Niggaz start to duck when I come 'cause I'm a ridah
So I suggest you get the 411 on the shack
We peelin caps to the front, then we peel 'em back
Approachin the wrong way, with no delay I blast your ass
Draw for the gat but the Scoop is much faster
You can't miss me with that, step in my path
I let the AK ripper cut that ass in half
I dwells, I bells, in the LBC
The real menace to society
Packin up all righty
A flow, but watch the one I used to abuse this track
We in front of that ass and you still can't see the shack
So pack up your gear and run and hide
(And pass the doja to the left hand side)
We comin' like that, it ain't no love for no rat
I guess that's how we act when we chillin' in the shack
This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel
As you enter into the zone called the G Funk (now relax)
Here a lie a war with the west (Dove Shack)
Kicks it is a know em
Rip 'em will be torn
Dip it as we flip it
Wicked with the Warren G child
See styles, meanwhile freestyles have been rendered
I see the door of your mind, may I enter?
I knock and I promise I won't hurt you
The definition of G Funk is just something to like swerve
To something to smoke herb
To sunk we and we serve
Get with the dope herb
Take a tall kid beat the loccness
Lessons will be taught before caught in the shuffle
Flexin all the muscle, livin' large is fuckin' rustle
I'm Simmons, I'm Robin, like givin'
I know you love this funky style
Out this world, make your head twirl
Hear the less, now play the squirrel as you earl on the track
Who am I Bo Roc from The Dove Shack
This is the shack, this is how we act
Caps I peel, flex my steel
'Cause you ain't in the house, 'cause you's in the shack

It's expresso, mandle that I'm stacked
Niggaz, tryin' to corner the market but I'm back
Bang to the boogie, and boogie to the bang
It's G-Funk for life sewing up everything
Little locs, pay attention
Do I or should I have to mention
44 ways where the grass is greener
From OG to BG is a misdemeanor
St. Mary's Hospital, 10:20 AM
On the street called Atlantic is where I began
Ola May, uh, that's my lady, she made me
On a street under the bridge called hill, that's where she raised me
Transformers, busters in disguise
I say chitty chitty bang bang
Brothers wanna gang bang
Tryin' to represent but don't know about the gang thang
21st where it all begun
Begun us on the corner with the homies havin' fun
I was a youngsta, peepin from the other corner
Seeing sets in the air with big arms now I wanna
Be like them, and act like them
And stack like them and try to mack like them
Shit, its hard being Warren G from the LB
And like the G's before, you know me
So I'm a stay down, for the eastside
Not like you busters, transformers in disguise
One to twenty-one, and you know I ain't gonna stall
I gotta give it up with the homie roll call
OG cry baby, and the homie big roc
Mooch on the side with the stockin can ride
Big sugar mama, flee bag and
Lady roe guard and marathon they OG see
Salt Lake crew got little shorty Charlotte,
But back to Louis with T-Bone is where I started,
Livin' in the back in a little pink shack
If you know like I know then bounce to this track
Cerritos bounce to this

Under the bridge bounce to this

I make music for block pushers and go-getters
From gators, to house slippers, and Mo' sippers
The old, and new school, the hard hitters
And fuck whoever that don't roll with us
This here is international player
Fuck the Senator's daughter and have lunch with the Mayor
I'm in a league all by myself
Everything I done I did for me - by myself
Walked away from bullshit and called the inner circle
Had to get my head right (fuck Universal)
I took the time to be free again - grinding
I finally feel like me again
(Raphael Saadiq - chorus)
I gotta walk these streets again
I'm gonna roll on with my friends
I'll talke my time, I'll read the signs, I'll be just fine
Mo sipping with my chicks
So hold my telephone cards
I'ma just keep doing my thing, stocking this game, stacking my change
(Warren G)
A range meeting with lawyers and stock brokers
Then back to the block pouring liquor with shirt soakers
When it come to the dough, I'm about my cheddar
50 Cent ain't the first off to pop Berattas
I'ma walk this road and G here forever
Born and raised, addicted to this Cali weather
It feels good to be me right about now
If my moms could see me now she'd be proud
(Raphael Saadiq - chorus)
(Warren G)
All across the globe they know me
I regulate, international G
It ain't nobody as fly as, fly as who
Warren G and Raphael Saadiq, stop acting all edgy
Mentally it's cut already
Bet you won't bet me that your pussy ain't ready
I'm on track on my back, the monkey ain't heavy
Rock on with the mic gangsta beat rock steady
If music should die before I wake I pray the lord my soul to take
Dedicated to hits, and that's showbizz
Can't eat, can't live, can't no busters alive fuck with this
I ain't gone miss, I'm gone ride, put it down that's on my kids

And servin' this heat, through yo streets, jealous hoes peep,

While they comin' with drama, I'm blockin and steady knockin'
The post is won out the box, it don't stop, hittin our areas and shakin up spots

I'm bakin blocks in four wheel motion
Everywhere I look I see 21 ones floatin (21st Street!)
Then I made a stop at the P-A-C's
Wassup y'all? You seen Tripp L-O double C, now,
I'm headin to the back where the homeys is posted,
Niggaz on gat in case plat wanna get roasted
But you know how that go, in the city of snakes, fakes, hmm and bitch brakes

Bring heat to the table and play your cards right

Got the sky lit now who really wanna try it,
Its warm when we swarm, your area gonna get torn,
And a job that work g funk in the purest form,
For what its worth, I'm a let you know,
I'm hyperactive for those who react too slow, all alone
My fleets movin fast, hand in hand with the aftermath,
My skills was built to last
Wayniac-
Forever in a day, but some days we gotta trip,
Throwin' lics for grits, steady stackin our chips,
The money clips don't fit, now is it the way we dip on,
These and those, mo Gs and hoes, I assumes on a mission, (on a mission)
Conditions ain't the same got the average nigga wishin, but still missin',
The simple facts it ain't like that,
Turn the tables when the label don't react, its Wayniac
Jah Skillz-
Too much clout I'm havin' so niggaz be grabbin at my wealth,
At test a math, set them back on the shelf,
They say we love your skills, I'm good for your health,
My lifeline droppin' the dime on them like a stealth bomb,
Will calm a nigga down with my one round,
Suppose they act up, my back up's involved now,
GFCs included, my crew is undisputed,
Heavyweight champs, known for blowin' out yo amps
Trip Locc-
I had patience but now I'm anxious,
Lurkin like a cat on the deal with my sack,
I know somebody watchin the Locc,
Can't stop 'cause it just start poppin' please,

Over 60 billion served rollin' on the daily,
Can't tell me shit put it in and I won't notice,
Me and my niggaz nothin' but that top notch,
Long Beach postin up the road blocks,
You can't go through, or around, you gotta turn back,
I'm gettin' turned back, ridahs and killaz that don't play that,
Known to bring it on when it pop, missions to clock,
Stages to rock, when I'm done lounge at the spot

Sick sin, my ink pen stay in the ring
Crown me king, I spit through the eyes of a fiend

Blessed wit perception, but don't know how my days a go
Could see my nigga hittin wit some pay, a few days ago

'Cause I'm supposed to be all in wit my chips (nigga)
I'm all in with the crips and bloods
Grips for thugs, I nudge
The homey on his shoulda, 'cause every day I'm gettin' older
As the world turns and gets colder
Laid back I shot me sumpin, Perfec from dynamic, bangin' G-Funk
(Warren G)
Well I moved from the East to the West
Word on the street, niggaz wanna test
But these MC's, is scared to buck
Plus they talk too much and smoke too many blunts
You fuckin' rookies
Sweet as Mr. Smith's cookies
Ya hate me one minute and tha next ya wanna buck me
He sent a hoe, in the back seat of my fo'
While ya Goin' Back To Cali, watch how you flow
Now ya know, about this Warren G Era
G-Funk terror, look into tha mirror
And what you see is the don of the company
(Warren G, Warren, Warren, Warren's to tha G)
You still see, what I see
All of the homies in the LB
Sittin' back, and we makin' the cash
Warren G, Perfec, Hershey Locc and Bad Ass
And we never knew you had clue of what we go through
So how in tha fuck could y'all speak of our crew
Ya thought this, ya thought that, we thought y'all should laid back
Yeah it's like that, for me it's like that
Sittin' back, and we makin' the cash
It's Warren, Perfec, Hershey Loc and Bad Ass
Sittin' back, and we makin' the cash
It's Warren, Perfec, Hershey Loc and Bad Ass
Ya know what I'm sayin' Warren G
With my homeboy from the pound Hershey Locc
And the homey Perfec, ya know what I'm sayin' and Mr. Badass
And that's how we doin' it fool, yeah
We ain't bangin' on wacks nigga, we doin' it like we should be fool,
Yeah"
54,What's Love Got To Do With It,1997,Take A Look Over Your Shoulder (1997),,Warren G,"Ooh, yeah, yeah, what's love got to do
Warren G rap for me, yeah, mmm
When G-dog, the hog, come up in the place
There's dollar signs in your eyes and a smile in your face
You wanna live fat off of my sack
You got more drag than a low lo-do, cut the act
'Cause back before '92 and '93
You didn't give a damn about Warren G
But now that I'm slingin' platinum LP's
All of a sudden you on my N.U.T's
Ain't nothin' you can do to make it stop
'Cause money makes the world
Go 'round and the panties drop
I ain't in love though, I don't need the pressure
I just wanna dig it like I'm diggin' for treasure
Some of y'all had a good thing that you couldn't keep
Thought you was TLC, you had to creep
You say you had love, I said you bullshit
It's all about the dough, so what's love got to do with it
What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it
If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it
Now, I'm the type of brother that's down for mines
Before I made beats, I was down to grind
Back then, every single homey had my back
Now they're peepin' my stack and they're talkin' bout jack
But I'm the same brother day in and day out
And I'm-a stay that way until the day I lay out in a casket
It's drastic 'cause homies is plastic
Break 'em off some bread
They want the whole damn basket
If you's a true homey, you would wish me well
Not plot to make a brother fail, jealous as hell
We used to get the same riches
Now your trigger-finger got the itches, schemin' on my riches
Which is not a surprise, my eyes peep game
211's, 187's it's all the same
It's all a shame, homies'd jack you for your grip
Ain't no love involved, because it's all about the chips
What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it
Now for these labels tellin' fables
Makin' the fucked-up deals under the tables
You think that you smart, but fool, I'm the smartest
You can't make no money if you can't keep an artist
Sign the dotted line, put 'em on the shelf
Break 'em off some crumbs, keep the rest for yourself
I know how it goes, treat an artist like a ho'
Fly cars, gold, clothes, but no dough
Since it's all business, I'm-a handle mine
Keep track of my stack down to the very last dime
'Cause in this rap game, it's all about the buck
You bend over for the label, and you will get fucked
Like how we run up in a trick, and then you're through
The record label do the same shit to you
90% business, 10% show
Ain't no love in this game 'cause it's all about the dough
What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
What's love if you don't respect the game (uh-huh)
What's love got to do, got to do with it (that's right)
If you lack in this game, it's a shame you won't make it

(Warren G)
This DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while he go round
To the Hip to the Hop you just don't stop
Producing funky tracks till it makes you drop
Conjunction junction, what's my function
I'm hookin up tracks so that niggaz can function
It's not Pete Rock or that nigga Dr. Dre
It's this muthafuckin nigga from around the way
The one who brings you styles on timesy, whymsy
That's why it's so hard to find me
Conduction, construction when I bust choo choo, bustas
It's a must when I bust when I bust, I gotta come correct
The R to the E to the S-P-etc architect
Yup nigga no I'm not tweakin
Its one of the 16 minds that I'm speaking
The W-A the double R the E into the uh
A-B-C-D-E-F to the muthafuckin G
Ooh shit as I flex I wrecks I checks
So what's next
(Mr. Malik)
Oh who's next, to catch flack on the menu
I snap necks when I flex let me continue
Send you, on a mission when I rock
It goes on and on and on and you know it don't stop
Yes I'm back on another route, ready to take 'em all out
Now can't get with this, 'cause they get faded without a doubt
Check em, I wreck 'em like 1-2-3 why
They can't fuck with that rude one Malik
Will I drop, can't stop it, lit it up like a rocket
When they get out of line I grip the nine out my pocket
Lock it down, yeah that's what I do
How could you come solo nigga when I run through ya whole crew
I rule, fool, act like you heard it
The one I run with, can't remember the last he murdered
Dem do away or them get dealt with
Give the noise I want silence, no bubbaclad bullshit
Nigga, it's all about my grip
So the one who starts to slip is the one who gets ripped
Kept a chip on my shoulder not now that I'm older
They, all of me, the LBG high roller
'Cause back in the days on the side where we sat
Niggaz a come up missin' if they didn't have they strap
So why, try to be, like me
Just when you pull back a G and I think I'm Mr. Malik
Well if the beat is funkadelic then the tune is right
Mr. Malik and Warren G so tonight's the night that we spark
We spark in the dark when we do it in the park
(Mr. Malik)
Well it's the A to the B
(And the C to the D)
Hey my name is Mr. Malik with that DJ Warren G
(Mr. Malik can you hear me)
Yes I'm the host with the most they can't get close or even near me
(I said a tick, tock, tickin to the Era)
I said a pick which glock bitches get shot its still terror
(Terror, terror, pick which glock)
Which one? (the black one with the big pin lock)
Me and Dre and the fly honey so those who wanna get dropped
Nigga go knock, knock I trick a flow non-stop
Fly double I never slip trip or flip flop
The tune is funkadelic, the crew was right
But if Malik will make ya smell it then tonight's the night
For me to stay trump tight
Up with my nigga Warren G
That's sorrow when you borrow but you can't be oweing me
What's next
(Warren G)
Woo!
I say what's next, what's next what's N-X-E-T
It's me, Warren to the muthafuckin G
Flowin with my little homey named Malik
Yes, everybody will just tweak
Off the new style ill ease that we got
Yes, it's me Warren G on the block
Pump pump, block glock, let me just tick tock
It's me Warren G on the muthafuckin rock 'n' roll
Stroll, then stiff back to the rap
It's me with the big black mack 11 strap
So let me uh flix into the flex
Woo! So what's next
Well if the beat is funkadelic then the tune is right
Mr. Malik and Warren G so tonight's the night that we spark
'Cause we spark in the dark when we do it in the park"

Scapin through the streets with my niggas bumpin hellafied beats
See us, niggas play for keeps, kill the strong and the weak
>From the Eastside of Long Beach, that's 2-1 Street
See we, live and die by the gun and the knife
And I, high as a kite, corrallin through the night
Haha, stackin hundreds, we kept the drugs and hoes comin' (Come on)
Young gunnin, tortured, no need to be punished (Yeah)
All we have of the system is big cabbage
Lifestyles is lavish, livin' my life from Dallas
It was a challenge, livin' my life like a savage
To have or to not to have it or nobody can have it
Un-touch-able, inde-struct-able
Get in my way and we're dustin you
As a kid this the type of shit that we dreamed of
Money, cars, bitches and drugs
I prevail, the crack sales then got in jail
Couldn't post bail now my home is livin' in a cell
Thirty years with no parole as I grow old
You won't see me on the streets till I'm 60 years old
Chorus: Daz singing

Money and dreams got me hooked with schemes

Long Beach is the spot, got a lot of respect

I stay hungry so fill my plate
I'm just a young black nigga tryin' to flip an end
Five year probation, nigga fuck the pen
Whattup, Uncle Kev doin' eight upstate
I heard you're benchin ten plates, knockin' out inmates
It's just a way of life, nigga shootin the dice
Now you hit all craps, now you payin' the price
Livin' the thuggish life

G, Dove, we, mob
Killin' all y'all, that is our job
And if you thought it was The Gang then you hit it on the knob
Slide and flip like cocoa bricks, takin' your 6
And leavin' it on the side of the freeway on bricks
Schitzomanic, automatic, schizophrenic, six
It's just a psychosomatic, original
Dogg Pound criminal, ya ever heard of me?
Kurupt, Young Gotti, motherfucker D-P
Why is life fucked up? Toe-up
Scrapin from the flo' up to the ceilin, the fo's bust
For my children to grow
We live to let go, nigga

I blaze up the orange weed
To relax my mind
Spend time with my kids on the weekdays
And I holla at my momma and my
Grandma on the threeway
She say, If you do right
Baby boy I promise you live
A long life
I can't argue
I try hard to
Not blast niggas
I walk past niggas
With my head up to the skedai (sky)
Nigga tried to pull a fast one
On Snoop Dogg
To get some shut eye
What I do to him I can't speak
You know the episode
And the code on the street
I keep it all the scriffin' y'all
But real street for y'all
Cause you never know
When you're gonna go, no
You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you
Just Hold on
You never know

The robbing
The squabbing

Trying to set me up at the park
But I'm cool
Act a fool

And stay strong
My momma got sick
So I'ma keep it strong
As long as I got my feet in the game
And make this beats
And bring heat to the game
Fuck the fame
I got a little boy to see through
And him without me
Is like me without you
Keep it true
And stay down for your grips
Homies and licks staying tight
Like this
You never know

You niggas never know
Which man are blasted for
Never know which man to kill
Just to settle the score
It wasn't long ago
I had this partner of mine
Knew him just a short time
But he's stuck in my mind
My nigga lived perfect
Said the streets wasn't worth it
If you don't die rich in the game
Then what's the purpose for this struggle?
We stay piece to puzzle
Invest half the wealth
And pray to god it double
We just in this
Trying to get rich at the interest
Keep it pimping
Stay with niggas that's relentless
Smoke dough
Just because I say so
Money pronto
And niggas never would know
They never know nigga

She young, she young, she young, she young
I hit the 21 blocks each and every day
Niggaz peepin they shoulders in each and every way
No sweat, 'cause if I sweat it
I stay true to the game, so I'm not gonna let it
Take control of me, fool you can roll with me
From OG to OG you can reminisce with me
About the hutch, about the milk bowl,
Two dee took a bank left knockin' fools out on
It was me baby boppa and the homey tic
All my folks locked down, gotta make it legit
So I'm a spit, and keep my spittin' straight real
I know that you can feel penetentiary steel
Locked down all around for the homies touchin down
When my rags get out you walk a safe ground (walk a safe ground)
'Cause I'm a let them ride killah
You betta stay inside and keep yo shit on yo side nigga
Set trippin' wit me
Because what I see is greenery, and that's all I see
As the day gets older, don't tweak, take a look over your shoulder
Young, dumb, full of fun
Dum diddy dum diddy you'll get done
(Knee-Hi)
Livin' this life
I can't help but dis my dream
Maybe since West anthems (?) I want to roll a beam
Clean, but only had to be a mex
Now hopefully that 850 lookin' spiffy, will come next
I bounced to 120 and Figueroa
Yeah, my house posted across from the store
Just like that hit by the drive way and park in the back
1986 fools is known to jack
Around this click of the hood you found no punks
Many gang bangers, dope fiends and drunks
I learned, bunny hops, still rocks and cops
I ran out of boys with toys
And nights sees on hot days
Just apple sticks on death
RC cola to break a sweat
Now I bet that everybody's comin' up
If you turnin' the wrong street
Lie you bout to get stuck
Now what
(Jayo Felony)
I ain't no muthaufuckin murdera (nigga) I'm a killah
'Cause murderers get life nigga and killaz keep killin'
I'd ratha die with my eyes open
So I can see how these muthafuckaz wanna do me
They set me free bullet loco head with the beat what
And these niggaz know they have to retreat when I speak
The younger dumb wanna have some fun
And drinkin' liqour way before the age of 21
So how you figure that'll never put in work for that hood he love
You never paid him no attention so who should he love
And to keep a strap on him or a phat sack on him
And some bomb but be patrollin the hood
Ran a hoe's name through the mud
And these crooked's stick a strap in your mouth, without a doubt
That's the reason got lost and turned out
He shoulda keep patient
But you was still money chasin
A double life is what that young nigga facin
And all because he was"

Put your eyes on the prize, hitting switches
And getting bitches with plenty riches
And if you bang homie, do that
But when your ass gets slapped with that 25, handle that
And all you see is the glamor and gold
Don't know the other side of the game is where it's scandalous and cold
Your destiny is in your hands, you got control
Wasting time with your life until your ass is old
Trying to be bold, a hog and a pimp
Eighteen years old, HIV in the limp
(Chorus: Butch Cassidy)
Can't fuck with, what you asked for
Sometimes you just should let go
Get what you need and not want
Some folks believe and some don't
These are the ones that don't last
Hard head makes soft ass
But it was something that I had to have
I just had to have
(WC)
What's crackin' gangsta
Little woe G sake with a bang loose
Dickie sagging how should kicking it
Bangs with me, nigga let me swang with you
Hop in this cut dog, and split this game to ya
I see them niggas that got ya tatted and called it paddering
A clutch and a glock, banging on niggas at the bus stop
Putting in work, leave you broke, cloke white shirt
Doing dirt trying to gain strikes for the turf
Loc, what up, shit I knew your brother
You used to bang with him, when you was a little motherfucker
Until they amputated both of my legs, circled the block
Caught your brother slippin' and flippin' the lead
Retaliation was swift, furious, just know this hood shit is serious
For the sake of if remembers, see your 'bout your paper
And remember, loc's success is best with revenge on these haters, nigga
(Chorus: Butch Cassidy)
(WC)
Murder, murder, murder
(Warren G)
I don't wanna die
I'm trying to live, trying to survive
Murder, murder, murder
(WC)
I don't wanna die
I'm trying to live, trying to survive
Niggas done got the game twisted
Yet if these bustas pump 'em up
And just start division, fool listen
Life is like a grab shot
You can either hit the jackpot
Stack a not and get a calf shot
(Warren G)
Live you life homie
Don't get pumped up to dump and get cracked
And moms put a block on the phone
You's a hard motherfucker, but now you all alone
(WC)
All alone in the streets it was on
But hit the leather for penitentery friends gone
Your on your own
(Warren G)
Until the youth, I spit to you
They call me G dub and I spit the truth
(Chorus: Butch Cassidy)
(WC talking to end)"
