0,Cadillac Cars,2006,"Checks, Thugs, and Rock n Roll (2006)",Hip Hop,DMC,"(Chorus 2X: DMC)
The Cadillac cars we're supposed to drive
The supersonic jet we're supposed to fly
Things they advertise we're supposed to buy
But the truth about life is we never die
(DMC)
Up in the morning hit the treadmill
Read the morning paper, get the head filled
Eat a little breakfast for the {?} thrill
My son started illin so I said chill
A man can't live on bread and water alone
But by every word proceding out the microphone
My wife woke up, turned the radio on
My son said daddy, they're playing your song
Just another day in the life life
Coolin with my kids and my wife wife
I got a little problem, I got to solve
You see me seekin' knowledge as the world revolves
You might not care, but I despair
Over which color shell-toe Adidas to wear
But that's all right, hey that's okay
'Cause it's the same little problem that I have every day
(DMC)
The L-I-E, is {?} again
And life is a battle, will I ever win?
And you know what they say, over in L.A.
That the four-oh-five is the same damn way
People don't realize we're really alike
But they like to see things in black and white
But they don't know, we're all the same
It's all about your throw and how you play, the game
People think times won't be so hard
If they just get down, and pray to God
But I came here, to keep it real
You gotta do a whole lot more than just kneel
Don't hesitate to investigate
Take time out, to meditate
As long as I see things goin' on
I'm gonna keep spreadin knowledge with a song, now
(DMC)
I walk outside to my pickup truck
I see the five-oh and I say whassup?
Mr. McDaniels what's goin' on?
Are you workin out 'cause you're lookin' kinda strong
I try to keep the mental and the physical
Correct in respect to my spiritual
I try to keep the message really clear for you
So listen to the questions that I'm askin you
Do you believe, in rock'n'roll?
'Cause if you do it'll save your soul
It helps you gain when you lose control
If you believe in rock'n'roll
(DMC)
Rock rock rock rock rockin' on heaven's door
Rock rock rock rock rockin' till I can't no more"
1,Cold,2006,"Checks, Thugs, and Rock n Roll (2006)",Hip Hop,DMC,"(Sped up vocal sample)
It's collllllllllld! Col-hoh-ollllld
Collld cold, in this big city babe
Ah but that don't bother - cold, in this big city babe {*2X*}
Ah but that don't bother me {*repeat ""me""*}
(Chorus: sung)
I see the tears in your eye and your heart may cry
To my niggaz locked down it's gon' be all right
To my sisters in the hood tryin' to make life better
You ain't by yourself, you're looking better
Whatever the storms that come
Life is full of them
Take a look in the mirror at yourself
Believe in yourself, yeah
(Verse One: Jade)
Now I, understand that man gotta meet his quota but damn
Is it because I'm tan that you pull me over
My man, he gotta hustle 'cause he can't get a job
Slam the door in his face, because he caught a juvie case
It seems as if I got people tryin' to pull me down
Red broads intimidatin insinuatin and hatin'
I'm a young buck, keepin' on a young tuck
Waitin for the next move, zippin up and lace shoes
And you niggaz tryin' to get at me, uh-uh I never sweat B
This world is chilly but Willies could never catch me
Although you wasn't ready still ridin' for you already
Make me wanna crack a vanilla dutch and smoke heavy
Oh, regardless you could come and holla at the O girl
The streets raised me so I'm ready for this cold world
You think you know but you have no idea
I'm never slippin, never runnin', here I go right here, c'mon
(Sped up sample)
Ah but that don't bother - cold, in this big city babe {*3X*}
Ah but that don't bother me {*repeat ""me""*}
(Verse Two: DMC)
I be the microphone talker, the big street walker
Known to rock a rhyme, a bonafide New Yorker
O.G. godfather, like Afrika Bambaataa
DMC comes harder, 'cause he gotta be smarter
Growin' up in the city I can't be dum diddy dumb
I'd rather be sittin' pretty than in a city like a bum
I roll with some killers, some real bug niggaz
And some real ill figures that ain't scared to pull the trigger
My homies all dead, in jail or doin' life
While the honies give us his and we treat 'em like a wife
There's a whole lot of shootin, and executin
And the crew keeps gettin' stronger 'cause we keep on recruitin
We can never die, we just multiply
We keep the records in the store for the streets to buy
Peace to Eazy-E, Biggie and Tupac
Rest in peace Keith, Cowboy and Scott LaRock
(Verse Three: Sonny Black)
Can you tell me baby why the world is so cold
Why is Hennessy the only thing that warm my soul
Into the belly of the beast, I watch the hood cry
Gangsters bangin' out I'm seein good niggaz die
The world is so cold, yeah I can feel the breeze
Hatred is sacred, life's a dying disease
Livin' to hustle, down to die for cheese
Just hustlin with muscle slugs are flyin with ease
Behind bars baby I seen the world is even colder
It seems like the weight of the world is on your shoulder
Life moves along like the hands of time
Death brings life and life brings crime
Dyin' is easy, but lifes tend to stress me
Livin' through sin hopin God will bless me
And forgive me and save my soul
What he from heaven cause the world is so cold
Like (""cold... cold... cold.."")"

(DMC)
Come together, make the world better
Be like Run and D, ""Tougher Than Leather""
Choose a charity, give up the cheddar
Fight poverty, make a vendetta
Love mother nature, don't upset her
Let the trees in the rainforest keep gettin' wetter
Don't kick the puppy, you better pet her
Don't really need to make the mink into a sweater
Leave the bird alone, don't harm a feather
How do they turn a cow into leather
Like JDL on stage with the meta
Don't got no dough, better be a go-getter
Is that anthrax? Watch out for the letter
Mother Theresa was cool, even though I never met her
I'm not the follower, I be the trendsetter
We can make the world better if we just come together
Come together... right now, now (3X)
Come together... right now
(Rev Run)
For all you sucker MC's perpetratin the fraud

Came together with my fella DMC once more
This ain't back in the day, we're still stackin the pay
And still rockin' to Jay, it's okay now
So forever we'll stay, the most superior trey
Hip-Hop hooray, give it away now
So what'chu wanna do? Got a calibre
To make it top dollar, Hollis is the crew

Wait a minute, WAIT A

I'm just an MC, that's all that I be
I speak freely, clearly, you see
The people in the world, they all know me
So why sometimes I feel so lonely?
From a place and a time, that y'all forgot
But you wanna remember me cause my man got shot
Life is hard, so I gotta be strong
I gotta keep it right so I can't go wrong
I write rhymes, Gemini my sign
I got a nine I don't rhyme about mine
I spit, it's legit, never stopped by cops
Comin up with the hits when the records (*""DROP!*"")
My name's DMC, I said I'm great
I still say it now with no debate
Confuscious states, (*speech reversed*)
I gotta believe in somethin more than that
I gotta believe in somethin more than this
I gotta believe in somethin more than that
Fresh new kicks and the old black hat

I'm tryin to find my place in the sun
Never lived by the gun I never ran from one

(Find my way, find my way in the sun)
(In the sun, in the sun, ey I'm gonna find my way)
(DMC)
The life that I live isn't make believe
You know who I am I wear it on my sleeve
Took a little trip down to Detroit
Whippin the whip down the strip like a A.J. Foyt
Makin hip-hop that's been my job
I know a kid that rocks and his name is Bob
It's a long race and I'm winnin son
Sippin on beers eatin veni-son
I can't take back, the things I've done
I know I'm fuckin up but I'm havin fun
I'm on the road, I'm gettin old
20 plus years so the story goes
Fly-ass pro, the (?) know
Who gets to stay, who gots to go
I gotta believe in somethin more than that
I gotta believe in somethin more than this
I gotta believe in somethin more than that
Like Johnny Cash I'm the man in black
I'm tryin to find my place in the sun
Never lived by the gun I never ran from one
I'm tryin to find my place in the sun
Never lived by the gun I never ran from one
(You know I'll find my way, find my way)
(Find my way, find my way in the sun)

She's a freaky chick believe me
She dances on the TV
Watch me, watch me, paparazzi
I'm, so, cute
(DMC)
She's on the movie screen
In all the magazines
She Benz's and she bings
She's gonna get all your cream
She dreams of money cream
She dress so fresh and clean
A shopaholic thing
She is a beauty queen
Just like Mary uh what's her name
Things ain't changed she still the same
Remember those things she used to do
Remember that song I sung to you
Remember that story I used to tell
About Mary cold buggin and +Raising Hell+
She's freaky as, as freaky gets
When it comes to chicks she's freakiest
(DMC)
Now I know Mary and I know Jane
They both are freaks then who's to blame?
Jane, always, looks for Dick
She like Dick cause Dick a trick
She left Dick and went with Rick
This caused beef with Keith and Mick
Now who is she sleepin' with?
It's a story that the tabloids got to get
All the rapper dudes, wanna hit it
All the actor dudes, wanna hit it
It's a well known fact but they won't admit it
When they knock them boots they all know who did it
(DMC)
So sexy, and she's freaky {*8X*}
Hit her one time you'll fall in love
She'll be the one you're always thinkin' of
That's one piece you've got to get
That's one piece you've got to hit
She's one freak you won't forget
Might be a move you might regret
She's so fine, she's so hot
And if you want her she wants a lot
That's okay if you don't mind
One thing's for sure you'll have a good time
It's all right, it's okay
She don't want you anyway
It's all right, it's okay
You can get it but you got to pay
It's all right, it's okay
She don't want you anyway
It's all right, it's okay
You can spend the night but you can't stay
So sexy, and she's freaky {*4X*}"
5,Good Bye,2006,"Checks, Thugs, and Rock n Roll (2006)",Hip Hop,DMC,"(Feat. Lil Mizzo)

Goodbye (And I would never ever say)
Goodbye (Yo yo yo yeah, uh, yeah... and I would never ever say)
Goodbye (Woo - and I would never ever say)
Bye bye (I gotta, I gotta)
(DMC)
Yo yo, who know the game like me, who seen it change like me
I'm the MC'n O.G. from the N.Y.C.
And I ain't never leave the streets, the ghetto made me conscious
And I've been doin' it since you rappin' cats was still in diapers
But it seems to me these cats are gettin' too big for their britches
And they're barkin up the wrong tree, callin my women bitches
I remember - when we used to rhyme in the park
But things have changed, now they bustin' shots after dark
Now that's a shame - these youngsters see me in the streets
Ask me O.G. how you do it make it seem like nothin' to it
Well I never lost a dream, the hustle's still inside of me
And never even departed me, this rap shit didn't father me
I gave birth to a lot of MC's on this earth
But they're too blind to recognize the truth and it hurts
What would you do if I said goodbye and watched the game crumble
But believe me, they tease me, this rap shit needs me
(Chorus minus some ad libs)
(DMC)
I see you, Lil Mizzo
Tell you somethin', check it
(Lil Mizzo)
Aiyyo I never leave the game, how could I
When there's so much to accomplish than bein broke and stuck in the projects
Come through in a green M-3, niggaz dickridin
Like ""Damn, how he do a song with DMC?""
Don't worry about it, just know I'm in the game now
He was such a cute kid, why he sellin cocaine now
But struggling's past tense, I'm rappin' now, bought myself a house
With a swimming pool, backyard and a glass fence
There's no time for celebration, mind elevation
If you ain't searchin for money what the hell are you chasin?
Go against ICU I'll put this barrel to your back
You know who this is, Lil Mizzo and Darryl Mack
I been a man since I got in the hood, flow so much niggaz get jealous
Like I can't stand when he drop his hood
How could you not respect Run-D.M.C.
For bein the first rappers to get they handprints in Hollywood
They deserve the respect of a legend, and I'm tryin' hard
I can be the best rapper in less than a second
I'm takin' over the industry, everybody knows us
I'm only 17 but my mind is all grown up, so whassup
(Chorus - same as before)
(DMC)
I would never leave the game my people love me too much
Because rap is my baby and I watched it grow up
Man I'm still here breathin, my eyes seein
That these rapper cats deceivin, so don't believe 'em
They got the nerve to rap about cars and iced out jewels
Man you rented it from Jacob you ain't foolin me or schoolin D
On how to MC, I be the pick of the litter
I've been in the game many years but I'll still spit a winner
Champ my people from the streets in Queens know I'm a hitter
Knockin' balls out the park, gettin' physically fitter
Don't duck too slow and don't jump too fast
I roll with young soldiers who put a foot in your ass
They be the new sensation, the next generation
Hollis Queens, Dirty Jersey, California situation
If I kiss the game goodbye, before I leave
I would go and fix some fake MC's, I'm signin out DMC
Goodbye
(Chorus - same as before)"
6,Just Like Me,2006,"Checks, Thugs, and Rock n Roll (2006)",Hip Hop,DMC,"(DMC)
As I walk through the corners of Cooley High
I gotta be thankful that I'm still alive
I have a lot of thoughts like who the hell am I
What is the truth and what is a lie?
But I think about my life and everything is okay
I gotta pave the way to a brighter day
'Cause it's really plain and simple when it came to me
There's a lot of people just like me (like me)
There's a whole lot just like me (like me)

1964, uh! Here we go, aiyyo
The child was born it was a beautiful day
It was 1964, the 31st of May
The girl gave birth to a baby boy
He's not a burden, he's a bundle of joy
She was just a young girl in her youth
And her parents tried real hard to hide the truth
Is there a chance for the baby to live?
That is a chance that you gotta give
That is a chance that you gotta give

It was 9 whole months inside of the womb
Another long month in the hospital room
Facin doom in a tomb cause the kid is alone
But somebody came along and they took the kid home
He came into the world like we all do
But he never ever knew how he came through
Do the best you can do if this happen to you
And understand all the words that I'm rappin' to you
And understand all the words that I'm rappin' to you

We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then

Father is, the mother and the father is...
Yo, the mother and the father is all that he knows
They give him lots of love and you know that it shows
He's livin' really well he has all that he needs
He came into the world and he's gonna succeed
It is a blessing to live in the light
If nothing is wrong then something is right
They say that life is a mystery
And I just wanna know my history
Understand that life is good to me
That's the way it is so (let it be)
My life is complete, everything is all right
Life is good to me, I'm in paradise
Understand when I'm rappin', no pain and sorrow
I just want you to know, yo yo
I just want you to know, yo yo
I'm all right ma
I'm all right pa... na na na

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon

When you comin' home, I don't know when
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home, I don't know when
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home, I don't know when
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home, I don't know when

Cause this you never saw, on any dancefloor
I had plenty viewers with some band in Aruba
15 thousand, it looked so astoundin
The bass was pounded, my voice surroundin
Not a video, actual live show
I seen hands in the air, on HBO
'Cause it's Naughty By Nature, female emancipator
Nuff backshots, what's a movie without a plot
Starring, DMC and his man Doug E.
Yo how they lookin' D? (They're lookin' real sexy)

Lovey dovey, the ladies are lovely

I won't play the role like all the fake thugs be
When I ""Walk This Way"" they always wanna hug me
Walkin' down the street, watchin ladies
They amaze me, even the ones with the babies
All the fools in the club, are gonna go crazy
Uh-huh, they love lookin' at all the lovely ladies
La-di-da-di, we like to party
We love all the lovely ladies shakin their bodies
Her friend is a 10, but she's a hottie
She got a good attitude, and she never act snotty
Ladies Love Cool J, and we love the ladies
It's only right, to fit in my Mercedes
Lovey dovey, the ladies are lovely

8,Only God Knows,2006,"Checks, Thugs, and Rock n Roll (2006)",Hip Hop,DMC,"(Chorus 2X: DMC)
The wife, the kids, the things, I did
I'm lookin' at my life and how I lived
Is it negative, is it positive
Only God knows what it really is
(DMC)
My wife's mad at me 'cause I'm drinkin' again
Comin' home with my breath stinkin again
Got me goin' down the drain, got me sinkin again
All the alcohol got me thinkin' again
If I take my own life that's suicide
I think about the nights I laid down and cried
I think about the brothers who already died
And I took so many drugs now my brain is fried
When I walk through the streets God is my guide
I always try to run but I just can't hide
Won't talk to the preacher cause the preacher lied
I asked for salvation and I was denied
Listen up everybody this is Darryl's song
I'm tryin' to figure out what's right and wrong
I'm lookin' at the world and do I belong
And like Marvin Gaye said, ""What's Going On?""
(DMC)
When I'm alone in my room starin' at the wall
I hear all the ghosts walkin' in the hall
Voices in the head keep talkin' to me
What's fantasy, what's reality
They say go in the kitchen, and grab the knife
Kill the kids, kill the wife
Turn it on yourself and take your own life
And I know, I know, I know that ain't right
But let me tell you somethin' it gets deeper than that
I'm lookin' for where the Grim Reaper is at
I knocked on his door he said come on in
And by the way you shoulda brought a friend
I said no, it's me, myself and I
And not too many people want to die
I'm sittin' in my living room talkin' to Death
Tryin' to figure out, what I got left
(Interlude: DMC)
Aiyyo man, you see that gun over there man
You need to pick it up and use it on yourself
Nah nah I ain't ain't gon' do that
Well then, you should take it outside and
Y'know you got a bullet with everybody's name on it
Ah let me think about it man, let me just take a walk ah
Yo, who dat comin'?
(DMC)
When I left the Grim Reaper, I ran into Christ
He said DMC you could walk on ice
Remember those times that you never fell
God was holdin' you up, man couldn't you tell
I kept you cock diesel just like LL
Strong with a ""Message"" like Melle Mel
When things was bad, you was doin' fine
You did a good job of not losin your mind
You even read the bible like a hundred times
The meaning of life is not hard to find
Take a look around, look into yourself
You know where to go when you need help
And all those times you thought you was alone
It was you, yourself and that microphone
So don't give up, keep writin those rhymes
You're makin' a way for a better mankind
{*Ad lib scratches to end*}"

By the way Jay rest in peace
'Cause I'ma make sure that we all can eat
So don't try to hand me yo' card
Fuck you and your pussy-ass bodyguard
Don't give a fuck about the fancy car
And the fact that you like buyin out the bar
By the way, who the fuck do they think they are?
Punk executives tryin' to act like stars
The bullshit, has got to quit
Cause me and my street soldiers gonna break yo' shit
(DMC - repeat 2X)
Smile in your face and talk and alla that
And when you get the story, it's never exact
They say that you're friends but they really are not
Cause everything that you did, they simply forgot
{Don't lie}
(DMC)
It's gon' be all right
Y'all seen the movie
Jason LIVES!
We ain't gon' never die!
Can't kill us
Kings for eternity!"

Force set up the hip-hop police
Can't find peace in the Middle East
Some punk rapper always gots to beef
What's goin' on with all the priests
Church should be shamed about what they did
First PlayStation never touched the kids
This revelation is a prophecy
The only way out is you and me
We gotta sit and wait then go to sleep
The promise of the kids I gotta keep
Life is rough enough on the street
I gotta make sure that we all can eat
Chuck said rap is like CNN
We keep tunin out instead of tunin in
And while we're sleepin' they're watchin us
And instead of watchin them we're not wakin' up
(Josh Todd from Buckcherry)
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the Joker to the King
There's too much con-fu-sion
I can't get no relief
(DMC)
It's easy for D to be the all-time great
And now I be the one they'll assassinate
I'm talkin' on the topic and I'm talkin' truth
'Cause I know knowledge can save the youth
Here's how the dollars need to be used
We got a choice to save the schools
Billionaires, millionaires and trillionaires
They say that the money is never there
Tell me the truth, tell me you don't care
You profit off the music and the clothes I wear
You gettin' that money, yeah that's all good
You ain't doin' a damn thing for the hood
You ain't doin' anything you know you should
You ain't doin' anything you know you could
It be the dollar dollar dollar and you gotta gotta lotta
But you don't know what hip-hop means to Bambaataa
(Josh Todd from Buckcherry)
No reason to get excited
The thief he got exposed
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
{*Long interlude and guitar solo*}
(Josh Todd from Buckcherry)
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Them and servants too, yeah all right
(DMC: repeat 6X)
This revelation is a prophecy
The only way out is you and me"

(Chorus: singers - repeat 4X)
What's wrong with this world today (what's wrong with this world)
(DMC)
Check it out now
12 years old and I'm smokin' on weed
I want a lot of stuff that I don't really need
14 years old and I'm drinkin' on beer
What my parents gotta say I don't wanna hear
16 years old and I'm takin' ecstasy
Girl next to me is gonna have sex with me
18 years old and I'm sniffin cocaine
Don't really care what it's doin' to my brain
(Singers)
Don't understand, why all the fuss
Why the grown-ups keep messin with us
I'm not gonna die just because I smoked dust
Smack me in the face just because I said a cuss
Treat 'em like kids, we should leave them alone
But they don't understand (I'm 12 and I'm grown)
(Napoleon)
At the age of 12 I was probably sellin weed
Seein the same things that DMC seen
Was a young cat that'd love to see you bleed
But what's goin' on with this world tell me
Kids in the street eatin meals off the streets
Take me off the streets but can't stop the streets
At the age of 3 they got shot right in front of me
My moms and my daddy, shoulda never had me
16 years old my balls got swoll
Heart got cold and them glocks got load
Take it back to 15, pops was on the scene
Took me out the hood, showed me how to stack cream
Take it back to my breddern, age 11
Khadafi, the head brother, of Makaveli
Wasn't for you, the streets woulda failed me
Napoleon, Outlaw, give 'em hell DMC
(DMC)
Check it out
Today is the day that I bring a gun to school
The teacher dissed me and he played me for a fool
Tryin' to play the role, tryin' to be cool
Being {?} well I make the rules
(Napoleon)
If I pull the trigger, I figure if he die
I say that I'm crazy, you know that's a lie
(DMC)
Just gotta act like I'm out of my mind
To be on the news, on the cover of Time
(Napoleon)
Shoulda known I would do it, shoulda seen the signs
Been lovin' guns ever since I was 9
(DMC) I played PlayStation
(Nap) And Nintendo too
(DMC) And love all the games
(Nap) When I'm shootin at you
(DMC) When my dad was young he used to go out and hunt
(Nap) It doesn't really matter man, I came to front
(Both)
It doesn't really matter as a kid or a man
Cause the same thing can happen with a gun in your hand
