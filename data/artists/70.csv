We don't care if you're 8 to 10 or if you're a senior citizen because we've got a beat that just won't end
So you better get ready to rock my friend
You see, we got some news that you can use, an offer that you can't refuse
We're givin' a party and you've got to come because you're the one
Red, yellow, black, white or brown, in our own way, we can knock it down
Just take your time and enjoy yourself and you rock as good, as anyone else
C'mon yo do it, put your body into it
If the feeling is good, you might as well do it
See it makes no sense just standing around
Just boogie to the beat of the funky sound
You don't rock with us, you won't have a ball
We might as well didn't rock at all
You see, we can't rock if you don't have fun 'cause you're the one that's number one
Now raise your hand up above your head (C'mon) if you agree with what I said
Just (Wave) wave jour hands all in the air, somebody say ""Oh Yeah"" (Oh yeah)
Flash, one time
Melle Mel with the clientele, I'm gonna rock your chime and ring your bell
See I'm so bad and I'm so light, a lot of rhyme on a dime to make the world turn twice

I'm slick, I'm cool, I'm solid gold, they call me the Kid Creole
I'm the C.O.W.B.O.Y. (Why?), the man's so bad that you can't deny
And when you act the Cowboy to play, I'm Cowboy, I never ran away

Full grown, he's a one of a kind and Flash is gonna rock your mind huh
Flash two times
Beat, beat, you in the crew, hold it
Why don't you find somebody and party?
I like this part
Get down
Hold up, hold up
Quickly now, quickly now
The bass was in your face
??? The highs will get your mate to rise???
Young ladies in the place
Feel the highs, feel the bass
If you wanna rock till the break of dawn somebody say, ""Come on"" (come on)
Melle Mel, right on time, it's Taurus, the bull, my zodiac sign
I'm mister Ness and I'm ready to go and I go by the sign of Scorpio
My name is Raheim, I don't like to fuss, my zodiac sign is Aquarius
The Kid Creole is the name of mine and Plaices is my zodiac sing
And I'm Cowboy and I'm running this show, my zodiac sign is Virgo
And Grandmaster Flash cut so on, his zodiac sign is Capricorn
We're gonna try something new
What you're gonna do?
We're gonna try something new
What you're gonna do?
Now that you heard our name and signs, put your name into this rhyme
What's your name?
I said, ""What's you name?""
We're gonna try something else
Go for it yourself
We're gonna try something else
Go for it yourself
Gonna try this game one more time
Now this time use your zodiac sign
What's your sign?
I said ""What's your sign""

Flash, two times
Beat, beat, you and the crew, hold it
Why don't you find somebody?"

And we're chosen to rule
The deans of clean inside the cool school
We're the chiefs of relief
Contained by wild beasts
The finesse of the West, the masterpiece of the East
Hah, the boss of course
As the lord of our fort
The ones with the platinum vocal chords
We're the science of desire
With a magical mic
The monarch of the dark in the night all right
We advertise
And specialize
In the exercise and we'll energize
The young ladies thighs
Cause all the fly guys
Nature's to rise right before their eyes
We're the Earl of the world
And the Air of flair
The Duke of dare, the Mayor of debonaire
Got fine, drink wine
Can dance and dine
Got a first class female oh so fine
Hey baby, whatever you doin' right girl
I just want you to always be easy, and keep on shakin that thing
And I want you - swingin' it swingin' it swingin'
Tell me how now
Like dy-na-mite before it blows
Who needs a band when the beat just goes - boom!
He's Grandmaster, he cuts faster
We're the Furious, serious, and ever so mysterious
Five that's rockin' the house
And everybody say PLAY (PLAY)
Say PLAY (PLAY) well OK!

'Cause I am the man they call Scorpio
I like fly girls that don't say no
Hey girl, grab my hand, hold on tight
Don't you worry 'bout a thing Raheem'll do you right
I'm a mint that's fresh huh, a woman's pet
There ain't a thing in the world that I can't get
In the history books or the picture show
It's the golden voice on your radio
I'm the rapper never printed voice is solid gold
I'm playin' the role, they call me Kid Creole
And I'm the, the Romeo, of the nasty show
All the ladies in the place, to my house we go

?Huh huh, zmapel, Melle Mel? (I have no idea what Melle Mel says)
?Ah dome mal lamate mademoiselle?
?Done wa sing, done marseis?
?Done wa rik no dees!?
I'm seein this girl that I just adore
I'm seein this girl that what I never saw before
The way she was swaying and doing the swing
I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
And I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess
Raheem, in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to, on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Raheem
Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin' on my steez
Only one fine lady that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game
Well I'ma, Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody wanna rock rock rock
Gonna do it to the East, wanna do it to the West
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest
Grandmaster Flash, is willing and able
He's the king of the cuts on two turntables
He's the GRAND, GRAND, the master man
He's so nice with his hands he don't need no band
Rocks 45's, and 33's
Rocks boys men women and young ladies
He can slice so precise it's almost fun
And he makes better love than a mick makes money

9,The Message,1982,The Message (1982),,Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five,"It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ha-ha-ha-ha
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Standing on the front stoop, hangin out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
A crazy lady, livin in a bag
Eating out of garbage piles, used to be a fag-hag
Said, she danced the tango, skipped the light fandango
Was circon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got Social Security
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ha-ha-ha-ha
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
My brothers doin' bad, stole my mothers TV
Says, she watches to much, is just not healthy
""All my children"" in the daytime, ""Dallas"" at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon king kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A midrange migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
My son said, ""daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
I dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed the arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park, 'cause it's crazy after the dark
Keep my hand on the gun, 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like an outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say you want some more, livin on a seesaw
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
A child is born, with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you go through
You grow in the ghetto, living second rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The place that you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alley way
You'll admire all the number book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpockets, peddlers and even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, I'm no fool
But then you wind up dropping out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null 'n void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stickup kid, look what you done did
Got send up for a eight year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a may tag
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
Being used and abused and served like hell
Till one day you was found hung dead in a cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young
So, don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh"
