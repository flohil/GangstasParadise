0,...and He Gets the Girl,2006,Food & Liquor (2006),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"Hold It Now!
I'm just gonna walk up to her and say ""Hi""
That's all you gotta do, is say ""Hi"" (Grab Her!)
Aight? C'mon, Hold it now!
Well, I know I'm not the coolest and this might sound kind of foolish
'Cause I know I'm not the smoothest told myself I shouldn't do this
'Cause I'm not very well suited not the popularest of students
We ain't in the same crowd I always see you with the hoopers
But we got the same lunch, you might see me with the cooler
That's 'cause I don't eat pork, you can never be shook up
Oh, you like Linkin Park, that's the hat from the tour
I got an autographed shirt they wrote ""Much Love To Ya""
Man, its really funny how we like the same music
But I really love jazz I was gonna play the tuba
I tried to join the band they said I was really really bad
Didn't really make me sad, I'm used to being a loser
But you, I think you're super, so much I had to pursue ya
I don't believe the things they say on the football team rumors
The quarterback can't spell, I'm his after school tutor
I just took a cue from cupid, but now I think its stupid, I'm sorry...
And then I walked away, think that she'll never talk to me
Like, what were you thinking bringing up the band,
You wouldve gotten a better result if you'd beat her up and ran
You shouldn't've wore your glasses, take your shirt up out your pants
So now it's all over, you won't get another chance, Damn...
I was so close to her, then I felt a hand on my shoulder
She say I know you're not the coolest but I swear you are the cutest
And I know you play the tuba, I seen you at the recitals
It takes alot to get up there and embarrass yourself
But you shouldn't put down, you should merit yourself
That just mean you're not a punk, I like Thelonius Monk
He's the wallpaper on my computer, I love Final Fantasy
I hate first-person shooters, Meteora was nice, but I bought Hybrid Theory twice
Half the cheerleading squad is in a stupor, the only reason I do it is cause my mother took state when she was a junior
And she want me to do the same, so I'm like *sigh*
I wanna be an oncologist and diagnose tumors
I got a pet parrot his name is Mr. Tuna, my favorite food is fish remember that for the future
My IM name is Miss Luna, you can hit me up at 6...
How you feelin' man?..Yes... Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes!
Come Seymour, we have things to doo!
That was wonderful, you did things to me, you've never done before
Ah! You're that nerd!
Yeah...
You were wonderful!
Thanks..."
1,Adoration of the Magi,2015,Tetsuo & Youth (2015),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"You're so smart, you're like a contemporary museum of art
That farts, that's harsh
Narcissism, on narcotics
On sharp objects in large pockets
At dark, you ain't gotta hide it
Keep it metal gear solid
Lead the leaders, that's how you file it then clobber it
Low on energy, find peach cobbler then gobble it
Yeah, it's food in them drums and boxes
If you beat 'em up then they'll drop it
And they'll rapidly flicker till they disappear
Blinking gradually quickens till they isn't here
And that's da da da da da da da
Just to be back in
Reincarnated, exact twin
Exact ten, exact twelve, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, exact self
Do I really gotta say it?
Didn't we all play it?
Dojo, Abobo
Over shoulder throw, polo
Billy, Jimmy even on the low low
Why you ready to die? You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby
(These Magi adore you, these Magi adore you)
Why you wanna be born again? You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby
Now let's vogue, mountain pose
Downward facing dog, warrior pose
Tree pose, bridge pose
Triangle pose, seated twist (Pose, pose)
Upward facing dog (Pose, pose), pigeon pose
In this bitch, that's vulgar, that's yoga
Let's try it again with clothes
And closer, enclosure, exposures
Quiet is kept like Rosicrucian meet Cosa Nostras on Oprah's sofa with both controllers
Watchin' Gazans and Ashkenazzis ride roller coasters, say yeah
Yeah, lots of options, now up is down, two player
Now A is jump and B is punch, you seein' somethin' that weren't there
To find friendliness in a nemesis, it's a old test
Three buttons, see somethin', that's emphasis on genesis
Why you ready to die? You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby
(These Magi adore you, these Magi adore you)
Why you wanna be born again? You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby
Can't be eyes closed when you side scroll
You not the first person, the first person
From your first curse until your first cursive
And your curse words is in the curve version
It occurs virgin is the word version that refers perfect to the first person
In the third verse, who's really me in the third person but prefers the first one, that's me again
Master cleanse and a syringe
From a gerber until your first burger, pamper to her depends
Everything between is just drawers, even in between is no loss
Even where the king is no boss, meet it with a swing it's so south, yeah
Unless you Bamm Bamm, knocking them pitches into the grand stands
In the club, watching the women just do them hand stands like you a man's man
That's washing down a ham with the Zam Zam
Who got a baby in here with these strippers?
She's two weeks pregnant
Didn't even know, he's dancing with her, damn
Why you ready to die? You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby
(These Magi adore you, these Magi adore you)
Why you wanna be born again? You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby"
2,All Black Everything,2011,Lasers (2011),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"You would never know
If you could ever be
If you never try
You would never see
Stayed in Africa
We ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn't he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything
(Lupe Fiasco-Verse 1)
Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't feared so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by the W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions, civil war got avoided
Little black sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as a old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by bill o'reilly who read from the Quran
President bush sends condolences from Iran
Where fox news reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins Mandela peace prize
(Lupe Fiasco-Verse 2)
Uh, and it ain't no projects
Keepin' it real is not an understood concept
Yeah, complexions not a contest
'Cause racism has no context
Hip-hop ain't got a section called conscious
Everybody rappin' like crack never happened
Crips never occurred nor bloods to attack them
Matter a fact no hood to attack in
Somalia is a great place to relax in
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin
The rat pack was cool group of black men
That inspired the five white guys called the jacksons
Eminem fitted in but then again he inspired a black rapper tryin' to mimic him
And that's a really rose up out of michigan, the sign of white rapper by the name of 50 cent
(Lupe Fiasco-Verse 3)
Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy
I cordially invite you to ask why can't it be
Now we can do nothing 'bout the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make fast or we can make it last
Every woman queenin' and every man a kingin'
When those color lines come we can't seen between
We just close our eyes till it's all black everything"
3,American Terrorist,2006,Food & Liquor (2006),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"Uh, close your mind, close your eyes, see with your heart

The ink of a scholar is worth a thousand times more than the blood of a martyr
Terrorist
We came through the storm
Nooses on our necks, and a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747 on the Pentagon lawn-wake up!
The alarm clock is connected to a bomb
Anthrax lab on a West Virginia farm
Shorty ain't learned to walk, already heavily armed
Civilians and lil' children is especially harmed
Camouflage Torahs, Bibles, and glorious Qu'rans
The books that take you to heaven and let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpreted reasons for warfare
We read 'em with blind eyes, I guarantee you there's more there
Rich must be blind 'cause they ain't see the poor there! ...Yeah
Need to open up a park, just close 10 schools, we don't need them
Can you please call the fire department, they down here marchin' for freedom
Burn down all they tepees, turn the TVs on to teach them, and move!

Now a poor Klu Klux man see that we all brothers
Not 'cause things the same, but 'cause we lack the same color
And that's green, now that's mean
Can't burn his cross, 'cause he can't afford the gasoline
Now if a Muslim woman's strapped with a bomb on the bus
With the seconds runnin' give you the jitters
Just imagine an American-based Christian organization
Plannin' to poison water supplies to bring the Second Coming quicker
Nigga, they ain't livin' properly
Break 'em off with a lil' democracy
Turn they whole culture to a mockery
Give 'em Coca-Cola for they property
Give 'em gum, give 'em guns, get 'em young, give 'em fun
But if they ain't givin' it up, then they ain't gettin' none
And don't give 'em all, naw, man, just give 'em some
It's the paper, some of these cops must be Al-Qaeda, nigga, uh!

Said she was a fan of mine
Knew she was new jersey, but said that she was Anaheim
Butterflies turn to suicides, now its phantoms flyin
Used to whisper in my ear, but now she tryna vandal mine
That holy feelin' all gone, slowly feelin' all wrong
None of this is satisfyin, pull it over, let me out, ill just hitch hike back to mine
Nothings really as it seems, yeah I shoulda known that
Thought I called a angel, devils had my phones tapped"
5,Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free),2012,Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1 (2012),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"First off say peace to Pine Ridge
Shame on all the damage the white man wine did
Ghost dance, Trail of Tears, 5 million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a 9 stripper mad dash
A friend request following a hash tag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
Cause that's just more dinosaur for the Cadillac
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way
And we marvel at the state of heart of man
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say its highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you paquino
I go as left as a heart in the chest
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way
An all white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus day up off the calendar
South Central an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in spa 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It's parts of Manilla like the video for Thriller
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
Then what's the flavor of the Sunday preacher's pedophilia
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave but nowhere in the middle
Of the extremes of America's dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, naaa
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way"

Ghettos, America. U.S. to the izzay
Killa in the citywide sprizzay
Where there's sunshine in the shizzade
Church won't pull him out the pin like a grenade
For acting out their fears like a charade
Till they blackin' out their tears like it's lights out
Bring 'em out the black like a lighthouse
And wave to 'em before they wiped out
Lifesaver, threw em, hope they catch it
But it's so Titanic to be iced out
That's just scratching the surface like triple axels
Want to roll around that Bentley like Crystal Castles
In addition to the chain
That's just to take the attention from the pain
Or is it the mission of the man
Audubon Ballroom, Motel Lorraine
Now white people, they can't say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people, we're not niggas
God made us better than that
No break, ah wait
Little mayhem for your All-State, nay ham, all steak
Get a good ball great like a golf grade
Make the ball break
Just one swing, no putting
That's how I try 'n' does things always
Especially when your past is
Martin, Baldwin, Audubon Ballroom
Turn the glass ceiling to a glass floor
Make a trampoline out of trapdoor
On that gasoline when I was back poor
Now they crafted out my dream underneath a tap floor
Backpack battle-cat underground rap lore
Anonymous but dominant - what's a Mac to a hacker
In other words, lyrical Zuckerbergs
Pimp you may move a mouse but what's a rat to a cat store
It's like a gig to an app store
I rap Black history, you can only see my past if you fast forward
Now white people, they can't say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people, we're not niggas
God made us better than that
Black Panthers, black anthems, black blues
With black answers for black stanzas: Langston Hughes
Breaking rules, ain't it cool?
Took it old, and made it new
Black painters, musical black anger
Black mothers, beautiful black anchors
So let's hear it for 'em! Let's hear it for 'em!
Let's hear it for 'em! Let's hear it for 'em!
Black America! Trap America!
80s Babies! Crack America!
Rap America! Bad as Erykah!
From the era of family tearing up
But we just won big, can't be undid
Form a whole culture in just one kid
Miami dope boys, Oakland militants
Harlem Renaissance it's our deliverance
Now white people, they can't say nigga
So I gotta take it back
Now black people, we're not niggas
God made us better than that"

Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners
Murals that salute freedom or death for liberty
Be it Inglewood or Egypt, Bedstuy or Baghdad
Syria or Liberia, the west bank or the west side of Chicago
Where food and liquor stores still occupy the block
While police and community watchmen justify why they shot
Emmit Till and Malice Green, Rekia Boyd and Trayvon Martin
Better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton
Or whatever they sellin in your food desert
Cause your soul is dessert and will be dissected and consumed
On the Fox evening news while we sing the blues
The new Jim Crow caged bird sings
'Cause he's tired of occupying his misery and of our marching
He wanna fly to a higher consciousness
But his school on academic probation
They gave him medicine, diagnosed him with a felony and mental retardation
So he refuses to cease the firin, nobody's hirin
In Illinois, 67 is the new age when you retirin
Class lines have blurred, those who used to have, have not
Pensions bein snatched
Those who never have keep their hands stretched
Social services being cut
Sterilization clinics giving out pills to numb the womb
Young girls referring to their vaginas as tombs
Thinkin' protests are temporary and trendy
Well rock a t-shirt and carry a poster
And two weeks later it's back to normal
But they say times are changin'
The revolution is becoming second nature, causes are combining
People carrying torches, hope burning from their hands
Attaching explosive devices 'cause they keep stealing their lands
In the name of freedom
Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners"

They thought it was cool to tear down the projects and put up million dollar condos, Gentrification.
They think it's cool to stand on the block hiding products in their socks making quick dime bag dollars.

You at war with love, yeah
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid 'cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover strong sends you back into the zone
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
'Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it'll never be over until you tell me it's over
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away

(And just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming ""Medic!""
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much
And I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad

Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...
'Cause you've set me on fire
I've never felt so alive, yeah
Now hope wounds heal but it never does
That's because you at war with love
And I'm at the point of breaking
And it's impossible to shake it
See, you hoped the wound heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
Hope it heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading

There's only two ways out of here
One's through the door

Sometimes living in a world like this
It's pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't comply
Pretty easy if you don't complain
Stand there like you don't feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend to the end that you don't fear change
Don't admit that your faith is weak
Don't say that you feel like dying
Life's hard and it feels like diamonds
Your home's just far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Can't understand what I'm saying?
Can't figure out what I'm implying?

You feel just how I am
I'm on the dark side

All you see is all my rights
All I see is all my wrongs

Gun on the table telling me to ""come on""
Telling me to put him inside my hand
Then put it up right next to my dome
Door keep telling me to find a reason
Anything to keep me from squeezing
Simplest things yeah, you really like summer
You really like music, you really like reading

Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along and this' what she says
""Niggas I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad bitch
Far above average""
And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage
And baby carriage and other things that match it
Couple of things that are happenin' here
First he's relatin' the word ""bitch"" with his mama, comma
And because she's relatin' to herself
His most important source of help and mental health
He may skew respect for dishonor
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Uh, tell 'em
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
On the Internet watchin' videos listenin' to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents.
Now being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're maleable, and probably unmentored.
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
""Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches""
Now let's say that they're less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah, the plot thickens
High heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin'
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Disclaimer: This rhymer, Lupe's not usin' bitch as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection
Cause, while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sure enough, in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He thinks she's bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dress like that, come out the house, hot mess like that
Ass, titties, dress like that
All out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
Bad mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But bad mean bad to him, bitch don't play your part
But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch, what a 
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say

Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood

From the inner-city

Matches on the wall

Suicide watch
I'm just killin' time

Kill Superman
Tied to a log

Like a definition
Like you never listen
Not the issue end it
But the deaf part
Break it in half
Like an intermission
You'll see then
What I mean then
Or what I meant there
Doesn't impair
Now you're learnin' it
Keep rehearsin' it
Till it's permanent
Like pen-pal
Got an empire
I'm the emperor

I'll be faster
Are you tryin' to ask her
Just slow me down

Like a network
That's wolf-man
You got a full house
I got a full moon
Then I pull out
The ace-summer sleeve
Like my hand hurt
Lend me your chips
What they took now
What they put now
Gotta look down
And check your shoulder
'Cause I'll be over

You got boaters
In your loafers
Put your foot down
While I ottoman
Or a Laz-E-Boy
Or a handstand
See I elevate

Takes courage to run on these roadways

All so every soccer Terry Fox moulding, go ahead
Don't stop, go ahead
Sitting in your car, just listening to the bars
And there's traffic all around and you feel like falling down
And the music that I'm spewing out, enough to calm it down
'Fore you know you're out your car with your briefcase walkin' round
And them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production
And Sebastian on the hook, like being dug by Michael Douglas
So don't start that walk through Echo Park
When life's a one-on-one and you caught up in the jam
Just show some love back to your number one fan

Forgive me for my fetishes, my purchases, my clothes
Allow me to catch my rhythm so the nervousness just goes
That's why I sound so certain in my verses and my flows
The verbiage just gets merciless, the wordsmithness just rolls
I've tuned into my pertinence, my purposes, my goals
The feeling when you realize you've been working for your foes
And the curtains have just opened and they worthlessness exposed
You remember where you've came from, where the purses was stole
There was nothing in the oven and just work up on the stove
And you blossomed from the bottom, yeah, you worked with it and rose
From nothing to a dozen and a garden now there grows
Tell 'em!
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart (That's me)
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart
(Yessir) Brave heart
(Yeah I got that) Brave heart
(You know) Brave heart
May the Lord have mercy on my soul
Like shows keep cushion where I land
Keep the devil off my heels
But please keep me on my toes
Like a reposessor checking for everything I drove
Like I owe, but I don't
Paid my dues from the go
Doing donuts in the dome, keep my shoes on the floor
Revered by the rich, plus approved by the poor
I guess it's better when they sniff it
And screwed up where they pour
See I flew so way up high
And I SCUBA'd way down low
Put the top down on my fears
Put the roof up on my woes
I dropped that food and liquor to put you up on my stove
They shoplifted and stole
That just let me know they know
That was Lupe #1, now this version #4
And I still feel like a virgin me versus the globe
From the surface to the cove
I took on the biggest wave
And I surfed it to the shore with no pomade in my fro
Took the wood from the slave ships and furnished my abode
Now that boat is now my bed, desk, dressers and my drawers
Now that's a house of pain!
Plus I use nooses when I hang up all my clothes
Couldn't change up if I chose
That's me
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart
Courage under fire, gave me a brave heart
(Yessir) Brave heart
(Yeah I got that) Brave heart
(You know) Brave heart
Brave heart...

Where we grew up like a green thumb
It's like a criminal is the only thing you can become
Look at what I became
Something like a phenom, nothin' but a g thang
Things I've seen when I'm looking out of these frames
Pictures I painted on the walls where we hang
From the trees we hung
Strange fruit man look at how we swung
How the hell you gonna tell us something
We ain't have a father
How to try to grow up and be one
See umm feel it in my bones
That I'm sittin' on a throne
Like a killer with a chrome
When I spit another poem
Shed a whole lot of light on a little bit of home

Still waitin' on my one phone call from Obama
Tell 'em I need the chopper, they tellin' me I'm a felon
I'm tellin' 'em they got it wrong, I beat the case in '97
And I'm well acquainted with Hell but I'm tryna make it to Heaven
But they don't want me to make it, that's why the niggas be tellin' me
If I don't get the chopper I'mma probably run up inside them
They better gimme a answer, I'm tryna be cool
If I don't get it then everybody gon' fear it
Every week I'm finna make 'em repeat it like they in school
Bed blues, everybody open up somethin'
You can move all you want just not sudden
It ain't no thinkin', I was playin' I am not frontin'
The mentality of a goon, I am not stuntin'

Storm is gone now it's all clear
The road was long but we all here
Now go and tell, I don't care
2014 is our year
Big shout out to the whole streets
This goes out to all that knows me
All y'all pussy niggas, holies
Y'all play tough guys but call the police
Look I don't care, I don't share
I keep me a bad bitch with long hair
I send them choppers around there
When I'm somewhere sittin' in a lounge chair
Overseas, blowin' tree, blowin' green, throwin' B's
Livin' like life is supposed to be
And if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me
To the top, couldn't stop, had a major deal but it wouldn't pop
Niggas hated on me but I wouldn't stop
And now life sweeter than a puddin' pop
Think so slick, come and get me dog
None of y'all niggas fuckin' with me dog
Some of y'all niggas comin' with me dog
None of y'all niggas' boots fit me dog
You think an echo was y'all
You need to think tactical dog
We laughin' at y'all
While you thinking me and Lu radical, naw
Seein' this shit that keep goin' on
Then pick a different zone for your mobile homes
Store fingerprints on your mobile phone
When you sippin' that shit we keep blowin' on
I'm 'bout that, I'm 'bout that
That Bentley out in that driveway
Cost more than my house did
Fuck land, I'm fly today
First class if I fly
Credit card ain't mine
Don't know how I'm gettin' back
But in luxury I arrive, turn up
IPhone in my baby name
Long way from that chirp
Strip pole in my bedroom
But I'mma kill my daughter if she twerk
I'mma kill my daughter if she twerk
Miley Cyrus on that bullshit
But a real nigga can't judge
That for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college
Missed out but no pyrex
My Harley got low milage
This white carpet in my project
30 guns in my section, none of the homies got aim
My side bitch said she pregnant
But I ain't claimin' shit but the game
I ain't claimin' shit but the game
I ain't claimin' shit but the game
And this one is mine, I don't trust his mama
So he don't got my name
Cheap rims on my ride
Mirrors loose as my beat pound
I ain't addicted to shit
My weed man on my speed dial

Got the same setup as the SWATs, nigga
Shouldn't find that surprising
'Cause I bought the muthafucka from a cop
Ay, seen a lot of brown money as a shorty
Welfare baby can't afford me
Healthcare there, I ain't worried
Healthcare there, I ain't worried
Excuse me, as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete myself
My opposition is not pretending
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself
Fuck being a hip hop purist
When I'm spendin' 50 thousand on Securus
Embrace the contradiction, you'll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It's why I look at God kinda odd
'Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen can't fill us, Medicare can't heal us
And the mamas can't stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video, it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride
With an L up sayin', ""Free da guys"" like I'm Durk
With a clean record but I'm cursed
To make a half a million off a verse

19,Cold War,2012,Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1 (2012),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"At my brother's Janazah
Tears stained sunglassses
A Salat with no bows
Pallbearer carry you to the car now
Chilly day, Mosque on 96 and 3rd
New York City way, me and Jay never left my side
Rest like that picture with your pride
Who look just like...
Now the city looks less bright
Brooklyn looking less special
Don't carry the same weight
As when you were on this level
You: work in progress from 40 projects, God bless
An inspiration and a king
They won't know what I mean but this one 'bout to spring
Protect it with every feather on the wings
So even when it hurts, you'll never feel a thing
Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold...
Let me clarify the chorus
And what my cold war is
Cause the complexity is enormous
Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets
To reinforce every single word that I talk with
Something about losing things, human beings
That reduces things to their most elementary
Find yourself where you never meant to be
With the energy of memories
That's the soul force of what's behind killing me
Finding pleasure in the pains
Like finding desert in the rain
Twisted: how this world can drive you masochistic
Question if I'm over it
Or if I'm numb because I'm closureless
Or my closure's that we all gotta go and shit
Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it
Still happy that I opened it
Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold...
In the studio writing these words, one after another
In memorial of my brother
As you listen to the album with
Nothing on the cover
I imagine that he hovers
In the back of his chair
Floating right there in the air
Nodding his head to the music, I slightly lose it
Ask why do I put myself through this
Crack a smile, look up at the file
The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean
But I feel that it's all lost, or maybe that it's all gotta cross
Happy with his dedicated song
But now he's all gone
But he was never there, cause
He was everywhere, nowhere and down here
Maybe on that judgement day, rise up
We'll both open our eyes up, climb up
Hoping God forgives us for our tendencies
Wipes away our cool young histories
Said it's a cold cold war
Ain't nobody wins like the government
In the U.S.S.R
Cause this is all for shares
Nobody cares
Who you think you are
And you can fight it, but there's no defense
For what things are
Baby grab a jacket
It's a cold, cold...
Ride around, you know what I'm saying
All over the world right? I mean, everywhere
I mean we just disappear and just come back
I feel like we can just put him anywhere
He'd find his way back home, y'know'm saying
Another random thing's that consequence to me
But maybe to you, not much
But with that said, the reason behind me
Why I do what I does, love
Just riding around bumping that, uh
Either Jay or Nas, or me
I used to tell him like ""yeah you all right""
But you ain't fucking with my man
It was always like that, so
Drop a little for you, let it bump
This that Esco music, it's that Esco music
Bumping with my Esco music, that raw
See you on the other side, As-Salamu Alaykum"

Claudia, all right, gonna do this
This one goes out to the baby girls
In a rush growing up in this crazy world
Yeah your brother on the row, he ain't ever home
I know you're feeling kinda sad now that daddy gone
You can't let it get you down, gotta carry on
We only lose things because it make us strong
You always have my love, and now you got a song
From the biggest biggest fan that you've ever known
I know you want me little girls, not for very long
And you ain't gotta have a man if you ain't ever want
'Cause I'mma make sure you got two of everything
That you ever want, every tone make your very own
Not to make you hard to respect
Just really, really, really, really hard to impress
There's a whole wide world for you to get your hands on
Until then, just come and get your dance on now
I see you coming up
I'mma give you the low down, down, down
You ain't never gotta worry about nothing
Just as long as I'm around, round, round, round
This for everybody feeling good
You know who you are, or you misunderstood
Never had money, or you living good
If you from the burbs, if you in the hood
Recognise where we come from
In my day man I did a little something something
They like ""how come you don't rap that?""
'Cause that's a back track and I ain't trying to back back
I'm only moving forward, homie, that's that
Direction, a lot of shoulders lack that
I'm just trying to give it to 'em like sat nav
Now I know a money maker like a fat rat
That's cool, as long as he don't trap crack
Graduate from school and still let his pants sag
Never catch a case, know how to let his cash stack
Welcome to the map of dough, any way trap that now
I see you coming up
I'mma give you the low down, down, down
You ain't never gotta worry about nothing
Just as long as I'm around, round, round, round
Pooh Bear!
And if the roof falls down, I'mma be there to carry you
And if you want that star, I'll go get it out the sky for you
If you gotta shed a tear, I'mma dry your eyes
Just to let you know it'll be all right
I know there's like a whole lot going on
Things going right, things going wrong
Maybe baby on the way, in you for so long
Know that in this world you're never really on your own
God got a number, get Him on the phone
He'll never put you in places where you don't belong
Put you through the pain to put you on the throne
And I know that from the bottom of my corazon
And if they looking at you sideways
You just wave right back and tell them ""Hi"", ""hey""
Man you ain't hanging with 'em in the driveway
Naw, we gonna keep 'em moving to the highway
Strong as puttin' on
Wicked all over like Friday Chilli
Shout to King David for bringing them to Philly
And I'mma put an independent rhythm in the building, let's go
I see you coming up
I'mma give you the low down, down, down (all the way down)
You ain't never gotta worry about nothing
Just as long as I'm around, round, round, round
I see you coming up
I'mma give you the low down, down, down (all the way down)

Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sittin' on the shoulders, but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news camera's filmin' this walkin', project buildin'
Now there's hoes selling hoes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest

We need a few more half-naked women up in the pool
And hold this MAC-10 that's all covered in jewels
And can you please put your titties closer to the 22's
And where's the champagne, we need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And know hold up your chains, slow motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the baby's sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tip-toe round, creeping
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see half the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me
I was

All in the ears of the ghetto young
Some ghetto girls, some ghetto sons
Throwing rocks at the bus and other ghetto fun
I always wondered where the ghetto from
'Cause I'm from the ghetto, the never ghetto come
Buzz you in if the bell of my ghetto rung
And if the ghetto lose, that mean a ghetto won
That's how they do the ghetto, that's how the ghetto done
They keep it, they never bring the ghetto none
What make the ghetto tick, make the ghetto run
What make the ghetto sick, make the ghetto dumb
These niggas off that ghetto beer and that ghetto rum
And that ghetto bass with my ghetto drums
And my ghetto words and these ghetto problems get ghetto sums

'Cause a prostitute sucking dick in the hallway

Of hate in a place where ethnicity determines your placement
A place that defines your station

White folks act like they ain't show us how to traffic

Or maybe just imagine that I'm living in a mansion
Or a palace and my pizza gets delivered in a Benz
Make a savior out of savage like they made it out of magic
So it take a nigga havoc and it make it into friends
You don't even need a salad, it don't make a nigga fatter
Actually take a nigga backwards and make a nigga thin
That's a deep dish, Chicago style get the peace stick

(Pimp see/Pimp C) the wings on the Underground King
Who's also (Klingon/cling on) to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks but I sphinx like Leon
Or lion in the desert
I'm flying on Pegasus, you flying on a pheasant
Writer of the white powder, picker of the fire flower
Spit hot fire like Dion on Chappelle skit
Yeah, smell it on my unicorn
We snort the white horse and toot my own horns (sleep)
(Chorus 2-white man)
You been getting too much light, Lu (dumb it down)
You make 'em wanna do right, Lu (dumb it down)
They're getting self-esteem, Lu (dumb it down)
These girls is tryna be queens, Lu (dumb it down)
They're tryna graduate from school, Lu (dumb it down)
They're starting to think that smart is cool, Lu (dumb it down)
They're tryna get up out the hood, Lu (dumb it down)
I'll tell you what you should do (dumb it down)
(Verse 3-Lupe Fiasco)
And I'm brainless which means I'm headless like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplay-less sex is which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang a chain with
Which makes me necklace-less like a necklace theft
And I ain't used my headrest yet
They said they need Proof like a vestless chest
About to best fair FF jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even Scuba Steve will find it hard to breathe around these leagues
My snorkle is a tuba, Lu the ruler around these seas
Westside Poseido, Westside beside him
Chest high and rising, almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot lucky they make ya fly with
Personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves
David Blaine, make it rain, make a boat, I make a plane
Then I pull the plug and I make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again
(Westside)
(Chorus 3-Gemini)
You be putting me to sleep, nigga (dumb it down)
That's why you ain't poppin' in the streets, nigga (dumb it down)
You ain't winning no awards, nigga (dumb it down)
Robots and skate boards, nigga? (dumb it down)
GQ man of the year, G (dumb it down)
Shit ain't rocking over here, B (dumb it down)
Why don't you talk about your cars, nigga (dumb it down)
And what the fuck is Goyard, nigga? (dumb it down)
Make it rain for the chicks (dumb it down)
Pour champagne on a bitch (dumb it down)
What the fuck is wrong with you? (dumb it down)
How can I get on a song with you? (dumb it down)
(Gemini speaking
Look B, here's my math. My 2-way, uh, this right here. Take this. That right there. Fuck with my boy. Faradon nigga, nigga you hot to me. I like you.

When the fighters are all around
All the lovers are underground
No one will save you anymore
So what's happening, what you rapping about?
It's a boy, is it cars? Is it girls? Is it my lie? The world?
(Lupe Fiasco)
Or is it something they can never believe?
Or is it something you could never achieve?
Is it beyond your means?
Is it inside your dreams?
Can it never come out 'cause it's scared to, unprepared to
Too worried 'bout the words of the people it's weird to
You don't want them to hear 
You just wish there was a door that would appear
That you could disappear through
Well I'm feelin' your pain
I was feelin' the same
But I said I'd never feel that again

Hope that god watches over him and that he's on top
That there is no more disease and that he's alright
That he's one of the generals inside the army of the light
And grandma you know I had to bite somethin' from ya
So after every show it's ""peace and much love to ya""

27,Form Follows Function,2012,Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1 (2012),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"I'ma just go... and then we'll figure it out from there
They say form follows function
And if you just function properly then things will form themselves
Yeah, that's kind of what it is
So on that note... America's most
First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin' around my temple
Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
And they sink in the same sea that we walk
Not that we Jesus, we just don't wait until it thaws
But you can hold my hand like applause, pause/paws
With no homophobia involved
Now if I would've said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls
That would've been the call, but naw
You can't see in ours, but we can see in yours
You can't see in ours cause ours is Kingdom Hall
Yeah, just like that, we just let it roll, you know?
Yeah, and check it, check it
So when that pond thaws and it's no longer Gretzky
That's when we jetski
I gotta catch up to myself, I kind of left me
Are the windows still blocked up? Let's see
Maybe see something we couldn't view before
Been in the stu all day cooking food for thought
Now out the soup du jour for you and yours
Might find sushi for your soul, we call that moving raw
Lions won't cross the line
Cougars won't move a paw
Chickens won't cross the road
Dogs won't roof at all
Always had flow, just added a front door, roof, and walls
Hotter than the fire that into which Koopa falls
But that's only if you super dawg
Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
You can never really tell just who's the fraud
Truth might still be alive like true and false
That's why I never really trust unless it's Lu endorsed
Sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced
Now that's three me's, like you warming up your vocal chords
Add a fourth if your vocals hoarse
Like Mister Ed
Get out of pocket have a horse's head in your bed
Now that's what I call a good night's rest
You know? You know, just plays like that
When you just let it flow
When you sit back and just let it go, you know?
And now my vocals warm
Add a fifth and a sixth now I'm ready to perform
The Buddhist said that I am not reformed
If I ever be reborn I keep coming back as me
We don't forget the other five as we
Weave the most wanted Angelina Jolies
And Morgan Frees
Send it around the room like we smoking trees
But it's no purple in the circle then there ain't no rolling
Bees just spoken words, thought provoking reeds
Hydro, I'm still strolling on the seas
Aloe, like the lotion from the leaves
And to achieve it took a lot of token like Chuck E. Cheese
All without touching weed
But I'm still hungry and I'm having lunch for three
This is my form, now what the function be
And aww at what I draw
And ooh at what I say like Imogen Heap
Good night niggas, go to sleep
You know? It's like form follows function
And if you function properly then
The form will come out of it
And whatever it is, it
It just be what it is, you know?"
28,Free Chilly (Interlude),2007,The Cool (2007),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"First off,
I'd like to take a moment before I get in your head.
And apologize to every fan I've ever mislead.
There's a lot of things I rapped about you shouldn't have been fed.
I've led people to destruction from the things that I have said.
I've glorified, busting women down, selling drugs, making rounds.
Anything negative you can think of to keep us down.
Because when it's positive people don't want to hear it.
Wanted to speak the truth but I was afraid that you wouldn't feel it.
I've overcame and I'm not ashamed of it.
Untamed beast was cool but I wasn't talking about nothing.
Lying in my lyrics to be accepted by the critics.
Or the high punch lines about crack that I didn't distribute.
God bless me with a talent to paint a picture so vivid.
Now turned around a broke us down.
Ignorance is bliss.
How could I be so oblivious?
But they say a first step to recover is to admit.
They gave my homie 44 years, chilled you truly missed.
Trapped your body not your mind.
Your dreams will take you where you wish.
Homies in your head.
Your sanities who you should moving with.
When you locked behind them bars and your physical don't exist.
Even though you locked down.
It's still FNF up!
Troubles of the world is finished can't wait till it's pressed up.
I can't explain the feeling standing on stages in each city.
And the curtains roll back and they screaming out free chilly.
If we could break down those walls to set you free,
We would, 'cause we out here, and we miss you.
If we could build a ladder that tall, to come up and see you, we would,
'Cause we down there, and we miss you.
If we could break down those walls to set you free,
We would, 'cause we out here, and we miss you."

Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at
And for you baby I'll be your maniac

And you don't have to worry 'bout nothing

Oh I'll be on the sidelines rooting for my dime
Holding up my sign and it say

That's my honey if I give her money she ain't gotta pay me back
No you ain't gotta pay me back

And I'll forever give you my love 'cause
When I'm down you always put a smile on me
And when all of my strength's up, and I'm 'bout to give up
And I need a lift up, I hear her say
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) (x16)
She loves me, she loves me more
Amour me, she assures
She adores me
Even when it's up and down like see-saw
Surely, we can start from scratch like default
When they say you're not my baby like Maury
You can tell 'em that they're telling a story
Testify like you're telling a jury
And I'll repeat like you said it before me
We undefeated like a veteran army
And we as heavy as an elephant, aren't we?
Let's take 'em to the zoo, or better yet a safari
They want me to leave my Dame like the fella from Marcy (No!)
But we go way back like a set of Atari's
From baby fat till we skeletons darling
""Me"" starring ""You"" is what it says on the marquee
So let's go give them a show, on my heart, get set, go!
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) (x16)
And you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker
Extravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese
You best believe
That you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker
Extravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese
Yes indeed!
Where my ladies at?

Feels good wakin' up,
Get back... on my J.O.
Ooh,
And you will be going, 'cause I gotta go to work
It's coo...
I wipe the cool from my eye
Stationed in Antarctica, coldest nigga alive
Flow is Armageddon might smite crows/Cruise from the Sky
Before you drive you have to wipe locusts off your rides
But I'm warming up, oceans is on the rise
I be Ocean with 11 associates on my side
Colder than Chris Martin guitarin' - would you look at all these Spies?
But they can't see me, I took out their eyes
Replaced them with some me's, so all they see is he's
But I will never run, not even if they cry
See I can never fall, not even down their cheek
But I will always ball/bawl, let's see who the first to blink
And I don't need no passwords 'cause I don't need to cheat
But you can say your last words then you can rest in peace
I'm the hook after your last verse, I'm also like the beat
But I will turn it down so you can go to sleep
You can go to sleep
Yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep (x2)

Real niggas poppin' off, phony niggas not at all
Insomniac since way back, see that's what I been like
Bacon, eggs and pancakes, eating that at midnight
Getting up and going hard, I don't need no Enzyte
Come across as very calm, mental state is Zen like
Always had a lot of heart, never been the tin type
Never will I drop a dime, never been the ten type
My girlfriend is very fine, yeah she is a ten, right?
Niggas draggin'/dragon on the flow/floor, fire in my windpipe
You should come and clean up after riots that I incite
Things got off the handle, left behind a landfill
Traffic at a standstill, stadium is fan-filled
Fill this bitch up with fans, you still won't blow my candle - out
My can do spirit's in the house, and it's possessing your possessions,
Did you hear it by the couch?
Boogeyman under here but not in your closet, 'cause I'm not a homo
Bonjour no dojo, I won't make a peep so...

Yes you can go to sleep
Now you can go to sleep

Real niggas poppin' off, phony niggas not at all
I wipe the cold from my eye, then put it in my stove and hope that my dough rise
And that my clothes dry, but I am so high, I'm sitting on the storm that I got soaked by
Now you can come close so, you can get warm
But you get no pie, but you can sell 'em for him so, here's your bow tie
Now get ready to fall, 'cause humans don't fly, the boy in the balloon
See I didn't go high/hide, and I'm coming back to float/flow again
Flow sound hard like opium, but I had to ??
They said they need a hero in it, so I'm back to dope again
Pull up in that old school Flintstone drop on rolling pins
Time is all behind me, this make me feel old again
Grandma's all around me, I can feel her soul within'
Hold my daddy over him
I woke the rooster's, woke the hen's
Everything's cashmere, count the sheep so...
You can go to sleep

Do the knowledge, man you can't be punk from projects
Firm disbeliever in your punch clock promise
Was trading off my comics, I was taking them to school
One of Jay-Z boys now I'm skating in your pools
Not to be rude I'm just hating on your rules

Hey he had a whole lotta cheese
Plus he was a mack had a whole lotta seeds
Made a lot of niggas fat, gave a whole lotta G's
Grams man he had a whole lotta these
And he would let you hold like a whole lotta ki's
Even if you lose some he would give you new ones
Twice the bread it's like he had two buns
And he had a whole lotta seeds
Even his kids had meals for reals
Some rich small fries wrapped in paper since they was lil
Ketchup nigga

(Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco)
He was a heart breaker and a large shaker
If it was bout cakin' he was a part taker
International he would take trips bon voyage
That's so hard he was fishin' for the chips
So greedy he never gave to the needy
That's what some say
The way he shunned all the bums hangin' in the subways
He called them fruits then laughed at 'em
Delivery man on the pick-up drive through
And throw a bag at 'em
And it was hard to understand him sometimes
Makin' a killin' the way he had 'em standin in line

(Verse Three - Lupe Fiasco)
Lovers call him king, haters call him clown
He would say bite me that's the way it's going down
He was havin' thoughts that maybe he should retire
Went to church on a Sunday and saw a deep frier
Said he had beef and people want him dead
He loved the hungry ones was only scared of the feds
He lived the fast life couldn't get his path right
Frier just told him 'bout the hooters that he had last night
Turned himself in to the paddywagon, said no
Bacon wouldn't take him half the pigs on the payroll

Will he give up his life of crime or will he stay?

Like ""brother"" without the R
And he's starting to harbor
Cool and food for thought
But for you he's a starver
Starting to use red markers on his work
His teacher say they know he's much smarter
But he's hurt
Used to hand his homework in first
Like he was the classroom starter
Burst to tears
Let them know she see us
Now he's fighting in class
Got a note last week that say he might not pass
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us
Cause you ain't never pick him up
You see what his problem is?
He don't know where his poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's making a hole you've been digging it
Cause you ain't been kicking it
Since he was old enough to hold bottles
Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that
He don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart
When I try to provide and he say 'Mommy that ain't your job'
To be a man, I try to make him understand
That I'm his number one fan
But it's like he born from the stands
You know the world is out to get him, so why don't you give him a chance?""
So he said to him
""I want you to be a father
I'm your little boy and you don't even bother
Like ""brother"" without the R
And I'm starting to harbor

Everything I got, I give it all to you
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you
'Cause I'm a heart donor
I'm just a conduit
To keep you calm through it
So you respond lucid
That mean you're not foolish
When it's gone, stupid
You think you gonna lose it
But you don't bounce, you just bond to it
Like you Sean Con or Gorilla Glue-ish
With a blonde in your palm, King Kong in your coolness
But they still tryna knock you off the roof kid
Singing you the blues, you crayon up the music
Change it in the rainbows and rubics
Keep telling yourself you the wave of the future Howard Hughes is
It's huge if you refuse to blow your fuses
You blow up, exactly how Lu did
(Hook: Pooh Bear)
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor
Everything I got, I give it all to you
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you
'Cause I'm a heart donor
'Cause I'm a heart donor
I hope my stories can keep you off Maury
Away from a lawyer, far from a mandatory
Which means, through the mail the only way you see yo shorties
Keep your sons out the slums and your daughters out of orgies
Look in the mirror, see yourself and adore thee
Whisper in your ear, I fear nothing that's before me
And always remember that you're royalty
From the line drawn to this Porky
And everything that's in between
Make sure you cherish every scene
And put on the biggest show your adversaries ever seen
Now even if you've never limousined
Important, yeah you're very there
There's red carpet everywhere
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor
Cause everything I got, I give it all to you
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you
'Cause I'm a heart donor
'Cause I'm a heart donor
Just know I got your back, yeah I got it, and I'ma go to bat
Like Gotham's under attack I will spot em,
Keep you from ever touching the mat
Be your Robin, bring that onomatopoeia
Down upon all your problems like ""zap! boom! bang!""
Cause all y'all my pals
I tribune on your tribulations, channel through your trials
Please God, help keep the value in my vows
A man of my words that Vanna turns around
And if your fortune turns, I never turn you down
No matter who your healthcare provider, I'm a rider
Even if I gotta bring the fibulators out
A John Q on cue just for you
I'm a heart donor, I'm a heart donor
Cause everything I got, I give it all to you
My heart and my soul, I give it all to you
'Cause I'm a heart donor
'Cause I'm a heart donor"

Hello nowhere, hello oblivion, hello goodbye
Hello darkness, hello sunshine, hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion, hello goodbye
Hello Darkness
[X6] You
All in together the weather is better than ever
I hope it never ends I hope it lasts forever
But when it does, we can all pretend that it's better than it's ever been
Lie to ourselves like the sky to rebel
And its well and its fine and its fine if it fell
And you couldn't find the story line if you survive to retell
We are targets, Hello darkness
Hello sunshine, hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion, hello goodbye
Said everything is going to be fine
Said everything is gonna be ok
Said just don't breathe the air
He just sits and waits for them to kick in the door
He once was a hero they don't love him no more
There's a blast, every time a foot hits the floor
His gift for not fighting another man's war
And if they can get their hands on the mask that he wore
On his face, they can put somebody else in his place and restore
The state, the illusion that its safe
The fate, that being a slave is so great
As gas fills the room and rockets destroy everything around him
He stands to find himself surrounded
By thousands of soldiers that he once trained to never miss their targets
Heartless, hello darkness
Hello sunshine, hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion, hello goodbye
Hello Darkness
Pleased to make your acquaintance
Salutations, Konnichiwa
Hello end of the world, how are you, I do fine
Hello darkness, hello sunshine, hello not at all, hello all the time

My other hand throwin' we without the E up
I got like five more, man I'm somethin' like Sheeva

The folks on loans and the stones are beat up
Police tap my phones, got my songs on speaker
Said he's spat the poems got they domes all geeked up
To get up on they domes and become young leaders
Oprah put it on my culture now that ain't wrong
Imus got it from the rhymers now that ain't blown

To my homie with the dream
Nah what I mean

Write to make it right, don't like where I be
I'd like to make it like the sights on TV
Quite the great life, so nice and easy""
See, now you can still die from that
But it's better than not being alive from straps
Agreed, a Mead notebook and a Bic that click
When it's pushed and a wack ass beat
That's a track that's weak that he got last week
Cause everybody in the stu' was like, ""That's that heat""
A bass heavy medley with a sample from the 70s
With a screwed up hook that went (stack that cheese)
Something, something, something (stack that cheese)
Mother, sister, cousin (stack that cheese)
He couldn't think of nothing, (stack that cheese)
He turns down the beat, writer's block impedes
Crying from the next room a baby in need
Of some Pampers and some food and place to sleep
That plus a black Cadillac on Ds
Is what keep him on track to be a great MC

Eleven hundred friends on his Myspace page
""Stack That Cheese"" got seven hundred plays
Producer made him take it down, said he had to pay
Open mic champ two weeks in a row
Ex-D-Boy with a b-boy flow
Glow like Leroy, you should see Boy go
Got a daddy serving life and a brother on the row
Best homie in the grave, tatted up while in the cage
Minute Maid got his momma working like a slave
Down baby momma who he really had to honor
'Cause she was his biggest fan, even let him use her Honda to
Drive up to Dallas, went to open up for amateurs
Let him keep a debit card so he could put gas in it
Told her when he get on, he gon take her to the Galleria
Buy her everything but the mannequins, ya dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

His man called, said, ""Your time might be now
They played your freestyle over 'Wipe Me Down'
They played it two times, said it might be crowned
As the best thing out the H-town in a while""
He picked up his son with a great big smile
Rapped every single word to the newborn child
Then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
And put on another beat and got back to the mission of
Get his momma out the hood, put her somewhere in the woods
Keep his lady looking good, have her rolling like she should
Show his homies there's a way other than that flippin' yay
Bail his homie outta jail, put a lawyer on his case
Throw a concert for the school, show the shorties that it's cool
Throw some candy on the Caddy, chuck the deuce and act a fool
Man, it feels good when it happens like that
Two days from going back to selling crack, yessir, sir, sir, sir, sir. sir

You feel radiant and outrageous
Your confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that
I got my eyes on like the fire zone
Let's be bygones
Won't you come and be a line in one of my songs?
Maybe a whole verse, baby the whole Earth my home
So let me show you around the crib
Tell you what I do, I show you what I did
Flow is on the stove, I'm cooking for the kids
Wrist is in the freezer, heart is in the fridge
But we can warm it up, plug the Foreman up
Open the oven door, turn the saunas up
Stretch the Benz out, if it ain't long enough
Get lost in the feeling, they're no longer us
Hop up out the coupe, hop up on the bus
Give you 'get to the backs', code name for Rosa's sons
We're in a better place, give us condolences
It's like a player's wake, and like a coma love
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel, you feel radiant and outrageous
Your confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that
And I hope it's all up to your standards
Cause babies really need to be pampered
I'm behind these tents like a camper
'Cause you're out there shining like chandler
Like a chandelier standing there in your radiance
I think we all need some shadiness
Or some vision care, oh no, you didn't dare
While I was sitting here like Huey in his wicker chair
You know that isn't fair, how you just entered here
Getting their hopes up, that they can interfere
You're so insincere, you know I got you
Have you looked in the mirror? You know that's not cool
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel, you feel radiant and outrageous
Your confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that
Let's have a cease fire, be some peace triers
Let's negotiate, because my cheeks tired
From smiling all day
Emotions need a Motrin, a Tylenol break
I know you see my strategy, if flattery's a battery
Then I'm a rabbit with a pack of 'D's in the back of me
Pause/paws on all levels, everybody settle
I know it sounded weird, I'm just trying to impress you
I step forward with my best two
If all that fails, open swag to the rescue
I said swag, and I'm sorry
Don't mean to offend your sensibilities I meant dress smartly
Just trying to get you out this party
Can you dig that? Ologist-Archae
Please be the Ferrari to my car key
And I'ma hold my baby down like a car seat
You know what you're doing to me
You got that fire fire, baby
I just can't get enough
No, I can't get enough
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel radiant and outrageous
Your confidence and appeal, you're so sexual

Yeah
This one right here, huh
I dedicate this one right here
To everybody out there
Ya dig, uh-huh
Check it out
Now I ain't trying to be the greatest
I used to hate hip-hop, yup, because the women degraded
But Too Short made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite, I stated, though I only recited half
Omitting the word bitch, cursing I wouldn't say it
Me and Dog couldn't relate, till a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learnt it from a song I heard and sorta liked
Yeah, for the ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rap based filmings became the building blocks for children
With leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac, Nas's ""It Was Written""
In the mix with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world and listen, it drop
My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
And I got no place to go
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it hurts me soul
I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
'Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinking godly, God guard me from the ungodly
But by my 30th watching of ""Streets Is Watching""
I was back to giving props again and that was bothering
'Bout as uncomfortable as a untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustle to
Seem wrong, but these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into and thought
What constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit, then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said don't knock it, mind ya business
His business isn't mine, then that nigga pimping got it
Woo, uhn
They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, they cross on fire

Shining all in your eyes, all out of yours and all into mines
Lights and stars is all intertwined
And I'm feeling like Malcolm looking all out the blinds
Any means any means, and you can do anything anything
And the flow tight, skinny jeans, skinny jeans
Hit you like Pacquiao, Philippines Philippines

But they can't, they accented like the UK
Turn that ""Eau de Lupe"" to Pepe Le Peu spray
Flagrantly fragrant and they can't escape it
My perfume pursued them everywhere that they went
You don't want a loan leave my cologne alone
It's a little to strong for you to be putting on
Trust me I say this justly
I went from musty to musky and y'all can't mush me
I warn y'all cornballs I Hush Puppies
The swans in the pond call my duck ugly
But now they hug me, because it's lovely
They love the aroma of a roamer of the world
Got the shakers and the skaters and the players and the girls
Keep the fakers and the flakers and the haters in a twirl
You want the flaver-ma, hey I gotcha
You want the realness, well I gotcha

You know we do it
And I'm from Chi-Town town, that's where I flies round round
Keep some Cartier frames over my eyes now
We used to gangbang a lot of that done died down
Children of the hat tiltin' keepin' hope alive now
All with no high, I do it so fly
Banksy's attack helicopter with the bow tie
I love my city really hope that God bless it
Have my mind moving faster than that hog in the hedges
Welcome all of y'all to my dark recesses
This is where I keep the bars like bathtub edges
My Ivories and my Doves my Levers and my Zests
It takes half of your bubble bath to match the freshness
The belly of the beast you know I'm from it
I wrap it in a towel here go my pal in the stomach
And I be on my green like Irish Spring and I coast
Fudge wit it and get a mouth full of soap
You want the flaver-ma, hey I gotcha

You want the real shit, well I gotcha
You see my peoples here, you know we proper
You know we do it right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
You know we do it
And so to sign off off, this beat I rhyme off off
Is from Thelonious P and Hugo Mind Boss boss
You feel it in the air air, it's such a fine force force
But you don't hear me though though, just like a mimes talk talk
That's 'cause I'm in Europe, me and my friends tour a
I'm on my pimp, my temperature is tempura
I take it easy on my watch I'm watchin' TV
Am I clean as Maharshi, see the hare is trying to beat me
I continue to do Lu's pace
They say him got two heads and four eyes just like twoface
But see my secret's safe it's in my secret safe
That's in my secret room on my secret base
So from the runner of the FNF crew
Come in hip hop we've come to resurrect you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You want the flaver-ma, hey I gotcha

Now those the type of eyes, I not cry from
You see the tears of fire run out my cryin' songs
Now the world's shoulders is what we cryin' on
The world's fast lane is what I'm drivin' on
What am I driving at? I'm tryna drive it home
I'm in the driver's seat, but you can ride along
'Cause never cyclops, it's never I alone
I'm tellin' your story wherever I perform

From the cocaine and the kilos
Aiight nigga, we know
Aiight nigga, we know
Can we get a break from the strippers on the pill
Aiight nigga, we know
Okay nigga, we know
Hey shawty, ain't no future in no gang-bang
And ain't no manhood in no bang-bang
Ain't no honor cleanin interstates inside a chain-gang
Know some rap niggas put that shit inside your mainframe
Pills make you stupid and liquor do the same thing
'Raris too expensive and they way too hard to maintain
Get yourself a Camry, ""nigga said a Camry?""
Watch that ho depreciate and then you'll understand me
It's called being fiscally responsible
Don't let these lying images up in hip-hop here conquer you
The TV's not your father fool, that video's not your momma
Try your best to be a man and your worst to be a monster
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here's some kisses for the babies
Some peacenality for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the down and pressed
Treat no liar ITAL, AY-YAH!
I know you're sayin', ""Lupe rappin' 'bout the same shit""
Well, that's 'cause ain't shit changed, bitch
And please don't excuse my language
'Cause I would hate for you to misrepresent
The true expression of my anguish
And by this far I ain't shocked, upset, or appalled
I'm ashamed, bitch
I can't listen if you ain't sayin' shit
And recognize all this emptiness is dangerous
Ain't buildin up they confidence, we teachin 'em that they ain't shit
If they ain't got the latest that they saw on someone famous
Mercy of the Lord on this double-edged sword
Instead of askin where the hoes is
Maybe maybe we could ask for roses
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here's some kisses for the babies
Some peacenality for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the down and pressed
Treat no liar ITAL, AY-YAH!

And here's some kisses for the babies
Some peacenality for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for the down and pressed
Treat no liar ITAL, AY-YAH!
Called the President a terrorist
Corporate sponsors like, how the fuck you gon' embarrass us?
Ain't my fault, I was just repeatin this
Professor emeritus from America
But my tone was like an Afghani kid without a home
Blew that bitch up with a drone
An Iraqi with no daddy, Palestinian throwing stones
The fuck you think they call him, I'mma leave that all alone
Cause this, the focus on this new shit is that hopeless
Place that I was born into systematic brokeness
Took that downpression and developed it to dopeness
It's that great American rap-rap ferocious
May we have some roses for the ladies
A little appreciation for the gentlemen
And here's some kisses for the babies
Some peacenality for the whole wide-wide-wide world
More patience to the youth, sympathy for the poor

Every level of hell he's been to and the one that he's stuck in.

Well the cops didn't fine 'em for grindin', no
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
Plus he had to be at home a long time ago
And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
It read, ""A little hungry and need a little money
It's for my little sister and her little tummy""
Wasn't lyin' though, he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
'Cause he knew they wasn't cooking where he lived
The kunk-kakunk-kakunks now took him to the crib
A little hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right past the pushers who couldn't underdig
""What's the use of pushin'? You ain't pushin' none of this""
If I kick it with y'all, I'm just pushin' for a bid
But what was on his mind had pushed him to the lid
Their best customer wasn't cookin' for her kids, yes sir
Gets up to pump so he kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, and so he kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah
You see his mom was a crackhead
And his father couldn't be contacted
He lived with being different, was combated
Amongst the other things on his young black head
And see his girl was a white girl
But, just 'cause she was white, see her life wasn't light-world
She too had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a mama but her daddy used to mama hit
Daddy caught something, chasing fatties made her mama sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped it to the pharmacist
As suicidal feelings would rise, switch over to transitions helped her conquer it
Pays for her mama's pills with a sponsorship
A cell phone bill and a Honda kit, uh-huh
And that's why she skates with he
Someone to feel her pain and her place to be
That's why, that's why, that's why she kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, that's why she kick, push
Over his shoulders she swore she'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah
A traveling band of misfits and outcasts
Knock their heads from Misfits to Outkast
A lot of scars, they did this without pads
A lot of hearts who did this without dads
One's father was filthy rich
Two was middle class and one was homeless
Add in a paralyzed girl in a wheelchair
Who just liked to watch it, that was the whole clique
I think about it every time I see this old flick
That was taken in the park in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, ""You thank for push, kick
Hope you make a video, the beat is so sick""
Well, I did, I hope you seen it
It's on MTV, Soundtrakk's a genius
Love from Tony Hawk, beef from the Ice Creamaz
Before we out it, had to pay the Filipinas
Just to show 'em how you kick, push
Over your shoulders you swore you'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, that's why you kick, push
Over your shoulders you swore you'd never look
'Cause wasn't nothin' back there but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive, yeah"

The world's gone stark, raving mad
Everyone in the world is mad

Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
Listen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause
A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
Shun him while in public disallow him from your stores
Have no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours
Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
But we must still pray that his colour will be cured

Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
With her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
He looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains
How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
From the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims
To do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane
You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
You torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame
Blank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name
Perfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints
May God bless the scientific cure for the insane
Knew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change
I see diamond-flooded demons

Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
With his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
Put his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
Told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
Now the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time
With no life inside his body now he finally think he's safe
But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
Doesn't mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
He forgives them in advance says that he will do again
My fellow Americans...

Feels like I'm running out of soul
You're getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
My self-portrait,
Shows a man that the wealth tortured,
Self absorbed with his own self,
Forfeit a shelf full of awards,
Worshiping the war ships that set sail on my sea of life,
Way I see my own self and wonder if we still see alike,
We was tight, seeing lights,
Speaking right and breathing life,
Now I see my demons and barely even sleep at night,
I don't get high, life keep me at a decent height,
As the old me, I predicted all my recent plights,
Exhausted, trying to fall asleep
Lost inside my recent fights,
Burdens on my shoulders, now,
Burning all my motors down,
Inspiration drying up,
Motivation slowing down.
Things are getting out of control
Feels I'm running out of soul
You're getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
I'm begging you don't let me go,
We vowed like the letter O
To never go our separate ways,
To spin off into separate shows,
Tired of all the wardrobe changing,
Playing all these extra roles,
Filled with all these different spirits,
Living off these separate souls,
Point of life is getting hollow,
Can't wait for the exit hole,
Give me room to entry wound,
Let me in or let me go
So I can roam around this wilderness,
See it for what it really is, unprepared and filter-less,
Magnify the euphony,
Alibi the shooting spree,
Amplify the revolution,
Sanitize the lunacy,
Strip away the justice,
Justify the scrutiny,
I can see the lasers shooting out of you and me 
Things are getting out of control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
You're getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go
Sometimes I feel like the world
Sometimes I feel lonely, and the world is against me
And everything that I've done before, I swear we used to be so pure
But we can't be in love no more 'cause I don't want to fight this War
But when I put down my gun, I turn around and pick up one
It's an Uzi waste of time, but I think I'm done
Things are getting out of control
Feels like I'm running out of soul
You're getting heavy to hold
Think I'll be letting you go"
57,Little Death,2015,Tetsuo & Youth (2015),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"Now bring it out like a finger in the back of your mouth
Cherubs and cerebellum, Tara at Sarah's wedding
Sam marrying Sam, band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand
If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't, well then you wicked
Such is life, odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark grays, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscopes into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals, vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And tell me of the spinning mothers
And today's mathematics for belovers
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers
How was your day? Can I make what you say?
What I wanna hear 'cause I want you here
The hell that we raised to the heavens do anything for
La petite mort, la petite mort
They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like probably in the eye
What of the chicken? What is it missin', is it dry?
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed
And the tension from its demise pulled all of the flavor from the fat
And made it flat and rather lifeless
Well there's a place that has a stunning turbot and more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices, it's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices
My son will call risotto rices, if and when he's left to his own devices, well
How is your memory?
Is it returning like a lemon tree to bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me?
Or was it slippin' like permission, am I trippin' like field?
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth, maybe like kosher beef
Is it real, is it real, is it real? Haha
Howl at the day, can I make you my prey?
'Cause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear
The hell that we raised to the heavens make cemeteries for
Our petite mort, our petite mort
So glad you're back
But not glad at that you're glad
Where is the glamour in collapse?
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon, the atelier slowly fills with baboons
That other monkey business
Where killers go free cause a junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets, somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter
How are your chains, do they make you behave?
Keep you over here, by your overseer
Fallen from grace down from heaven to memories floor
La petite mort, la petite mort"

Now little Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop told 'em lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag; take the pennies out the drawer
Little Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck in the school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots and black hair
He gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass
(Verse One: Lupe Fiasco)
I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs, then we can get a soccer ball
That's what my commander say
How old? Well, I'm like 10, 11
Been fightin' since I was like six or seven
Now I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government want me dead, so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher, but I'm still too young
This cannon give me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear
If I'm in your dreams, then your end is near
(Chorus: Nikki Jean)
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
There's a war, but the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We need you now
(Verse Two: Lupe Fiasco)
Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A macabre parade of the toys he made
And shemaghs and shades who look half his age
About half the size of the flags they wave
And camouflaged suits made to fit youths
'Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a little loose
With AK-47's that they shootin' into heaven
Like they tryin' to kill the Jetsons
It's Struggle's little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, devoid of all childish ways
Can't write they own names or read the words that's on they own graves
Think you, gangsta? Popped a few rounds?
These kids'll come through and murder a whole town
Then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down
(Chorus: Nikki Jean)
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
There's a war, but the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We need you now
(Verse Three: Bishop G)
Imagine if I had to console the families
Of those slain I slayed on game consoles
I aim, I hold, right trigger to squeeze
Press ""up,"" then ""Y,"" one less nigga breathe
""B"" for the bombs, press ""pause"" for your moms
Make the room silent, she don't approve of violent games
She leave, resume activity
Start and blow hearts apart, sharp wizardry
Next part, I insert code to sweeten up
The little person's murder workload
I tell 'em they work for
CIA with a
A operative, I operate this game all day
I hold the controller connected to the soldier with weapons on the shoulder
He's only seconds older than me
My playful but serious
Now keep that online for online experience
(Chorus: Nikki Jean)
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
There's a war, but the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use

We're all chemicals, vitamins, and minerals
And vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get 'em to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling?
That's buried living and cherry picking every lemon
From your berry system then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers, and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on they hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd game make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Back-up the wordplay playing at the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fanbase
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine that hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman, whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's rainin'
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
But reign like Queens that reign over made man
And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen
But Queen like white glove wave hand
And not wave hand like it's a heat wave so you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking wave like you saying, ""Hey, man""
And not hay for horses and hoarse like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording 'cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor but now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots in floor to ceiling windows for my peep pots
A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beatbox
So the sun rise when the beat drop and the sun dies when the beat stops
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapsed, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
'Cause he want what we got, like yeah
Yeah, uh
Then forge poetry like a young honorary Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbety from the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery coming down gorgeously
Just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water boarding Barbie doll
A river of women like a Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets down at Madri Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position was black condition and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not apt to listen unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside a Apple prison
Chicken hack and download updates that lack religion or are we more
Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through the eye holes in my oil paintings
Uh, ain't nothin' to it but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris
The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear to never change my chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the motherfuckin' forest
As I perform a nerve storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations, slave to my concentration
So that's OJ da Juiceman meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug to judge who was who drew blood
And Lupe look at all these toucans
In a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
Levitating youths who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buccaro roof painting tunnels onto the mountainsides
A thousand parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies
Chocula counts by the count of five
Refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat, Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who's the boss if isn't Alyssa Milano?
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well
Sound Village, Leaf Village, wolf spirit, magic spells, yeah, uh
Dodging rain and catching hail
Faces need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool, yeah
Said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off of the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes?
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practicing stillness
Real still till he realizes his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance, yeah"

Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won't erase

The good and the bad
I'll never forget you
I'll never let you go

I'll always remember
I hope you know
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Lupe:
Let the record reflect the records we set
Best foot forward for every step
Let's push towards it. Never regress
Let's remember, if ever we get
Down, the places that we came from 'round
And all the good times on the bad side of town
The up side of bad flip it upside down
Came from the bottom but we up high now
Believe and from this view we achieved
We look back at the rules we received
And how we broke those, dismantled and rewrote those
And the ghost still alive in the photos
Sounds of the summer didn't go wise
Cold wind blowin' through a city on fire
Moments of the past came here to find you
Not to relive them, just to remind you

Lupe:
Let the evidence show the future's so bright
It's never been more, not like tonight
We walk into the glow, right into the light
The past all around us, the time of our life
The first love kisses, the broke heart disses
This is just like a first class ticket
Back to the first written rap
Crumbled up paper and a pen with no cap
The hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat
The hookers on the corner and the kids selling crack
The needles in the yard where we used to play catch
Stories from the projects we could never go at
Or to. These are shades of my youth
Trials of a child, everything truth
Moments of the past coming back to find us
Not to relive them just to remind us
John Legend:
Take me to that old familiar place
Take me to memories we won't erase
Take me to all that we had
The good and the bad
I'll never forget you

I'll always remember
I hope you know
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Lupe:
Everything cherished, Remembered in my heart
You will never perish, You will never part
I'll tell 'em all about you, drummin' in the park
We put you in the ground but I see you in the stars
Go on take a bow, a round of applause
The best that ever- always ready we are
Love always shines, that's how I'll find you
In case you forgot, I hope this reminds you now.

'Cause we love you so much
Keep it real
I don't feel what you feel though
You don't feel what I feel so
It all started out
See first I had patience and a nigga had energy
But now I'm weak, definitely
Pedi to the pedal, you finna speed
You remind me of, of my Jeep
But off in the future, and what it's finna be
All your memories can become enemies
So let's intercede, I know you in the seat
But let's get outta that, before it's injuries
At first I had patience but then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin' turned to wasting my time, my time, my time
And then that wasting turned to hating and then that hating got to racing
All around my mind, my mind, my mind
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away with no scratches (No scratches)
See first they had patience
But niggas start getting sick, niggas start getting ill
Niggas got cold feet, niggas start getting chills
Niggas start staying home 'cause niggas start getting bills
Building up an immunity, niggas stopped getting hurt
Niggas relied on faith, hopin' niggas get healed
It's hopeless nigga, get real
But ah, get back on the pill, we in it for the feel
But even winners can earn sinner
Patience but then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin' turned to wasting your time, your time, your time
And then that wasting turned to hating and then that hating got to racing
All inside your mind, your mind, your mind
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away with no scratches (No scratches)
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away with no scratches (No scratches)
First we had patience
Mini-Bar raided, in the IndyCar faded
Five hundred miles, it's pretty far ain't it?
But it's a pretty car, ain't it?
Pretty hard painted but pretty darn dangerous
But we ain't get the memo, hangin' out the window
They don't care no more, tryna take as many to a limo
Without a helmet then you can Thelma-it
Louis, Louise but we on the same thing so I be James Dean
So your wreck and my wreck look like the same scene
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away with no scratches (No scratches)

Have dream in New Orleans,
Fall in love in Chicago.
Man.
I love her
And I hate to leave her lonely.
Ring, ring went the iPhone.
It was my homie.

If we can make 'em jam,
We can make a hundred grand,
Spend in the south of France.""

To Rome,
Or home,

Real.
All in together,

Tell a stewardess to throw a movie
On the real,
Heat up my Kosher meal,
Exchange my dollar bills,
Lean back in my first class seat,
And sleep.
Don't wake me till I land
Where they barely understand
What I speak,
But they nod to my
Beats.
I tell my fans who I am
And they stand
And they clap, they applaud.
They love me, my God.
Otsukare sama deshita
Or maybe au revoir
Esprit on St. Henry
And back to Charles de Gaul.
So I can get home and tell her
Everywhere that I've been and
Everything that I've done and
Tell her that she's the one and um

And wake up in Tokyo,
Have dream in New Orleans,
Fall in love in Chicago.

Camelback 'cross the desert sands,
And take a train

House
With a bunch of souvenirs
And a smile for your mouth.
I really missed you. Each and
Every night I kissed you
In my dreams 'fore I went to sleep
To La-la land to count them sheep.
I swear you're looking prettier than ever.
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together
Evermore.
For better or less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure
X's on the shore.
I know my world tour is like war to you.
But Ian said, ""Aloha.""
And Harley said, ""Cheers.""
Julian said, ""Bonjour.""
Vigo was like ""Yeah!""

Wondering when we're going there
Edison sends his love,
So does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls.
But I revoked my membership,
All for my tenderness.
She said, ""Pursue your interests,
'Cause even if I'm ticketless,
I'll be there
By your side,
In your heart,
On your mind.""
So as I taxi down another runway,
I gotcha. Who loves you, babe?
Now bring it back, now
Let's go to sleep in Paris,
And wake up in Tokyo,
Have dream in New Orleans,
Fall in love in Chicago.

Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, land
Punching on the glass
Scared that some killer might fuck him in the ass
Staff getting rigid, wasn't gonna take away the visits
Segregate niggas by theyself and make 'em stay with it
Wicked, swung the shank around on a mop string
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT Team
That's a cop team, they sent hella cops, to stop, the helicoptering
Man, he thought that he'd fly away, like a kite, take flight
Like a letter on a string, like propellers on a wing
But the kite was the key
They made electric chairs for his dying days
Last meals, no appeals for him to try and stay
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac
Maybe he could dig a tunnel out of A Block
And wear gloves for the razor-wired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box
Looking at the world through the TV
And they gone, rapping over beats from the tabletops
Ay, that's how it is in a police state
When your life is just a number and release date
When you're rehabilitated so correctly
And let's hope that's how you're living when you're set free
Love is Looking Over Various Errors
And Hate is Habitually Accelerating Terror
Everywhere but the mural
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I don't wanna be accepted; not as all as I am

The orange wings of the new Jim Crow are dyed Klansman sheets and court papers
Dreadlocks nooses hang from his neck as the new Jim Crow
Corporations feed him seeds, yet unborn
He'll be captured by Mya, in a ruby-encrusted cage
I see the light at the end of the tunnel, and answers that I leave in empty pages to be written
Where is your pen? The new Jim Crow
The new Jim Crow, the new Jim Crow
Crow, Crow, Crow, Crow

They ain't twelve, they old, niggas old as hell
Old as jail, old as cells
Sold so much salt, ain't no more salt on the shelves

You could look like us, you know shit get through
You should be in cuffs like us, you should get strike two
You should get like life, you should get like woo
You should get that twice, you should get refused

Over your own soul, so control, your own remote control, that your folks can hold
You better watch these niggas, en garde
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these niggas and throw away the key

Fifth year with the DOC, you can see what's CO see
Robocop opt his COP, three hots and a C-O-T
Lived in a small town, his whole life
Never left, soundin' like the hole, right?
Either working at the prison, or it's no lights
In the system working with the po-lice
In the prison stripping niggas phone rights
Got a malice, on the other side of the bars
Watching niggas get smart, watching niggas get strong
Watching niggas get home, he jail us
But deep down he jealous
With each sweep down, he tell us
With each beatdown, he help us
Wrong one gon' knock his ass out though
It's why he gotta lock all the niggas out for
Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound?
It's why they treat niggas like shit
Writing raps to the taps, keep the face mask on 'em these niggas might spit
You better watch these niggas, en garde
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas

That means I'mma be the king once the king done
If he don't wanna leave then I might have to guillotine him
I sing some but I rap a lot like the king's son
Microphone checker all across the board you should king him
(Diamond) mine my mind make princesses like (King) (Come)
Every second worth of thinking
Is enough to fill three rings like Ringling's
That's how I kept it on the air is like a re-run
And kept the kings comin' in obscene sums
You see for me it's life or death like a king thumb
Mean something
That's why I don't play when I relay like a team run
And treat every single day like a scene one
Outlook on life like I ain't never seen none

The latest famous 80's baby like the dingo
Who evaded pushing daisies, dodge bullets like Remo
Remember like Ginkgo when we used to play bingo
Used to be in awe with the pushers and the pimps oh
Now I flip cars like the ribs on the Flintstones
Haters got mad and as sensitive as shinbones
Had a Goodyear and my intention is to blimp on
Even if I'm injured I'm gonna limp into the end zone
From game one to the super like Karrine dome
That mean I went to Disney World and you just went home
It's Lupe and I ain't from there
But they root for the away
Yeah they stunned there
Beautifully I play
Gatorade the coach and tubas need to play now

And I'm'a keep it magic as a Harry Potter wand swing
And my little shop with my terracotta pot

Lemme put you on game (gunshot)
Lemme put you on game
Don't you know that I run this place,
And I've begun this race,
Must I rerun this pace?
I'm the reason its become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
(Lemme put you on game)
They love my darkness,
I make them heartless,
And in return, the have become my martyrs,
I've been in the poem of many a poet,
And I reside in the art of many a artist
(Lemme put you on game)
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this
But they're fruitless in their harvest
The drow grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow,
I am the one that they march with
(Lemme put you on game)
Through the back alleys
And the black markets,
The Oval Offices,
The crackhouses and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens,
The pages of the sages
And the Chambers of The Kings
(Lemme put you on game)
Through the veins-es of the fiends,
A paper chaser's pager,
Yo, I'm famous on the scene
One of the oldest, most ancient-est of things
Speak every single language on the planet, kna'mean?
(Lemme put you on game)
I am the American dream,
The rape of Africa
The undying machine,
The overpriced medicine,
The murderous regime,
The tough guy's front,
And the one behind the scenes
(Lemme put you on game)
I am the blood of this city,
It's gas, water, and electricity,
I'm it's gym, and it's math, and it's history,
The gunshots in the class
And you can't pass if you're missin', G.
I taught them better than that
I taught them aim for the head
And hope they never come back
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby,
Hope he never comes back,
I hope he's with your mother,
With my hustlers high in my traps
(Lemme put you on game)
I hope you die in his trash,
I can't help it all I hear when you're crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag,
Behind the hospital little baby,
Crack addicts had
(Lemme put you on game)
Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper,
A welfare-receiving prostitute
And gold digger,
You can watch on TV,
How they should properly depict you,
The rivers should flow with liquor,
Quench your thirst on my elixirs,
(Lemme put you on game)
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader,
The number one defender,
And from a throne of their bones I rule,
These fools are my fuel
So I make them Cool
(Lemme put you on game)
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool,
And feed 'em from the table that held the Corleone's food,
If you die, tell 'em that you played my game
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name,
'Cause I'm the... (gunshot)"

Something that could make her move, something she could feel, feel, feel, feel
Lust, sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything he crushed
Ruined everything he loved, he just wanted the rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt, with the devil, chasing after the dust
Make a fuss if it's them, but we hush if it's us
That's why, my mama said she wanted something real, real, real, real, real
Something she could be proud of, something she could feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
She said they so used to not having nothing real, real, real, real, real
That they don't know how to act, they don't know how to feel, feel, feel, feel
Life ain't meant to come around twice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest now I gotta give it light
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that, God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good so, God gave me plight
If I wake up in the morning now I gotta give 'em sight
Make 'em see, break 'em free, ain't a G, show you right
The game is not to give 'em nothing real, real, real, real, real
Nothing they could use, nothing that they could feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's real, real, real, real, real
So that's all that they know, that's all that they feel, feel, feel, feel
Struggle, yeah, yeah, another sign that God love you

Keep they names in my rhymes to try and keep them out of trouble
'Cause bein po', also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own, I can hit them with a couple
Cuff my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can, on the man, up above you
That's why, I gotta give 'em something real, real, real, real, real
Something they could recognize, something they could feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em something real, real, real, real, real
Something that'll make 'em stop, something they can feel, feel, feel, feel
Yo, FNF are real
Really real

Road to peace is closed, heavy traffic on the war paths
Love is boiling on the budget
The military says it's gonna need more cash
To keep fighting for your gas
Keep us in our hoods and hope we never explore past
Stay inside of your half
Believe the lies you learned in your class
That there's no treasure in your trash

Think inside the box and follow all procedures
Never ever believe that you will never need this
Hit up all your friends and tell them to repeat this
Higher on the air, not what you want to hear
But we ain't got the truth, but how about a remix
Different is never good, good is only what we pick
You ain't got a hit unless it sounds like these did

Independent spirits, you can barely hear what they're saying
Truth ain't getting on like shampoo on an airplane
Propaganda's everwhere, constantly on replay
All the hits, all the time, back to back on relay
But really where it lives
Make them hear the records we play
Build your own station, become your own DJ
You must be a radio station

When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons' abs
I'm telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
The system is a slab
Corruption is the swinger sittin' high ridin' dirty, drag racin into danger
And it's so clean, pine trees smellin good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I can't shed blood on any battlefield of yours
I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor

I shed tears, I don't know what really matters anymore

Embedded they go, no eyelids gone low
Or gone by sundown, they're dodging 5-0
Now as I wander through the city goin' mad
I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag
Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doin' bad
Then the separation from the truth is gettin' vast, fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money
Delighted by the dummyin down of the importance of crowns we'll never have
That's why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath
Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath
Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be livin' off your sad
Hatin' on your happiness you hit 'em off with laughs
Smile till they surrender, then you kill 'em off with glad
Hello evil, I'm back

76,Streets on Fire,2007,The Cool (2007),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"(Intro - Matthew Santos)
Tonight...
The stars are aligned and the planets colliding
And the plan is arriving and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
Your parents are goners, no children to mourn
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
These bombs are our babies and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of your rival
The pimps and the rise of your pulse, where you'll find her
Hey hey 
(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
(Verse One - Lupe Fiasco)
Disease, the virus is spreadin' in all directions
No safe zone, no cure and no protection
No symptoms to find, the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies and no corrections
Quarantine your dreams and sever all connections
Don't let 'em in not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and wants you to have it next and
Don't accept 'em if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit, some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war 
Invented by the press just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
""Whores,"" say the nuns, ""nuns,"" say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientists say, ""it only infects the mind""
The little boy said, ""it only infects the girls""
The preacher man said, ""it's gonna kill off the soul""
A bum said, ""it's gonna kill the whole wide world""
(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight
(Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco)
Believe! Some say the neon signs by the loud speakers repeatin' that everything is fine
A subtle silence to demolish the trouble conscience of accomplished with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted from the masses to the masses from the antennaes on top of the shrines
Was fine and received and planted during the panic and surely it reports back everything in your mind
Everything is lyin', everything is dyin'
Everying is a rule, everything is a crime
Everything was here then everything rewind
New weather burned the feathers off everything flyin'
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit, the lavish, the fastest, the clashes
The ashes to ashes, everything intertwined
My femme fatale, my darlin' fallen angel
Once caught her changin' the batteries in her halo
Receipt for wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
The scientist said, ""she's already inside my mind""
The little boy said, ""what happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said, ""she's gonna kill off the soul""
The dope boy said, ""it's the whole wide world""

Yeah, woo
Uh, alright
Yeah, alright
Fresh to death she is
From her steps to her set she is
So death might not let me live, ya dig
Fresh, uh-huh, yes she is
Had a feeling that it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind, don't play like this, naw
But I'm prepared for it, got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs, even cut my hair for it
'Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be looking for light like that, then there go it
Yeah, right over there, so I prepared to pour it
Little scared, my stare lowered, momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already out of my chair
Gather up my Airs on my square from here for it
It's nothing, right so here go it, whispered in her ear
It's kinda crowded in here would she care to blow it and she said, ""Yeah""
You're my sunshine (You're my sunlight)
You're my moonlight (You're my moonlight)
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me?
Think I found love in this club tonight, whoa, whoa
Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor, it's hard to get
In the car we sit from the intro
She rolled down the window, just in case I was a schizo
I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm, a little more confident
Uh huh, and then we lose consciousness
She says that, ""I've been waiting for you
And I know you've been chasing me too
Since they kidnapped me from a castle, I've been thinking of you
I told a fire-breathing dragon he better not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor, yes you be""
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said, ""See too beautiful to let you sleep
You're my sunshine""
You're my sunshine (You're my sunlight)
You're my moonlight (You're my moonlight)
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me?
Think I found love in this club tonight, whoa, whoa (Yeah, uh)
Relationship is just thirty minutes long
It's kinda heavy, maybe a little strong
Gonna take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two, 'fore I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me, out of the trillions
Of numbers that's in the world just leave me a few
That lead to you, won't be long then
I'll see you in the morning, cool
You're my sunshine (You're my sunlight)
You're my moonlight (You're my moonlight)
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me?
Think I found love in this club tonight, whoa, whoa
You're my sunshine 
You're my moonlight
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you please come down and hug me?
Think I found love in this club tonight, whoa, whoa"
78,Superstar,2007,The Cool (2007),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check two one two
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?
Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me
I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid
And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autographed picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha...
Ha ha ha ha ha... ha
If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
If you are that they say you are - a superstar

A shark shirt, a panther's pants, piranha hat and tiger shoes
I got a lion's den inside the booth
That right there is point blank
This here is from where the sniper shoot
Might take a long time to get it, by the time I hit it
I done ran Bubble Tape around them Chiclets, poof
I ain't the bomb, I'm the company that got the contract
To rebuild during the aftermath - have a blast
Going green only using half the gas
The calming comes through after disasters have
But this calm has the same fury that disasters have
I should have a class, I'm the son/sun of the South Pole plus Alaska's dad
Got niggas like ""DAG!"", flow is like crazy gone mad
And villains gone bad, Punk ass niggas, don't be so Daft
Baby, why you hanging with them Busters like Babs?
They are such a drag, you should move them to the trash
Feel like I'm walking round upon Cassius calves
Quite a beautiful script, and such a gift of gab
A big bass, shout out to Mistah F.A.B
Young Frankenstein reporting live from the lab
I bought the bars out, put it on my tab
If you came here to box, you'll leave in a bag
I run the game, Bilderberg Group, in the lead with the flash
Usain Bolt ain't even leaving this fast
Why you take offense with your defensive ass?
Never Hussein-ing the hole/whole, not even in the half
Cause nigga I ain't hiding, I'm the whole world, nigga you're an island
And the sea's rising, if I keep shining
You going have to take submarines to the drive-in now"

Yeah...
Cool.
Turn it up
Uh-huh...
Yeah...
He came back
In the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grand father was married in
Yes... he was still fresh to death
Bling, 2 ear-rings, a chain laying on his chest
He still had it 'cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like 2 inches behind it
Smell the Hennesey from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory, he didn't mind it, But...
He couldn't sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just filling the casket up
Floating down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second Grade hand-writing simply read ""I miss ya""
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it one of his man's stuck a swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soaking
Saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open
And he...
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You go and you live then you die...
O-oh-oh-oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you breaking the rules
Making your moves
Paying your dues...
Chasing the cool
Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt spit... swallowed it
Working like a... hmm... reverse archaeologist
Except... his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed on to some grass, he climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped 6 months after the shots
That had got him in the box wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours because he wasn't older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulders ... so...
With a right hand that was all bones and no reason to stay
Decided to walk home
So he...
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You go and you live then you die...
O-oh-oh-oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you breaking the rules
Making your moves
Paying your dues...
Chasing the cool
He begged for some change to get him on a train
""Damn that nigga stank"", is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look... Wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter fact only thing on his brain was brains... yeah
And getting back in his lane, doing his thang
First he had to find something to slang
Next stop was his block
It had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked that some little niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there
So they pulled out and robbed him
With the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said ""You scared ain't you?""
He said: ""Hustler for death. No heaven for a gangsta.""
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You go and you live then you die...
O-oh-oh-oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you breaking the rules
Making your moves
Paying your dues...
Chasing the cool."

I love the Lord, but sometimes it's like that I love me more
I love the peace and I love the war
I love the seas and I love the shore
No love for no beach, baby that's law
But she doesn't see therefore I spoil
I trip, I fall, run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness,
Stat-us, placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers,
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glows green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene, our obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen, I could be her king, together
She would make me cool and we would both rule forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure ever again
And if the rain stops and every thing's dry
She would cry just so I could drink the tears from her eyes
She teach me how to fly
Even cushion my fall if my engines ever stall
And I plummet from the sky
But she would keep me high
And if I ever die she would commission my image on to her bosom
Or maybe she'd retire as well
A match made in Heaven, set the fires in Hell and I'll be

And pray to God that the flood subside
'Cause you gonna need a sub till he does reply
And not one of Jared's, you think it's all errant
And everything's ivory, another supply
That means anotha July inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the Unger
Felix, 'cause he is the cleanest
Amongst the younger outstanding achieving up-and-comers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and well-to-do mommas
But not well enough to keep 'em from us
The ones that were fightin' in class who might not pass
Rap record pressured the lab, had a life not fast
""Can you feel it? Can you feel it?"" That's what I got asked
""Do I love her? Do I love her?"" Said, ""I don't know""
Streets got my heart, Game got my soul
One times when sunshine would never hurt your soul
To a cryin' dishonored baby momma
Who's a momma to her daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes and a necklace with a solid gold key like the starter of a car
The opener of a door, or two pounds of raw

But they say where you goin', you ain't even gon need it
They see you ridin' round, shinin with your fine round diamonds
Pretty green eyed lady
Been on tha sideline plottin, while you primetime poppin'
Hungry niggas want a piece of your pastry
I suggest you protect your bakery
'Cause they comin' for your head,
And it's a bounty on that chain that's hangin' from your neck

Till the world, blow up, they said I was so finished
I told 'em its show business
Meanin' there's no business, 'less Fiasco's in it
Disrespect the dress code, wear my street clothes in it
Measured, sold, and clothed in it
Opened up closed, after I entered and drove in it, like uh
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep
Roll in it, music bumpin, windows tinted
Through they good neighbourhoods and all of the wolves in it
Exerted control in it
Seen it come and go, stolen and sold in it
Diamond and gold blinted
Fountain of youth, dippin my toes in it
Bounce in the booth, spit it like Skoal Minted
Putting my heart and my soul in it
Cause
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep
Once upon a time, not long ago
When the pusher man creep, where they live life po'
With fifteen in the clip and one in the hole
Hallway wall full of bricks, only some of us know
None of us know the makers of the toast
Like the bottom of the stove, that was used in the murderin' of the scroll
Heart colder than Edy's
Won't let the seedy city defeat me
Rub me out like genies, won't concede till I'm graffiti
Nigga what
Only fear God

And never fall asleep

Hell met like Rydell, then high-water, hello
To the five-year-old gunshot hearer, I hear ya
Clearer than the invisible man in the mirror
Cheer up, I put it on the bars like beer nuts
Put a bug in they ear, so from here up, they hear us
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep
Once upon a time, not long ago
When the pusher man creep, where they live life po'
I put it on my grandmomma's daughter
My microphone control of the soul of slave hummin ""Wadin in the Water""
I author like D.W. brother, like a hustla
God place me in ya armor, I prescribe no partnas
I do it for the hood like a parka
And tell my niggaz not to shiver
Only time we quiver like a archer is
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep
Here we are now, entertain us
Change don't change us
Ever since the game trained us
We came up like worms in the rain
I dream my chain became a loose noose that was used to hang us
So now, my insane brain, my 32 teeth
And two feet creep like its Elm Street
Cause
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep
Once upon a time, not long ago
When the pusher man creep, where they live life po'

He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes
Everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it
He mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box, but he can't remember how to stop it
Uh! So he continues to watch it
Open that and then give him something that he can box with
Or how to locksmith
See the box is, locked in a box, ain't got the combination to unlock it
That's why he wa-tches, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might show him
What to take off the locks with
So he chained hisself to the box, took a lock, and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils

He does it anything it tell him to get
He shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it inna box when he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps

Your attention please, your attention I need it
So I can sit you in a position from which I see it
Where I'm seated is scenic
Heavy-weighter, slim as the Machinist, so bulimic
Which means you somewhere in between it
I take it back for you like the Wild Stallions (Wyld Stallyns) of San Dimas
I'm in the market for low-mile 360 Medinas
And a good organic cleaners
My car always a winner
Your cars always pity
We should call it Stanley Steamers
Most of my friends in gangs
My new nickname is Ghengis Khan
But without the Ye, but his last names my side
I ride with the demeanors (the meanest)
I'm armed to the teeth
You're Venus and you've never been to the Dinas (dentist)
School of Hard Knocks, I dean it
I done it, as well as a celebrated alumnus
I donate to the campus and my names on the arenas
But you can't bring it to my court
Not even with subpoenas
Cause you can't play my sport
But you can still cheer-lead us
And you can't sit there
That sections for the seniors
And the sexy senoritas
So just move up to the bleachers
How you gonna school me when I grew up with your teachers
I know that you can't hear me
'Cause I blew up all the speakers
And the power line is hanging
'Cause I threw up all the sneakers
I ate up the imposters
And I chewed through all the pizzas
I blacked out with a black card
And I maxed out all the Visas

Just walk across my stage
Your life will be completed
Don't need financial aid
Cause this is just some free shit
You been properly prepared
Throw your hats up in the air
I'm red hot, Chilly, (Red Hot Chili) I'm Anthony Kiedis
My spirit smells teenage

This is civil disobedience
How you gon make hip-hop
Without all the ingredients?
Lot of mouths to feed
Plus a lot of greediness
And that greed, outshines the neediness
What n-ggas need is some question they authority
And tune out all the TV sh-t
And we be this
So I give 'em more

I just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out
And what's written on her titties is what its really about
Then her vagina is some poor kids from China
Nipples nuclear missiles
Ass is a daughter without a dad
Back is like Afghanistan, Iraq
Health care hair
Drive by thighs
Education lips
HIV eyes
Environment feet
Justice get her so wet, brains get you brains
You can f-ck her if you protest
But before you bust in her face, finish listenin to the tape

Ugh, I can't feel a feel nigga pain, devious skill

They cane they dismemberers of switchas then refill it with the jane
Then they tilt it and they lit with a flame then they took a pull that kill her
To tha brain like (inhale noise) ah
Evil minded like crane
They became deranged like the rover that I rolled
That was the waynes that I drove when I was a little bit older
Mayne declaring war on the deck like they the joker
All while they duckin from bruce wayne
While they poker with the devil
And our moonlitten ghetto
Hello my name stickers on the stickers of the veins
In rehab remembering the feelings when they used to get mellow
When they was all back of a nigga like monachello
When the underworld had to be smarter than donatello
No honour amongst fellows
It's harder than sittin' with a blind man and tryin' to describe yellow
Got me feelin' like killer joe

Repeat it on my way to the liquor store, chocolate

'Cause I can't feel the feel
Niggas chains
Though I covered mine, so I covered mine in bling
Then I bumped into a bum and covered mine in shame
Then I bumped into a hun and uncovered mine again
Diamonds been underminded mayne, they give a nigga with no mac another kinda game
See money talks in another kinda slang
Detectives can't decipher as they listen through the wire as I accept the call
And listen to the life of
Gettin' religion and makin' voodoo in the sink of your cell
Recitin il-faatihah in the kitchen
In deed on his deem and in addittion to doin' dishes
Listen as I schooled on the rules to rule
Fuel of fools, the obstacles, the cool
Had to slow it down homey
Chopped and screwed
Blow it down for me
Sticks and stones make the homes
Only god's words can stop the wolves
And don't fraternise with pigs those kids will think your stool
Not at the bar but tryin' to put him behind the bar like a bartender
He laid the law like the bar so I put it in a bar for dude
He said borrow my jewels and bar the fools
'Cause they a playa like the space bar and twos
Theme music to a drive-by, put it in your car and cruise"

Too much pride we electric slide, we should be closer
Like soca, not a chain but a choker
I see the sun then the clouds then the vultures
Pay respects in my sensei's sculpture
High as the angel on the Dikembe's shoulder
Eyes looking like MKUltra
Redacted vision through these dark shades
Bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
Hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak
Park full of art, arteries full of parkay
Beating it like new games, easily defeating
Or two gangs meeting for the evening
Or two feet on a Riesling, slow wind
Meditate until there's no mind
Decorate me with shine till I go blind
BDSM dominated it with no bind
Safe word is don't stop, both or don't go no times

Coolest, tulips, flowers, fall from the towers
Like balls from Galileo to lay low
Ignorance is that the world isn't ours, the gall
Give them all showers
Tony found the fountain of youth, in the mountain of powder
To only find truth in the fountain, drowning in power
Surrounded with dollars
The moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder
Cut, that's a mis-direct to stir the soul with dis-effect
Names don't last like Mr. X
Unless you Galilee, dropping bowling balls on the discotheque
With a disco ball hanging 'round your neck
Dance, it's a new year
Every time I open my hands
Thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal
Yokozunas throwing salt in the circle
Sumo you up off off your turf boy
Tsunami you up off your surfboard
Midas turn Medusas into gold
'Fore Versace turned words into turquoise
Medusa turned coke into stone
With a hand on her thigh, she looked me in the eye and said

Come so far, seen so much (Tron)
I cannot settle for good enough (Proceed to the next level)
So I'll sweat and I'll climb until I reach my prime
The forces rise and fall again
Through it all, I'll reach the end
In my eyes, there's a fire and it takes me high
Uh, yeah, Soulo
Shoot for the moon, even if you miss you'll be among the stars (Space)
Backstroke in my pool of thought but don't mind the sharks (Wavy)
Ab-solar system intergalactic soldier
Lupe say I'mma stoner, I say that I'm much bolder
Trapped in a game where the trap is the game
Scope this horror, Aquariuses make it rain here
No love for your honor, only God can judge us
If you're Islamic, Allah, I've had it up to my collar
With these niggas castin' stones like this Mancala
Proceed to the next level, dig that with a platinum shovel
Black magic, matter of fact, if matter is fact
A matter factory is in the making perhaps

91,Till I Get There,2011,Lasers (2011),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"Album on hold, whole world on hold
Crowd is like ""Ho!"" operator's like ""Hold"" (Please hold)
Man, now ain't that cold, I'm just tryin' to talk to my homie
That's up in the hole. And homegirl not tryin' to be a ho
Even though she on the pole, can she get a second chance? No.
Whoa. Like the opposite of go. That ain't how it's supposed to be
A butterfly, but for the sake of rhymin' let's just say butterflyee
The truth stings like Muhammad Ali.
I tell 'em tell 'em don't homicide me
I'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
Fightin' for his fans and fightin' for his folks
But the boos from the crowd can become so loud
If I can block 'em out then I can knock 'em out and
Dance around the ring but until then I'll sing
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and this how it's gon' be
Until I get there, Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there, When I get there
Doctor, Doctor, please, the fame ain't painless enough
""That's 'cause you ain't famous enough
You got a little game, but your name ain't ringin' enough,""
He said, ""Take two of these put some change in my cup""
I said I wasn't poor he gave me some more
Prescribed me a publicist, and pointed to the door
Out. Ouch. I'm tellin' you this all from a therapist's couch
""Tell me 'bout your mother. What she's all about?""
Prescribed me an interview and then told me to bounce.
Damn. Geeze. The world is so cold I'm glad I bought these skis.
Went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees.
Rendered unconscious, they rushed me to a concert
Instead of green jello, and made me chicken soup
They fed me magazine covers and video shoots
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and this how it's gon' be
Until I get there, Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there, When I get there
And when I finally make it I'ma stunt so hard
Evil as Knievel, I'ma jump so far
Way up in the atmosphere, I ain't coming back
Be a jerk to them jerks, yeah that'll make 'em hurt
""Huh?"" said a young boy in the mirror
A young version of me, so I started to tear up
He said, ""You need to cheer up, Your mind need to clear up
You're already here. Just be yourself from here up""
Then he disappeared and I felt something familiar
Something I was taught, something I had lost
If you are afraid or fear that you gon' change some
All you gotta do is just remember where you came from
I'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me
It is what it is and this how it's gon' be
Until I get there, Till I get there
And yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
When I get there, When I get there"

Send lighting to your mind
And make you move

I lead them through the harm like a Hero
Peaceful, but I can bring the violence
Like Nero
Right to your keyhole
Then bring it back to silence

I don't trust America after watching zeitgeist
Take a look at my stripes, chest look like a tiger arm
And I'm hot as tiger baum, fire like a five alam
And its set to tie a barn, get ya firefighter on
I ain't worried 'bout you hoes, I don't even need to roll
I turn down yo X like how you put yo tires on
Once I get these tires on I buy a bomb and tie it on
And ride this around the entire song
Find a line to drive it on, park it near a metaphor
Wait for it, the timers on
You can turn yo hydrants on, I'll jus turn my wipers on

94,Unforgivable Youth,2012,Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1 (2012),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"This world, my heart, my soul.
Things that I don't know.
The icicles they grow.
They never let me go.
Scars are left as proof.
But tears they soak on through.
Things I've done.
My young.
My unforgivable youth.
We land on the horizon. The passion in their eyes then.
What they think of islands and much more in their size.
Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them.
Supplies slim. Morale when so heavily inside them.
Now steadily declining.
Return is not an option as necessity denies them.
With this they choose to dive in.
Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving.
Other children of this land prepare to share in their surviving.
A pigeontry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure.
Now the material things that kings that could never last forever.
But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together.
Unbenounced to him his head would be the first that they would sever.
And stuck up on a pike up along the beach.
Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs.
And so began it here. And for 500 years.
Torture, Terror, Fear till they nearly disappear.
This world, my heart, my soul.
Things that I don't know.
The icicles they grow.
They never let me go.
Scars are left as proof.
But tears they soak on through.
Things I've done.
My young.
My unforgivable youth.
Ways and means from mistreated human beings.
A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine.
And helps the new regime establish and expand.
Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land.
From native caretakers who can barely understand.
""How can land be owned by another man. Warns one can not steal what was given as a gift. Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish.""
But the lesson when the heated, for the sake of what's not needed.
You kill but do not eat it.
The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it.
The forests's were cleared, the factories were built.
And your mistakes will be repeated by your future generation doomed to pay for your mistreatments.
Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement.
And you rushed to have the most, from the day you left your boats.
You'll starve but never die. In a world of hungry ghosts.
This world, my heart, my soul.
Things that I don't know.
The icicles they grow.
They never let me go.
Scars are left as proof.
But tears they soak on through.
Things I've done.
My young.
My unforgivable youth.
As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east.
Appeared 100 meters wide and 100 meters deep.
They discover ancient cars on even older streets.
And a city well preserved and most likely at it's peak.
A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth.
They can tell that they was civil, not barbaric in the least.
A society at peace. With liberty and justice for all.
Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall.
They would doubt that there was any starvation at all.
That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved.
From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade.
Everything's so organized. They had to be well behaved.
Assumed they had clean energy, but took to no enemies.
Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies.
Religions kinda complex. Kinda hard to figure out.
And this must be the temple.
This White. House
This world, my heart, my soul.
Things that I don't know.
The icicles they grow.
They never let me go.
Scars are left as proof.
But tears they soak on through.
Things I've done.
My young.
My unforgivable youth."
95,Words I Never Said,2011,Lasers (2011),Hip Hop|Midwest Rap|Alternative Hip Hop,Lupe Fiasco,"It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I can't take back the words I never said
I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullsh*t
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip
9/11, Building 7, did they really pull it?
And a bunch of other cover ups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it then they move it so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what the fucks
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering about such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh was a racist, Glen Beck is a racist, Ghaza strip
Was getting bombed but Obama didn't say shit
That's why I didn't vote for him, next one either
I'm a part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful
And I believe in the people
Yeah
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
Now we can say it ain't our fault, If we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed em
Walk with me into the ghetto, this is where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, well what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listenin to Pac ain't gonna make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gonna make it whole
If you don't become an actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with a million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash 'em down with Diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world will gladly give a loan today
So If you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away.
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said, never said
I can't take back the words I never said
I think that all the silence is worse than all violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We're scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said"
