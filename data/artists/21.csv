Uh, yeah (si papi... uh, uh-huh)
Uh-huh (I see you papi, si)
I was in Madrid yo
Had this hot club shootin my video
They was burnin up the floor to that reggaeton
Start to bailando soon as they put the record on
I was sweatin like a bullfighting matador
It was the sexiest scene that I ever saw
(La fiesta, tu mi a fuego)
But I was still cool in my light blue Kangol
I met this girl, she was off the chain yo
Cooley head model from San Diego
Father was from Trinidad, Tobago
Mother was from Rio, de Janeiro
She said please don't think I'm crazy
But I've been in love with you since the 80's
{?} Cansando baby
Have you ever been with a latin lady
Uh, she said there's one thing you should know
(Just here to find to numero uno)
Uh-huh (and I'll do anything to prove it)
(If I can get wit'cha)
Uh, she said there's one thing you should know
(Just here to find to numero uno)
Uh-huh (and it's on, one shot will do it)
(If I can get wit'cha)
(LL Cool J:)
She said I wanna get wit'cha
I'm talkin' more than an autograph and picture
(Tu quiere, benita mi casa)
I mumbled to myself, she's a monster
She said (yo no se lo que no habla)
Don't worry 'bout it lil' mama nada
The chemistry and energy was gettin' hotter
This ain't like me but I feel like I gotta
She started movin near me
Whispered in my ear so I could hear more clearly
Said grab my waist and look in the mirror
Then started windin it like Shakira
All that shakin and belly dancin
I was goin' under, I ain't stand a chance man
If I do this, will I love it or regret it
Tempted and I don't know where this is headed
(LL Cool J:)
(Wit'cha, wit'cha) Uh (uh)
Yeah (si papi, uh)
(If I can get wit'cha)
(Si papi, si) Uh-huh
(Papi) If I can't get wit'cha
Then she kept beggin sayin' let's go
Pullin on my arm, wouldn't let go
Rubbin my face, kissin' my neck slow
When we do it say hablando como {?}
She said (ooh papi te quiero mucho)
(I love you better than any woman you know)
Just then my lady hit my cell phone
I'll let y'all figure out the rest yo"
1,(NFA) No Frontin' Allowed,1993,14 Shots To The Dome (1993),,LL Cool J,"Mad madness
Trashy
Brother from way back.
We're blowin' mics since the days of 8-track.
Certified
Bonified
Pull out the weapon.
Rusted.
Your ho's gets busted.
Run your jules!
Shootin up ya damn fools.
Leavin' your loser lazy lyricist
In bloody pools.
Went away
Came back
Your still wack.
Now your slobbin Marly's mob
For a dope track.
Comin' off like a bra
And it's the witness.
No click-click
A fru (?) business
Don't care about no money
Got props in it.
Flippin scripts
With every letter in the alphabet.
Wanna jump. JUMP!
And jingle your rump. RUMP!
Here to pump punks
With real hot lead chunks.
Full-grown
I ain't no baby with these rhymes kid.
Put the mic down
My peoples know where ya live.
I chop you little brittle riddle
Right up the middle
And have the police playin' the fiddle
In the hospital.
Somebody said, ""He couldn't rip with the roughness.""
Rhymes kick your teeth
But end up frontless.
Soul survivor of a thousand beats
Sendin funeral wreathes
To all ya use-to-be chiefs.
Is a raw
To a bearlin in the woods (?).
Brothers tapes ain't jack
Their best tracks is wack.
I heard you think you got a chance to win
But my glock is stopped off
To murder the top ten.
Rough and rugged and raw
I'm like a callous.
The underground can say
""Ain't no Fra-zontin in my palace.""
Well can I be the flavor of the month?
I got the flavor
Plus I can bump a chump.
I got the funk
Straight from my underground hide-out.
I freak it in the house
And let the hits just
Ooz out.
Bust on the scene
To let ya know I wasn't frontin.
Got ya screamin for my album
So I had to do somethin'.
Write tonight
To take a bit
Not a bite.
And watch the (?)
Freak you with
All my might.
Like ""Here I am to save the day!""
I stop the tracks
With the mic
So I say ""To chay""
And ""On Guard""
When I'm swingin' for your brow.
Cause in the house of hits
Ain't no frontin allowed.
Just when you thought
That it was safe
To try and chop me.
Run for ya life
Now here somes Mr. Funky
And I'm pissed.
So watch how many heads
I'll be the takeout
Boy ya better look out
I work ya like a cook-out.
So get the flavor
The original Mr. Funky
(?)
And you watch me do my thing.
Because I hit ya with the funk
Of the fly-talker
And make your girl
""Bump-bump! Get it, Get it!""
Like Luke Skywalker.
I can't front
I love rappin' with a passion.
Crash your head front
Into the funk
You think I'm slam dancin.
See when you front
You make mad
The alter weight (?).
Freak this:
""Funky twin powers activate!""
Sheik on the mic
With the cape and muscles.
Crushin MC's
While their girls do the hustle.
See other rappers
Try to dis the lords
But yo, your dead wrong.
Damnit, can't we all just get along?
We'll see
There simply ain't no frontin allowed.
Yo, I'm out
Like the Cosby show
Peace to the Funky Child.
Punchin your god-damn eyebrows off
Roughin it up north
Lookin' like your laugh off (?).
It's a blash smash
And crash from my stash.
Be watchin your back kid.
Your girl and the phat path.
Talkin' bout your macks and tax.
What's with that?
Your gettin' wet like
Sloooow sex.
Rippin on that old school kid.
Leavin' sliced as a slit
Says I wet your crib.
No question.
Testin the west
And the east and
Once the ammo was released and
I'll make your girl come and getcha.
Hope you get the picture.
Boy your better off
If a pit bit ya!
What's it's like
In the illest fight.
Believe the hype.
I'm givin' crowds more nose jobs than Mike.
Fight sight all right
They bite
Spot light tonight
Is hype
Trigger happy tripe
Don't hit bite
My owner's right.
And ya know it's comin' off
So don't ask it.
Snatchin the vocal
And hotties on the rap tip.
Mackin ya boys up.
Bringin' the noise up.
And now ya need stitches
Because my voice cuts.
Chainsaw
Gain more
And riegn raw.
And never let a brother play it
Is my main law."
2,.357 - Break It On Down,1987,Bigger And Deffer (1987),,LL Cool J,"(LL Cool J)
That's right y'all this is the LL Cool J party
Move it, move it, move it, get on the floor baby
That's right, don't try to front like your fly
Get out there!
(LL Cool J)
To rappers I'm a nightmare on Elm Street
Hellafied hotter than heat, guess why the other's can't eat?
'Cause I'm a carnivore and I can eat much more
Than a fat man after a pack-a-jam
L.L.'s thicker than butter, well-known throw cutter
When I'm involved all the amateurs stutter
There's scared and can't believe that their whole crews
Ain't a rapper alive that can fill my shoes
I'm dope on a rope (???) water elope
I do the hustle and the shuffle and the roper dope
'Cause I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down
(LL Cool J)
Three hundred and fifty seven reasons
Why you gotta get your butt on the floor right now
We ain't playin', we came here to get ill
Iller than ill, LL youknowI'msayin?
(LL Cool J)
Just like Ali Baba and the 40 thevz
So nasty you don't know whether to stay or leave
More fear then Evan Bluebeard I serve primrose
A picture of me is like a part of Michaelango's
I don't play the banjo will you ever understand yo
Servin' I mean the matter how old I go Rambo
Cocks strong half a block wrong
Illy ill fire starter hittin harder than King Kong
Not a battle axe not one of the mill
Not easily knocked out or easily killed
'Cause I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down
(LL Cool J)
A hundred and ninety five pounds punk
More bounce to the ounce and I say what counts
KnowI'msayin?
Now get yourself on the floor
Stop actin' like a sissy
(LL Cool J)
Boy, I'm better than better is, badder than badder is
I won't scare 'em or dare 'em I'll just splatter his
Guts kick his butt while Bob is rockin' the cuts
Wanna step in the ring with me you must be mushed
Now ices in a crisis afraid when he's ready or chasin when he's chasin
But filling when the scene I mean I'm icin and acin
Amateurs who like it can't hack it I attack it that's why I'm gonna crack it
The shell and the soul of little kids who can't roll
I told em, scold em, teach 'em and mold em
Get paid ten knots at a time and then I fold em
I remember the blood and I remember what told em
I can, can't 'cause I'm down with E yet you have the audacity
To try and mess with him and me
Hypersonic is weak and Supersonic is wack
Sneak around at the minute like a Siamese cat
?Pellum? (1, 2, 3) catch twenty-two I'm H-A-R-D
I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down
(LL Cool J)
Rock the beat now that can be arranged
Yo baby you look fine spread em
Yo homeboy get up against the wall put this in your pocket
Who is this?
Move it, move it, move it
(LL Cool J)
I'm a nappy, sappy crappy imitator of who
If I ever imitated it wouldn't be you, ooh
You don't know so many have died when the LL growl was amplified
Get back better yet step back get dat
Like shaft in the Mack 'cause I'm mad and I'm black
I'm a perfect plan a good boyfriend
I'm the reason rap rules and the country out Cool J-A-M-E-S
Fresh as a cliche but so is my forte
This goes out whether the blues is old news
P's and Q's keep me in your shoes
And you're dissin me because I'm young and I'm strong
And 'cause I'm capable of makin' a platinum LP
Wrong you was, you assumed I was all in
But boy is for ballin they'll never say I'm fallin'
Callin all cars for the brother in black
L-E-L the Mack back bone of this track
I'm force full of force to put you on your back
Makin' hit after hit while you sent for a contract
Hotter than hot now watch how hot I can get
Leavin' rappers fee's dried and skimmer's dimmer's wet
I'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town
I gotta .357 and I break it on down
(LL Cool J)
Now the LL posse is now handin out speed knots
To all those who don't want to get busy
That's right baby get your body on the floor
Move it, move it
.357 at point blank range ain't nothin' strange
You're havin' a heart attack is at your back
Now listen to me bring it, bring it on, on down, down, down, down, down, down"
3,1 In The Morning,2004,The DEFinition (2004),,LL Cool J,"It's 1 in the morning (you know what time it is)
It's 1 in the morning
It's 1 in the morning (you gonna have to come out ya clothes for this one)
It's 1 in the morning (What ever you say)
Yeah I'm still at it
The microphone addict, you get you dome splatted, Cause homie would not have it
Your ashes get scattered, Across the Atlantic
For acting like you a teenage chic with a bra padded
You might laugh at it
Putting you through the knowledge
It is really a tad tragic, How they runnin' through they cabbage
You know my track record, L battle like a savage
I think it grow rich that gives me the advantage
Uncle LL, I got prodigal sales, so I could bail Al Sharpton out of jail
Somebody gotta do it
Somebody in the black community, Gotta get this money while yaw'll march for unity
So march on Ima get my Bentley park on
Then get my dawgs a platform to bark on
The realest brother Unicode hit me and wonder to others
Children shivering under the covers
The man in Black
The tilted Fedora hat
I'm bringing it raw
You never want your money back
I'm focused baby
Livin' like a quarterback
Playin' in the Wish bowl
L keeps opuses black
Systematically, burn you like calories
Watch your mouth, Go earn your little salaries
I'm a classic like Nike airs and Wallabies
You can catch it like a flu, homie follow me
That's right sleeping Beauty
Wake up see the light
That Tylenol P.M. got you caught for you B.M.
Everybody could see em', the king of ripping coliseums
Come on you is a male groupie begging for bedim
I'm fruitcake laid out in the mausoleum
I'm the richest man in Babylon
Nobody could see him
Money's my slave, it do what I say
It could cry for me, like Denzel in glory
But I broke the cycle, no more poverty
I wonder if you hating on the low, probably
But cats know I'm real
I keep them on they heels
Damn look at my body, could have been a Navy Seal
But you lack the discipline to do what I do
Reinvention, I'm in the 11th Dimension
I'm a value stock pop; get it while it's hot
'Cause once I blow ima split and that's it
Your Honor last week he punched me in the face
I want 20 million, you know he live in waste
Last week me and the president was taking' flicks
Last week my video dropped, and you were sick
Last week I copped my shorty some kicks
They cost 29 hundred, homie you don't want it
My ears stayed flooded like your man stay blooded
My American Express is Black, no other summit
The Benjamin Graham of Def Jam, yaw'll know
My portfolio was sicker than Polio
Fo' real god is good He took me out the hood
Got me living in a mansion like a big boy should
And I'd never do Cribs
I ain't gon have all yaw'll fruitcakes knowing' how I live (never!)
Bed extra big
You sit around in your mouth potbelly on the couch
Claiming you're hot but honey what you won't vow
Was she alone Puff L I make her bounce
You on the corner risking your life to sell an ounce
Wishing you was Pablo laying in Cabot with a chick named Margo
You flew from Chicago, but no
In real life cats catch you
It's not what you expected
Life's kinda hectic huh
(Yeah, Yeah it's the definition, the definition)
Go
It's the definition partner 11 in the roll"

Yo... ""Hello 1-900-LL Cool J?""
Yeah whassup? ""Can you please bust a funky rhyme for me?""
Yeah I can do that, check this one out honey
I motivate, accelerate
Devestate, and dominate
I don't smoke crack so I won't lose weight
Give me the {pussy} and the money and the mic and I'm straight
Go to a restaurant, give me steak
Then cook my chicken with Shake'n'Bake
I leave all the preachin to Reverand Flake
How much money can one black man make? Huh
I'm what's known as a true dynamiter
I write rhymes fast without a typewriter
Go with the flow, but no, I'm not a biter
Can't compare a cock-a-roach and a spider
Hell, you might as well get a glass of punch
'Cause you're bitin my lyrics like a Nestle Crunch, huh
And bitin my rhymes ain't slick
I got your gold teeth marks all over my [phone rings]
Complications and aggravation
An unnecessary-sation
I'm like Sunkist, good vibrations
Your al-blum, sounds like a compilation
Cool out, grab a seat and listen...
'Cause I'ma start dismissin
Sucker MC's who's out there frontin
Talkin' all that yang, yo you smokin' somethin'
Shoulda treated me royal, yo he wasn't loyal
Now it's all about chaos and turmoil
... Gimme that microphone
I'ma show you the real meaning of the danger zone
(Phone rings)
Yo... ""Hello is this 1-900-LL Cool J?""
Yeah whassup? ""Can you tell me what you do when you're coolin out?""
Yo check this out
Now when I'm coolin out, no time for a granny
Just a fly girl in t-shirt and panties
""Can LL {*censored*}?"" Man, can he?
I tell you what, give up the fanny
Cause on a bedroom tomb, J swift
Not too big, but nothin' to play with
In addition, you on a mission
You need to audition for another position
Doin' damage is a crew tradition
Name your next al-blum intermission
You're full of preservatives -- plus,
You're too conservative
I'm full of flair, savoir faire, debonairre
There's no competition, for this here
So don't waste your time and breath
I'm givin' you all a big F
MC's I envelop...
... As the song goes on, the rhyme develops
I'm asiatic, acrobatic, charismatic
You don't want no static
Anyway, I ain't havin' it!
When I see the microphone -- I'm grabbin it
Plug it in and take charge
LL XL, Xtra-Large
KnowhatI'msayin? Peace
(Phone rings three times)
Hello?
Hello whassup girl?
How you doin' girl? I been tryin' to call you all day
Word up I was talkin' to LL he was kickin some mo' HYPED up rhymes to me
Word, I spoke to him today too - them rhymes WAS pumpin
Well not to cut you short but I gotta go cause my man is here
All right
See-ya"
5,10 Million Stars,2002,10 (2002),,LL Cool J,"You can call it a comeback
I lay back analyse the vibes and realize to own that crown for lyrical combat
Spit raw raps to count more stacks
Kicking back in the coop I got loots relax
I'm hotness monotonous fans is running bizack
L please don't leave the game like thizat
Never in a million years, hell I never let you down baby
I drop 50 I'm still gravy
(Chorus repeat)
And I look back on Venus I look, I look back on Mars
And, and I burn in the fire of ten, of ten million stars
(Guess who's back)
I'm more than a conqueror double up your bets
Come and rumble with the bets I know you had that clown picked
Mind blowing now 'cause L still sound sick
You dreamed he was me I gleam lyrically
I love 'em for it's the highest form of flattery
Doing the buck ten chrome skating on the battery
My clutch burning on top of the world turning
Rookies is just learning 'bout stacks I been earning
I'm the uncle L teacher of the funk
Turn my joint up find out why I'm different from all these chumps
And tell your favourite rapper that I'm ready to thump
For real cat that represented rap from the jump.
(Chorus repeat)
Six figure inches on the cheddar for music, fashion, film or tele
Vision popping amaretto so what you got a vendetta
I never felt better now and forever competition gets severed by skills
You can't measure I'm a champ you a peon I kiss the ring be
Gone known and respected on every block you be on
And be on stand there get yo md on I chuckle 'cause it's
Noting to waist energy on there you have it
The uncut raw for rap addicts waited three years to see if L still had it
Ten million stars got beef to the jet ended my contract I'm the last on
Left
(Bridge repeat)
L's worth paper past def jam who put em' up in that sky paper
There's my dogs up in'05 who made a major LL player
Now who's next to need a favor drop a bomb on 'em
And I look back on Venus, I look,(I look back on Venus) I look back on mars
(I look back on mars and I burn with the fire of ten million stars)"
6,"4, 3, 2, 1",1997,Phenomenon (1997),,LL Cool J,"Make it butter
I'm gonna Bankhead bounce
No doubt
Aiyyo watch your mouth
Aiyyo, one two three four five six seven, blaze the hot
Trizack that sound like heaven
Seven six five four three two one
C'mon, Meth-Tical, come and get some
Playing my position, hot Nick, son
This one, for all the sick ones, infliction
Poisonous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itchin' with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D, no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sunning you
Got you shittin' in your last Huggie, running who
Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make yo meat lump, respect Wu
Aiyo I put it on a nigga, shitted on a nigga
Turn a Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin'
Shit I'm driving in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the gypsy
When I approach rappers be taking notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin' til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic
I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?""
I think I'll go on for more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like it had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild?
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?
I take em on in all shapes, sizes, and forms, and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred when I'm blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it
Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you, dog, believe that
Where we at, do you value your life, as much as your possessions
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on
You ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on Front Street, you think I'm sweet
Want heat, one deep, leave him behind, front seat
Aiyyo, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Blaze the hot trizack, shine like heaven
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Come on Mr. Smith, come get some
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords, I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like picking up a ball, playing with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to a fight
Snapping, you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team touring overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringing a tiger cub to his knees
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line
LL Cool J nigga, greatest of all time"

Here we go - another funky style
Peace to my brothers on ""Rikers' Isle""
Introducin' the crew, that's goin' a mile
To get behind the ropes, stop actin' wild
This here part is like section one
So you can bug-a-loo and set fire to your buns
Early mornin' light is yet to come
And when it come, we'll get buggy in the sun
Females - let your hair down
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown
With the funky sound, the razzamatazz
You give me to the ""sploshers"", you can get your-a blast
Enter at your own risk - some brothers got weapons
Yet you're still steppin', the beats' so funkafied
And answer to the bone, people'll be dancin' alone
Leanin' on the wall next to grandma's mop
With the funky, funky groove that's far from pop
Dosey-do your partner all night long
And all you mothers, bring your kids along
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) yeah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) Huh, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) yeah, hah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) (just kick a little somethin'...)
(LL Cool J)
Ain't no mountain high enough to overcome this
Funky-like type of stuff
The feds are ridiculous, they call my bluff
Oh, my wrists are too skinny to hold me with cuffs
I got the sure-shot guaranteed mover
Suck it like a hoover and do ya whole maneuver
Don't stop till you get it on
With ya head be- boppin' like a bouncy ball
They do it in the park, they do it in the mall
But when I do it (yeah), I'm doin' it for y'all
Asiatic, automatic, your funky fanatic without no static
Flippin' on the freak like I'm acrobatic
You were searchin' for the funk and I had it
Here we go - hand over the cash yo
What chime? Aiyyo, blast the tobasco
Work your body like a dime, oh no
Do the freaky-deaky - the whole girls' cargo
Females on the side - we gotta win 'em, yeah
The back pockets are stuck with nothin' in 'em, yeah
Except my beeper number, rubbin' all my lumber so I cannot slumber
Makes me sick like an earthquake
So do the baddy-too-true, we got cash to make
Able body, ready to party, all the ladies in the house
Must be eatin' hardy
And provin' and movin', groovin', so soothin' good for ya
And clinically proven - damn!
Every little bit of the tip makes ya taste flip, like sugar on Ritz
Get on down, to the sure-shot sound
Cause all five burrows are rockin' uptown
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) yeah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) whattup, hah, I do a little somethin'

(Yo Uncle) yeah, hah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) aiyyo, aiyyo (just kick a little somethin'...)
(LL Cool J)
Pump up the nasty, nasty, nasty sound
Kick back and let it please ya like a rub down
Put ya body in the lost and found
(Kick that L) I love the way its goin' down
What you see is what you get
And all the words who's next to be the teachers pet?
Down-home monkey - corn fed, original
And what you do is up to you, the individual
This is the place to be for y'all underage brothers
With the rebel mentality
Sweet young freaks sayin' ""Rock me ?Arma-day-us?
Skin so smooth lookin' all (???)
Video to video, tape to tape
Walkin' through the jam in search of a playmate
Party is packed like a rich man's fridge
Too many people in the crib
The situation is sweaty and crazy like Eddy
And yes we are ready to funk it up steady
Ain't nothin' here petty
Trip down to your laund-a-ray - I'm ready!
Hold your horse, and baby feel the force
And get jaws off - no matter what the cost
Come out to cloth, get hot like a stove
Early in the mornin', we're dancin' in robes
To a funkafied sweaty, greazy groove
I know the Marley remix to make you move
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) yeah, I do a little somethin'
(Yo Uncle) whassup, whassup?
(Yo Uncle) I do a little somethin'

9,After School,2002,10 (2002),,LL Cool J,"LL Cool J
I know a honey named Milly, raised out in Philly
Her body so illy she make a grown man silly
Her brainiac really but she pretend she dilly,
Like 'why you always look at me like that, you feel me?'
P. Diddy
There's a girl named Wendy, loves black business
Nails in her mouth stay trying to tempt me
She rolls with her sister and they both real friendly
It wasn't like that when my pockets was empty
LL Cool J
Shorty named Susie, not quite a foosey
Let's just say she has a problem being choosey
Scarf on her doobie when she in the jucuzzi
On the celly with her man 'luv you I'm at the movies
P. Diddy
There's this bird named Chyna,(LL) baby where'd you find her?
Uptown, she wrote a map down where I can find her
Hotness, with two or three girlfriends behind her
(LL) Or Amsterdam, Late in the lane, dippin the spot
LL and P. Diddy
After school I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I gotta color TV, so I can see, the Knicks play basketball
You wanna talk about check books, credit cards
I got more money, than a sucka could eva spend
And I couldn't give a fuck about cash you whip
Get your friends baby jump in the Benz
P. Diddy
I got a judge named Donna, I call her your honor
Wiling' out with the gavel and the silk pajamas
LL Cool J
And then there's Tarika, the size of BIG's beeper
Turned the Bass way up and whined on the speakers
Girl named Nelly, Rhine stone in her belly
Curly red hair crackin' jokes at the telly
Can't conceal the female my key in the deli
Hopin and praying that I ain't ready for the jelly
Both
What about Asian, major flava
Can you feel it? nothin' can save ya
Once again I got 'em catching the vapors
Mr. Smith about to get this paper
Paparazzi please give me a minute
Your pushing me to the limit, I know that I'm represented
Be easy
Diddy
Tammy, down in Miami, fo sheezy baby, I see you at the Grammy's
LL Cool Jand Diddy
I wanna rock rite now, LL and Diddy, we came to get down
Yes we internationally know, we make movies and the microphone
We get crazy, I mean outrageous
You rollin' with us, you rollin' with flava
Ask penny, I call them girl twenty
Cause after the show they ain't nothing open but Denny's
Maybe the waffle house down sout, there's many
She fix me a T-Bone and take it to the Bentley
Little Shaniqua from Massapequa,
Went and bought a beeper so I could reach her
Anyways, when you talk about Diddy and L
Yu talk about careers that's hard to kill
The whole entire globe recognize the grill
Walking down the red carpet wearing chilly chill
I wanna rock rite now, LL and Diddy, we came to get down
Yes we internationally know, we make movies and the microphone
We get crazy, I mean outrageous
You rollin' with us, you rollin' with flava"
10,"Ahh, Let's Get Ill",1987,Bigger And Deffer (1987),,LL Cool J,"I'm the Ladies Love, legend in leather
Long and lean, and I don't wear pleather
Last of the red hot lovin' MC's
Lookin' for a little, that's my theory
It goes quick like lightning, too exciting
Lover of ladies, don't allow biting
Level-headed leader, toy boy feeder
Good love life and a rhyme biter beater
Looking, learning, the one you're liking
Listen and you will love what I'm writing
Ladies love, long, hard and lean
And now you know what L.L. means
[ Girls ] Ah!

Lightning in the sky, L.L. don't lie
I can hold a larger load than those other little guys
My literature is the land's highest law
The man of the brand, one you look out for
I'm loose like the lace in your brand new sneaker
Release the bass in your face like a large Vega speaker
Li-li-lis-listen to my rhyme
Here to satisfy the listeners who stood on line
Bought tickets to see me kick it and wasn't late
The love every little bit of the cuts he creates
First not last, leader of the class, see
From London, Long Beach, and down to Tallahassee
Ladies are pleased, I'm not wearin Lee's
The Kangol is mine, the godfather is E
I bust your lip, my level won't slip
Clockin crazy dollars on the L.L. tip

Loose with the ladies, loud like a ref
When I die, there will be no lovers left
I'm the little girl liker, legendary writer
Let's see, I never lost 'cause I burn like a lighter
My love is long and my lyrics rock loud
Lurkin shadow in the shadows like Little McLoud
I'm the Ladies Love, lyrical lord in the club
Ladies Love, the man you dream of

Never ever lost, not lonely or alone
You can call me the last Capone
Not a little kid playing with garbage can lids
Don't need a legal lawyer, I ain't doin' no bid
Cause the ladies know my bass is low
Rockin' L after L ever since the intro
Liberacce couldn't rock it like the long-legged pro
Two legs, not four like Lassie, I don't eat Alpo
Come on

All over the land they listen to my jams
Like a cherry lollypop when you're lickin' your hand
I'm poppin' and lockin, so I can give you a list
All of my lyrics are swift, so the losers never riff
I love givin' 'em bliss, havin' my name on the list
I'm the life of the party and my rhymes are priceless
Each jam is like a lesson other rappers must learn
Cold laugh 'cause they don't like it every time I return
Come on
[ Girls ] Ah!
[ Guys ] Let's get ill!
Come on now

Newcomers, step on back and if you hid last summer
Catch a heart-attack, 'cause I'm back
I'm bad, you write rhymes made are blad
I'm mad 'cause they said I wasn't bad
No recognition 'cause they said I'm from the ghetto
Carryin' nine millimeters and stiletto's
I guess I need a TV show to get mine
But I don't feel like kissin' no director's behind
That's too soft for L
I'ma write a rhyme-fighter inside of the rebel ""Yell""
Hour jack loops and dancer troops
Watch out for the gangsta-machine-gun-loose

Last year pop rappers got awards
And don't know a damn thing about a block party mic-cord
They see LL, they know the brothers' real
But the flies can tell you exactly how they feel
When I come in the door it's like I'm made of dynamite
I gotta blow up more and more
Shakin' the rafters from here on after
Puttin' an end to all the laughter
There ain't no way they can win
With the band all in, plus the turntable spin
Strip-searchin' competition, you can call 'em competition
But there ain't no competition 'cause I'm on a mission
I'ma rip this game, I want the soul train families and anybody with a name
Superstars step aside this year
And all you other little crumbs that wanna try and come near
I'm sick and tired of political setbacks
Too much red tape-the-box, so forget that

I started in the basement of my grandmother's house
My rap got gashed, your whole body's' gettin' doubts
Burnt to a crisp, lead from the mist
Third degree and Gods' my only witness
When I shocked the world, hold the prince hostage
For the diamonds and pearls
Maker-Mike will remember the time
Tellin' Madonna black love ain't a crime
I'm like a shogun, I ain't scared of no one
Born and raised in New York, that's where I come from

I love the way the bass sound, when I'm underground
Boulevard to boulevard, avenue to avenue, I'll be havin' you

Your whole car rockin' like a war machine
Neighbors downstairs call current-affairs
Cause the party got ripped and yours truly was there

When I'm ridin' on the street I hear gunshots [rare shots]
(Swear) crack niggas 'cause they moms missed flips
So black man really care about politics
In the ninety's, our governments so slick
I watch CNN sometimes and I realize
They're playin' tricks on my mind
They want a man to work with his hands
Too young to die, and they don't give a damn
Rare-momma got down on her knees
But not no more, god damn it, I make cheese
I'm on the move and I'ma show and prove

And then makes sure that they come around the way
Gain the points until the whole race traps

Say the clubs, I can't get a job
Mouth to feed, somebody's gettin' robbed
I ain't worked, but I ain't workin' for crumbs
You ever seen a man-shelter?
Check out the bombs!
Brother of pain, their whole lives are over
They spent every dime tryin' not to be sober
And all the ladies got bags of clothes
They'll be your long lost momma, one never knows

When you need a toga-black, hire black linen
Your rippers' man applause when he can't get a job
He gets up all of his family and feels like a slob
The black women don't understand
'Cause they don't realize what it is to be a black man
In the mornin', a brother feels like a jerk
Seein' black women and white men go to work
So all women fear, the brothers ain't real
'Cause they won't give us no jobs, that's the real deal
Hold my hand while I get it all together
They don't deserve me at times of bad weather
'Cause I'ma make it out the concrete walls
And there's another way besides basketball
Let me go, let me do what I do

And you can get robbed if you wanna

You're seein' gold teeth, ya hearin' funky beats
Brothers ride by real slow
You get leary when they got tinted windows
Sittin' on the steps with a blunt
I'm drinkin' Valentine, I wasn't raised up front
My Aunt Ellie always talked about God
Tell me you never cried 'cause it's so hard
Government got a hell of a plan
But word is born they ain't destroyin' this black man

I copped you more than what you bargained for
Roll the red carpet, enjoy the profits

Daddy just made a nine digit deposit
Believe me sweetie, it's not luck it's logic
I'm the captain of my destiny
Used to dream of the things I was blessed to see
The jewels and the papers, sports cars and such
There's nothing in the world LL can't touch
You stood by my side and pushed me so much
That's why you got them 10 karats, you know what?

(LL Cool J)
Uh, uh, slide out to Venice, my game's in order
Would chip in to vent, but the city's on water
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky
A vowel on the end of everything we buy
Yellow ice in both ears, I loosen up the tie
I'm lovin' this lifestyle, baby I can't lie
It feels so good it make a grown man cry
'Cause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died
I guess I had determination
And baby girl kept me in the congregation
Now it's private jets and deep conversation
Hundred G's a month to show appreciation
All eyes on us, the cameras flash
In God We Trust, I don't love this cash
But you was definitely - by my side when my world collapsed
Now I'm, rich for life and I'm payin' you back
{*Amerie ad libs*}
(LL Cool J - over Chorus)
This is like this for life baby
This gon' always be like this
God is my witness
Hold you tight for the rest of my life
Yknahmsayin?
There's nothing I won't do for you baby
I'm your man, I'm your man
Our love is amazing, yeah
[Amerie] It's so, amazing, to me"
15,American Girl,2008,Exit 13 (2008),,LL Cool J,"March, march, march, march
Boomdizzle, baby
Way back in 1776
Who would have thought we would have had these chicks
Sum kinda slim and some extra thick
They make me feel so patriotic
Man, American girls are something to see
I bet Thomas Jefferson would love B E T
This is a celebration all across the land
Light the fireworks, bring out the marching band
Uncle L, I love the heart land
South Carolina, they lookin' so tan
Out in Kansas, they so outlandish
Up in Nebraska, I know whatcha after
Bubble baths and Budweiser, joy and laughter
A good ol' boy that's not tryin' to gas ya
American girl, no doubt who the best are
I get harder, faster than a car in Nascar
Make more reveal, I wanna ride again
The red coats are comin', fuck it, let 'em in
The king of England woulda left us alone
If he saw Jessica Simpson eat an ice cream cone
Teeny bikinis, red, white and blue
American girl, I salute you
From Massachusetts to Albuquerque
Back to the Mid West, as sweet as the dessert be
I see you out there dancing
Looks like you need romancing
You're my American girl, American girl
You know I wanna hold you
Here's something you can roll to
You're my American girl, American girl

I'm so glad that French helped us out
Now you're free to walk around and let your cleavage bounce
The Founding Fathers would've been hot and bothered
Watching boomdizzle, you know what I'm talking about
From Philadelphia to Illinois, St. Louis, Alabama
Country Gramma
Queens, New York, Detroit to Montana
Today's your day girl, let's raise the banner
Benjamin Franklin, I so wanna thank him
Take a look at these girls, they the best in the world
Blonds and brunettes, redheads with curls
March with me girl and let your baton twirl
Champagne corks were bursting in the air
Gave prove through the night, my girls were still there
I'm a drum major, leading you to the flavor
Go ahead and shake whatcha mama gave ya
Oh, oh, say can you see
By the dawns early light
Party with me every night
Let down your hands, alright
Whatever you do, don't lose this all fast
I'ma have to fly my flag at half mass
You go girl, you make me wanna holler
Take George off and put your boobs on the dollar
I see you out there dancing
Looks like you need romancing

Put your hand in the air, bring the liberty bell
I give you the John Hancock if you don't tell
Let's have the Boston Tea party, what the hell
Celebrate the day Crispus Attucks fell
So we could use our parts and rock to LL
36 double D's never troubled me
Thank god that Columbus made that discovery
The queen of Spain, spends some change
Now Paris Hilton is pushing the range
Stars ride by while the chauffeur's drive
But all you girls with 9 to 5's dance with pride
This is the USA, great to be alive
Great watch the videos with them big ol' thighs
Brown and blue-green and hazel eyes
All directed straight towards the prize
Any shape or size, all different types survive
Around the way girls, ready to ride
Farmers daughter on the John Deer with pride
Conservative blue bloods, intelligent minds
With them girls next door, they put me under a spell
I'm on top of the world, I'ma screaming to tell
I love the USA girls
Almost as much as The Giants beat Green Bay, girl
I see you out there dancing
Looks like you need romancing
You're my American girl, American girl
You know I wanna hold you

I'm the king.
I floss rings, the new John Mickens
Uh, I'm stayin' rich and keep the haters bitchin
From New York to Richmond, my shine is sickenin
Ice drips, frost bits, or forfeit shit
I got to rewrite this mackin' game, baby
Layin' in the barber shop, knowin' haters is shady
Maybe, they sex young chicks and whips
But I got lesbo combos ridin' stick-shifts
For no chips, I'm seein' 4 to 8 lips
Let me tell ya 'bout my life-style, playas and chips, sick
Mr. Smith, the rarest breed
Separate the dimes from 'hoes like chronic seeds
Miraculous
Lyrical swiftness
Practice this, stop bein' actresses
On mattresses with your legs up in the air
Splash the crisp... John Micks, a millionaire
Anutha Day ... anutha Dolla
My fortune 500 is fully funded
Joints I pumps, gives my pockets the mumps
I'm the glossiest and the costliest
Feel the force of this
Lyrical arsenist
Hotter ... than a yacht with rottweillers
Chicks in choppers with they thong sittin' proper
The crisp poppa bringin' drama like soap operas
The show stopper if you playas don't flow proper
I'm the jiggiest, bitch, shit the wittiest
Wonderin' why cats front on who's the williest
Chill, relax, you cats will fall
10 mill, 10 plaques upon my wall
You stall, mix large, I see y'all
Mash ya like roaches then cop diamond broaches
Supercalla - nevermind the alladocious
Sin the fellas, get blazed and you can quote this
Anutha day ... anutha dolla
I'm the MC that you strive to be
Competition is dead, 'cause ain't none of y'all live as me
Handsome moody, I keep it raw, baby
So save all the goodfella shit for Scorsece
So iced up, they call me Mount Everest
The many get honey ways draped over my headrest
I run game from Fort Green to Maine
I keep ya head noddin' like dope is in your vein
Hail to the King Cajone ... jing-a-ling
I buy ya clicks loyalty with one pinkie ring
Gotta be above average to grow cabbage
I wreack havoc, do damage
Don't have it
Uh huh ... techniques up to par
Yeah you, get ya black ass looped like Mardi Gras
Chick soup too
Hittin' me off in yo' car
Blaze her in the alley 'cause she actin' bourgeoise
Anutha day ... anutha dolla
Ah man ... it's hard bein' the King, baby
But someone's gotta do it, haha"

That joint is hot baby
Lights, Camera, Action hold up
You know my style I been blowed up
Paper was young now it is growed up
Stack so big it's hard to fold up
Yo D find another rubber band in the truck
Count up the money I'ma stand in the cut
Stroll in the party I toast 'cris up
Tell Vladmir hook the guest list up
Shake that cookie like what like what
Toss me rapper like lightning struck
Look at that apple cobbler butt
What you wanna do
What you think won't cut
NBA Live in my truck
Parking lot like all jammed up
If there's beef it's best you duck
I'm gonna eat it I'm fulled up
Give it to me
That Apple Cobbler
Better yet
Can I see
That Apple Pie
Give it to me
That apple cobbler
Better yet
Can I get
Can I get it deep fried
So much sugar is making my head rush
Tell me what the recipe is for that stuff
Break me off a piece of crust
I'm so full I'm bout to bust
Just one slice is not enough
Dang that thing tight like handcuffs
What I gotta say to you for you to give it up
What if I was paying you so could live it up
Gucci seats inside your truck
Tiffany rocks and trillion cuts
You be Starsky I be Hutch
Ride shotgun I'll pop that clutch
Juicy sweatpants driving me nuts
Take my two way stay in touch
I'm gonna scoop you heat you up
Take you bake you eat you up
Give it to me
That Apple Cobbler
Better yet
Can I see
That Apple Pie
Give it to me
That apple cobbler
Better yet

Turn that hair round buck them hips
Love when ya hair gets stuck to ya lips
Apple cobbler sweet and thick
I'm gonna eat you till I'm sick
Yo desert is worth a grip

Make me wanna run to the mall like I'm a trick
Can't believe you're making a baller have a fit
Pimpin' switchin pass my click
Big fat juicy ask my click
Stretch them jeans girl make them fit

18,Around the Way Girl,1990,Mama Said Knock You Out (1990),,LL Cool J,"(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
(On your loving)
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)
Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you, then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangsta talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for lovin'
You're real independent so your parents be buggin'
But if you ever need a place to stay,
(Ooh you love me) come around my way
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
To the bridge
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With that New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way, you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watchin' all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawkin' you
Baby-hair pumping, lip gloss is shinin'
I think you in the mood for winin' and dinin'
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renée, I love you (smooch)
You're from around the way
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl
That's the one for me
She don't love him
(You got me shook)
I need an around-the-way girl, an around-the-way girl
Fine as can be
(Ooh you love me)
She oh, yeah
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me (the only one for me)
I need an around-the-way girl (an around-the-way girl)

Radio killer
Yeah,
Y'all think they can handle this one man
All right
Call the radio and tell 'em this your song (this your song, this your song, this your song, this your song)
Girl come on (girl come on, girl come on,)
'Cause I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby
Met this little girl, she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin' with my head, wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you movin' vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My pulp ain't fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo, she ride mandingo
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single
She makes me tingle
Shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby
She likes Hip-Hop and R&B
Her life time goal is to be on TV
She looking for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
'Cause wit whipped cream on em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beer, inside of daddy's '64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress 'n' she let me peep that
I'm Drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Bought her some dessert, give a damn if its early
Head spinnin' around like roller derby
Everything about her says you don't deserve me
I hope I'm worthy
'Cause shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby
I'm your baby, your baby
('Cause I'm your baby)
You need somethin' like me? (Good luck)
'Cause he ain't nothin' like me (no)
You can search but you never gone find
A love that's quite like mine (no)
Need a man that can love you good
And treat you like he should
With me shawty you the shit
He might be good but he ain't like this
'Cause I'm your baby
In the back of the pickup, clothes the rip up
She see my chrome wheels, it gets more real
Running and laughing, music blasting
Side over the road, bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, can feel the urge
If you see my mama, don't say a word
The cops wanna know I'm a word are slurred
Don't ask me officer ask her
Wanna another drink baby she like sure
Wanna hit the club she like I don't curr
She all in the rearview doin' her hurr
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhurr
This all happens on an average day
Your life is a trip girl, I'm here to stay
Never had a girl make me feel this way
Even tho I had to pay
'Cause shawty I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby
I'm your baby, your baby, your baby, your baby

Still in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while
So I pull up to your door to give you what you're looking for

You're checkin' out my carphone, scopin' out my jewelry

You got class but deep down you're real freakish
You got it all, but you never had a wild episode
That's when me and my jeep showed
Up with the funk in the trunk and
Hittin' it, we're spunkin'
I'll even get you drunk and tipsy
'Cause I know you're feelin' frisky
You love it 'cause it's wild and risky
You got your eyes on the hood
You're up to no good
I took you in the back, you hoped I would
You got your black on black so stacked in the back
While I'm pumpin' in the CD I'll skip a track
Windows are foggy
And, uh, back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby
And you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets
I give it to you real raw in the backseat
That's how you want it, don't ya? (yeah)
You'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? (nah)
Don't lie
Take it in your eye (why?)
So buckle up, buckle up
What's my name? what's my name? what's my name? what's my name? huh
I never knew a four wheel drive could be so live
I'll put your numbers in the archives
So take 'em off, and put them things on the mirror girl
It's my jeep and your world
You got it going on lovely, time to do the right thing
'Cause I can tell you wanna swing
We're bonin' on the dark blocks
Wearin' out the shocks, wettin' up the dashboard clock
Seats full of sweat, I told ya I would hit it
Your kitty, kitty, cat, cat, was hungry so I fed it
Workin' as a team
Somebody, anybody [scream]
Jump with me to the cash bar
I'll be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin' ""waah""
Damn, it's so good, the mad grip on my tip
You're still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip
You go wild and stick your toes on the roof (yeah yeah)
You're so cute, wit' your gold tooth
Exstentions on the carpet
That nice round brown is my target
It's so firm, so cushy, it makes me feel mushy
I love it when it's pushy
But don't laugh, I'm serious with this (word up)
The back seat of my jeep, is priceless
You're climaxin', you're climaxin', it's full action
You love a good waxin', it's so relaxin'

That's close to when the beat drops to the rewind point, locate point
You ain't gotta be on that all night, this the soundtrack
Yo, Yeah, Check it
Ok, all right, huh ok
The other night I was up at Farmers, politician wit some bloods
They told me ""yo L, in the streets you ain't gettin' no Love
And Ever since the X's and the Jiggas came out
My niggas ain't tryin' to the hear that smooth shit you talk about
What's Up wit that cat Canibus, some played you out
Why you didn't answer back correctly, fuck was that about?""
As I sip on some henny, and try to explain some things
About the life of a legend, and all the Drama it brings
Been gone a long time, had a lot of shit on my mind
I decided I don't want to reach my goal if it means losing my shine
Streets is Hip-hop and I'm Hip-Hop, so the streets is Mine
Ballin' as long as you been livin', that's a long time
Hard to Stay hungry when your pockets are so fat
You hit a hot one in every city on the map
And niggas keep sleepin' and you keep coming back
You know better than the gat, but niggas still wanna clap
(Chorus 2x - Ja Rule)
It feels so good to be back Where I Belong
The Streets is Where I Belong
They Had me locked down much too long
Hey Hey
Some Say ""L that's cool, but see times have changed""
Niggas got red bandanas, and the grill in the range
That gold shit is dead, niggas rock platinum chains
Trade O.E. for Henny, Colt 45 for champagne
Hustling niggas found they way into the game
Extorting all these so called ballers wit big names
And you gotta have a squad, 'cause running from Def ain't safe
I know you living good, but ain't no smile up on our face
I'm like a villain, I'm representing on my lyrics
And force feed the world, even if they don't want to hear it
As far as Canibus go, my man is hittin' his ex-broad
I'm getting head from his new piece
While 20 gang-bangers applaud, you came up with that bullshit
Some heads sucked it up, then you dropped that garbage album
And Totally fucked it up, I coulda told ya I knew your moms
From the after-hours spot, when I used to be up in Canada
With the dreads on a black block, before you dick rode Lost Boyz
For a ticket our to Jersey, but being the man I am
I tried to show ya mercy, I coulda told the World
The way ya label hates your guts
And how me and Wyclef, got together to set you up
And how he gave me half your budget, don't believe me look it up
Ya A&R promotion niggas, they helped me hook it up
I hate to be responsible, for destroying your career
A one-hit wonder, huh
No Wonder you disappeared, I coulda told the world
You get your lyrics from the internet
Then spit 'em word for word
Like you really a rap vet, How you take metaphors from books
And put 'em in your rhyme, and how you really from Canada
And you been frontin' all this time
I heard your second album, that shit is garbage too
LL Cool J and I did this to you
On that note he said
""Yo L, you the man"", I said peace, one love
And Drove off in the Lex Land
(LL Cool J talking)
Yeah nigga, the jig is up nigga, huh ha
You know what I'm sayin'?, all that bullshit you was talking
Don't mean shit, you finish now
I'm still the man nigga
The vanguard award is in my motherfuckin living room
You know what I mean? come get that shit, fuck, what
MIC still on my arm nigga, word up
Both arms, I'ma get another one nigga
You Know what I'm sayin', this LL you know how I get down
You should of known, when you did it
He probably did it to get some fame
But is this really what you want? Hahahahahahahha"

Bring another hundred bottles a day
Bartender please
Feel me... Feel me
Like fo real though
All this fraudulent shinin
And imitation diamonds is damn near blinding
Every time leave the country
I gotta come back foreign just to remind ya
Know they watchin my moves but they never figure out exactly how I'm grindin
I needs rock to my ears
They say the bands look at the finest
No captains, funny
Flashing this money like you taking something from me
Girl gave me the eye, this dude's a dummy
Don't play boy, I'll bag yo lil bunny
Chain around my neck made the night look sunny
Game so cold, your crew knows it's runny
L's in the building, you know that kid
'Cause 100 for yo nose, baby blow that quick
Forget yo swag (Forget yo swag)
Feel me... Feel me

Bartender please
Feel me... Feel me
Hold and grow, dipped in what
Get a grip then flip, grip the dick, Heathcliff
The giff, the gaff, the riff, the raff
I'm slick with the bit when I pin it to
I'm attracted swag or the crip Louie bags
La di da and my Adidas
Get out for shizzey, just say you never pissey
You'll never as cool as me, cool, chill back
Forget yo swag (Forget yo swag)
Feel me... Feel me
Got money, I don't care bout that
I don't care about that
Feel me... Feel me
Keep them ordinary chicks away
Get up out my face
Feel me... Feel me
Bring another hundred bottles a day
Bartender please
Feel me... Feel me
Yeah, this the same old script
LL Jordan, white riders on tip
Proving every rapper in the game can't spit
You gon turn around and get yo forehead split
Finish with the workout, I might blow the splif
Young girls talking bout - Hi, Mister Smith
Quick baby, put the Maserati in 5th
Brim on the 80 ave, lookin' all stiff
LL, boy where you been?
Without you in the game how the coach gon win?
Call Snoop Dogg, it's time to go in
Tell my man Bootsy bring the big mouths in
Step on the parkay, you know I'm gon win
It's tight balling, you can't defend
If money is stacked up, Cool's locked in
Y'all get the message, I ain't gotta press send
Forget yo swag (Forget yo swag)
Feel me... Feel me
Got money, I don't care bout that
I don't care about that

24,Bath Salt,2013,Authentic (2013),,LL Cool J,"I think this intro should be more dramatic
Ah man
It's LL season, let's ride!
Hands up, hands up
Hands up, slip into the bath salt
(Push it) never 'cause I have to
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard
(Push it) and I got the game mastered
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment
(Push it) we back to the basement
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
Push it real good
Uh, boss of all bosses
Face in the car, make a young girl noxious
Yeah, this beat salad when I toss this
Never go against me, you lack resources
What? I skywalk with the forces
Back in the 80's I was playin' in Porsches
Money ain't a problem, I toll my losses
Maserati coup, take galloping horses
Nah, there's never been one like me
They're looking for a new me as if there might be
Even with a love song, that's unlikely
If L ain't the dope, may lightning strike me
Uh, killin' Queens all day
I got what you want, what you willin' to pay?
Your boy ladies love sound, clean on the track
Slip into the bath salt, wash my back, come on
(Push it) never 'cause I have to
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard
(Push it) and I got the game mastered

(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
Push it real good
Honestly I was scared to come back
It was ugly not knowing how the game would react
Said my old gym teacher, he supposed to rap
But now I teach class, put back Tony
You see it in my eyes, transparent like glass
Giving all for my soul to have another smash
Yeah, LL Cool J
30 years later, be me for a day
Same day, just a daddy, she love me anyway
So I told er what to read and I showed er how to pray
Cats on my team, got NBA
But it's my black, from the web we stay
I don't whack my suicides, I act my age
Never try to sound like a rapper I raised
Roared as a tiger, can't grow no brains
But the money's coming in in 360 ways
(Push it) never 'cause I have to
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard
(Push it) and I got the game mastered
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment
(Push it) we back to the basement
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went

(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
Push it real good

Once we start it ain't no stoppin', girl
Get your best dress on tonight
This is for the girls
With all those ghetto curves
But we gon' get to poppin' now, girl
Get your best dress on tonight
54-11's poppin' wheelies front of Willyburgers
Candy apple M3's, slidin' out gently
Rollin' up in Bentleys, Tyson was the champ then
Right after the Rooftop, years before the Hamptons
You was a ghetto queen and a diamond in the rough
You was so beautiful and the world was so rough
Your man was locked up cause the cops popped up
You dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up
He was yo' crush, you was his crutch
He'll be gone a dime and it's hard to stay in touch
Your moms say you stupid but you love him so much
Now it's broken dreams and broken Beemers in the dust
Standin' up on a crowded bus, for college courses
Stay on course when it gets rough, you never lost it
Stay strong baby trust, you'll be back flossin'
Diamond studs and linen crush keep your head up
We gon' get it poppin' now girl

Her boyfriend's comin' through with them hickeys on his neck
He claims he's lovin' her but never shows her no respect
All she knows is neglect, a lifetime of stress
Big momma, huh momma, now lil' momma is next
You can see the effects of gettin' treated incorrect
'Cause she let the cycle continue, make excuses for his steps
Her girlfriends tried to warn her, all he wanted was the sex
Once he get it, then he gone, then it's on to somethin' fresh
Somethin' new, nuttin' borrowed, nuttin' blue, no weddin' dress
But that's a'ight, you still young, you got your lifetime left
You gotta leave all that alone, find yourself
There's no love until you love you remind yourself
We gon' get it poppin' now girl
Get your best dress on tonight
Once we start it ain't no stoppin' girl
Get your best dress on tonight
This is for the girls
With all those ghetto curves

Keep fightin', uh

Hands by your side, stop tryin' to touch me
Let me soak it in, breathe, you smellin lovely
Kiss yo belly button, and fill it with bubbly
Take a taste, let it drip down your waste
Have it all over my face, outer body experience like you're floating out of space
Come back down gently
Grind your hips on me, you set with the melody
And let the words that I say live on in your memory

Stuff all the things, pause, 'cause you're giving me your all
But I never had a lover make me feel this real
Hold it up in the room, all night, all day
All week I'm strung out like a freak
Got me tapping on my arm for a fix

Work you out to this beat, it's just you and me in the suite
My tongue is all on your feet, sheets covering me
I'm kissing all that I see, exactly how it should be

27,Big Mama (Unconditional Love),2002,10 (2002),,LL Cool J,"Yeah. this one is dedicated to my grandmother, and your grandmother.
It's all love, let's not forget who raised us. Word up.
Big momma, my grandmother, my main girl.
I love you much more than the scandelous world.
As a young boy you gave me whoopin's to save my life.
Cursed me out to keep me out the streets at night.
Cause my momma had me when she was young.
So you took on the responsibility to raise your grandson.
You taught me if a task is once begun tard,
Never leave it till it's done tard.
Be thy labug great all small tard.
Do it well or not at all god!
Big momma my blood is your blood,
When the whole world is against me I know I got your love.
If I was in a cell for the rest of my life,
I know I'd hear your prayers in the middle of the night.
You used to sit me on your lap and teach me mother whit,
Early Sunday mornin' for them salmon and grits.
I love you baby you the one and only and that's a fact.
Till death do us part I'ma always have your back.
You beefed cause heard that I was cursing in my raps,
86' still you wanna run and get the straps.
I love you I promise you I care for you deep,
'Cause when I had Bronchities you would rock me to sleep.
Rub me down with green alchahol,
Little brown skinned lady bout five feet tall big momma
Early one Sunday morning,
Breakfast was on the table.(You give me unconditional love)
There was no time to eat,
She said to me,"" boy hurry to Sunday school"" (You give me unconditional love)
I remember when you told me certain friends wasn't real,
I didn't want to listen I swore I knew the deal.
Come to find out everything you said was true,
Who I end up going to for advice? You.
I love you that's why you got nurses and maides,
Ever since I got paid you ain't never been afraid.
That's grandaddy wife she taught me how to think,
How to navigate through life you made the sacrifice.
You kept on living 'cause when my grandaddy died,
It took all your might but you ain't quit on life.
We took trips down south biscuits and chicken
Me, you grandad and Allison trippin'.
Remember you used to pick me up from Junior High,
And classmates laughed when the Buick rolled by.
Remember I pulled my privates out in class,
And from Farmers to Dunkirk you straight whooped my, Whoo!
The best cookin' a man could ever taste,
It's written in my heart it could never be erased.
Thank you so much you taught me well,
How to not get souped up because I'm LL.
How to walk the street and hold my head real high,
How to live with Christ and not be afraid to die.
We sipped Dacuries but you never told moms,
We even shared beers Big momma my dear.
A toast to a woman that raised a man,
Hit popular demand all across the land.
You're my lawyer, my teacher, my doctor, my friend,
My mother, my father, you with me till the end.
I love you I mean that from the bottom of my heart,
That's the reason why my record is number one on the chart.
I'ma tell you like it is I'll love you forever,
Dead or alive we'll always be together Big momma I love you.
I dedicate this to the Big mommas everywhere,
The ones who raised us when nobody else was there.
The ones who held us and told us we would be all right,
When gunshots was goin' off every night.
Told us how to lock the door and check the peep whole,
And how to swallow Vix when we had a chest cold.
How to stay proud represent hard,
Eat plenty baby but first say grace to god.
Big momma I'ma miss you when one of us leave this earth,
But baby for what it's worth I loved you from the date of my birth.
And if it wasn't for my children I would want to go first.
Your the reason I'm the man I am today,
The inspiration for me to be LL Cool J.
When you told me knock 'em out I brought you home a grammy,
I learned to be tough from big momma and Aunt Cammy.
A black man that was raised by black women,
On tour sippin your special honey and lemon.
You told me gargle with vinegar, water, and salt,
The concert was hot thanks to your support.
Girl your the one I love,
Whether right here with me or smiling from up above.
Trouble or no trouble you always had my back,
So I had to let you know your son appreciates that Big momma
(Chorus 2 times)
Music Fades Out..."
28,Big Ole Butt,1989,Walking With A Panther (1989),,LL Cool J,"I was at the mall, sippin' on a milkshake
Playin' the wall, takin' a break
Admirin' the girls with the bamboo earings
Baby hair and bodies built to swing
That's when I seen her
Her name was Tina
Grace and poise kinda like a ballerina
I said, ""How you doin', my name's Big L
Don't ask me how I'm livin', 'cause, yo, I'm living swell
But then again I'm livin' kind of foul
'Cause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl""
To make a long story short, I got the digits
Calls her on my car phone and paid her a visit
I was spankin' her and thankin' her, chewin' her and doin' her
Layin' like a king on sheets of satin
That's what time it is, you know what's happenin'
She had a big ole booty, I was doin' my duty
I mean, yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie
But Tina was erotic, Earl's my witness
With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business
When I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek
But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak
I sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in
And said to her with a devilish grin...
TINA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But TINA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
TINA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But TINA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
I went to the high school about three o'clock
To try to catch a cutie ridin' my jock
My homeboy's jeep, the system blastin'
Cold forty dogs, smilin' and laughin'
Girls all over, the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
That's when I seen her
Her name was Brenda
She had the kind of booty that I'd always remember
I said to my man, ""Stop the jeep""
She's only senteen but, yo, don't sleep
I kicked the bass like an NFL punter
And scoped the booty like a big game hunter
I said to the girl, ""Yo, you look tired
Let's go get some rest, relax by the fire""
I put the big booty on a bearskin rug
She gave me a kiss, I have her a hug
I said to the girl, ""them young boys ain't nothin'
You want to get freaky, let me kiss your belly button""
I circled it and teased it and made her squeal
Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
When I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes
When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
Tina busted in my house while I was eatin'
You know what I said
Too bad you caught me cheatin', but...
BRENDA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But BRENDA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
BRENDA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But BRENDA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak
Around the time whe the waitress are on their lunch break
I pulled in the parkin' lot and parded my car
Somebody shouted out, ""I don't care who you are""
I paid it no attention, I walked inside
Because Brian had a nine and he was chillin' in the ride
I walked in the place, everybody was lookin'
And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cookin'
I sat down to eat, ordered my food
I said to the waitress, ""I don't men to be rude
But I'll take you on a platter""
She said, ""You got a girl,"" I said, ""It don't matter
You look like you're tastier than a pipin' hot pizza
What's your name?"" She said, ""My tag says Lisa""
I said, ""O.K., you're smart and all that
But when you get off work, yo, I'll be back""
She looked at me and said, ""Make yourself clear
L, where we going?"" I said, ""Right here""
She looked kind of puzzled, I said, ""You'll see""
I pulled up at ten on the D.O.T.
When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
Laid her on the table and place my order
And habe her a tip much bigger than a quarter
On and on to the break 'a dawn
All over the restaurant, word is born
I heard somebody coughin', I checked my watch
I couldn't believe it said nine o'clock
I grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol
Who did I see, Oh, yo, it was Brenda
Yo, she worked at Red Lobster but I didn't remember
LISA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But LISA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
See ya
LISA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But LISA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
See ya"
29,Born to Love You,2002,10 (2002),,LL Cool J,"James Todd Smith, knowhatI'msayin? Trackmasters
Fresh off the private jet from Europe - did four months out there
Extra paper, scoop that up
Back on the scene, crisp and clean
You know how we get down baby, let me tell you a lil' story
(LL Cool J)
You're not a chickenhead goin' ""hee-shey""
You're choosy in the bed like ""hee-shey""
I know your man's in the feds but ""hee-shey""
I can't figure out the reason you keep hawkin me
Is it the... invisible settings on the baguettes?
The Benzes, Beamers and Corvettes?
Or the... wood-grain in the convertible Lex
Be ease, shoppin' sprees, what designer is next?
Is it the... Diablo, parked on Rodeo?
Half a mill' in the trunk and I ain't moved no llello
Could it be I'm... anti-pimp, hundred-thousand a clip
Hat low, doin' donuts when I pull up out the dealership
Is it the... the Fortune 500 covers?
The family man that got one baby mother?
The way I brainwash y'all to love one another
And got the whole community bouncin' in unity
(Chorus 2X: LL Cool J + (girl))
(Born to love you baby) Why?
(You know I love you baby) Why?
(Kiss and hug you baby) Why?
(I'll always love you baby) Why?
(LL Cool J)
Hmm... you're not a chickenhead goin' ""hee-shey""
You're choosy in the bed like ""hee-shey""
I know your man's in the feds but ""hee-shey""
I can't figure out the reason you be hawkin me
Is it the... twenty million I be grabbin a flick?
Or my four-hundred million dollar FUBU clique?
Is it the... ""In the House"" syndication chips
Poppin' two bottles, shorty read my lips
They say Ladies, Love, Legend in Leather
Simple ain't it... uh, but quite clever
Is it the... fact I melt in liquid ice?
Tapped it once, you felt it twice
Is it the... multiple O's I'm known for those
Temptation Island, wildin cause my neck froze
Is it the... bowlegged, hard-headed
Little honey in my grill with her pinkies wetted?
Forget it
(Chorus w/ variations)
(LL Cool J)
Mmm... you're not a chickenhead goin' ""hee-shey""
You're choosy in the bed like ""hee-shey""
I know your man's in the feds but ""hee-shey""
I can't figure out the reason you keep hawkin me
Is it the... way I caress and hold you close?
The iller, villa in Barbados?
Is it the... Countache rollin' up to your door? Yeah
Tell your roommate you ain't dancin no more, yeah
Tell 'em your new man is cooler than before, yeah
Tell 'em 'bout them twenty-thousand on tour, yeah
Is it the... the way that I defend your honor?
Backhand your ex-man, tell him kill the drama?
Is it the... way the Mazerrati hug her body
Make you wanna be my next hottie, uh-huh
From the bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruuuuuuuise... it don't stop
(Chorus w/o LL Cool J (1/2))"
30,Breakthrough,1987,Bigger And Deffer (1987),,LL Cool J,"Knuckleheads spreadin' gossip all over town
Every time I drive by you're just standin' around
Hundred-bottles in your pocket, forty-dog in your hand
Don't you know you're just a worker and your boss is my man?
L.L. this, L.L. that, soon as I walk in the place
I wanna take my gun and shoot you in your muthafuckin' face
You're playin' me too close with the schemin' and games
I guess the beef and the bullshit is the price of fame
Movies, records, goin' on tour
Twenty-thousand people hip-hoppin' on the floor
Whole parties body-rockin', and everything's chill
Get back to New York, and the suckers act ill
See I fought with the devil, made a promise to God
I have experience in goin' all the way to the top
It's harder harder than hard
All the suckers are barred
You used to try to talk down now your ego is scarred
See the problem is you want what another man has
His car, his wife, or his razzamatazz
But that's weak, you gotta do work on your own
'Cause when you're rich you got friends
But when you're poor you're alone
So get your own on your own, it'll strengthen your soul
Stop livin' off your parents like you're three years old
Instead of walkin' like you're limp and talkin' yang about me
Why don't you take your monkey-ass and get a college degree?
Or write a rhyme and ride a bike and try to live carefree
Hope my message reaches you before you're seventy-three
A old man, when people ask you what you did with your life
You'll say ""I hated L.L. and I carried a big knife""
Every day is a chase, every day is a race
And every day you're being overpowered by my bass
Too much juice to be a deuce, I had to be a ace
It's like the fire's in my eyes and the gun's in my face
I'm stompin' stupid knuckleheads until they bleed
I'm the leader of the show, so it's up to me to lead
I'mma lead you away from drugs and petty crime
Lead you away from wack beats and rhyme
Lead you to that ticket line
So you can come in my show and watch the stars shine
Get busy, not dizzy, wanna teach the young
The last man who didn't listen ended up gettin' hung
Not that I killed him, it's just
He didn't wanna trust
The words of a master that's why you must
Take heed to the speech, it's gonna reach your ear
Don't try to say you can't hear 'cause the words are clear
Throwin' flurries, punks scurry and I bury the rest
You better hurry up and rock a rhyme and give it your best
'Cause tonight's the night we gonna see the big fight
Twelve-gauge on the stage in case it don't go right
E-Love drives a tank, he's strong like a truck
If you're cryin' while you're dyin' we ain't givin' a fuck
L.L. Cool J is on the microphone
Tellin' all you punk ducks ""Leave me the hell alone""
'Cause I'm rated X, born to snap necks
Straight up and down, no special effects
I'm the professor, the teacher, the hip-hop dean
If Russia bombed the U.S., they'd be scared to touch Queens
'Cause that's where I live, and this is what I give
Turnin' top-notch crews into fugitives
They run, they frightened, they hide from King Titan
Like a sniper when he's shootin' or a viper when he's bitin'
Here I am, tellin' the truth
And I'm spreadin' the word to my fellow youth
It goes man-to-man and jam-to-jam
I got hip-hop, rock, and love song fans
All you petty MC's in the state of New York
Gettin' a thousand for a show but you still wanna squawk
Can't get a decent contract, your beats ain't workin'
Dogged-out Pumas plus you're manager's jerkin'
Your mic sounds weak, remember that skeezer
I'm badder than Napoleon, Hitler or Caesar
I'm a hitman, but I'm not for hire
Fly girl's desire, the man you admire
Not only on the stage, I rock in the park
And I'm a killer in the daytime, and worse after dark
So don't never ever mess with the king of the sound
L.L. Cool J, the baddest around."
31,Bristol Hotel,1987,Bigger And Deffer (1987),,LL Cool J,"I know a fat girl, she wears a orange skirt
You give her twenty dollars and you can do work
She'll take food stamps and a traveller's cheque
Because her hair and her face and her life's a wreck
She wears a bright blonde wig, some high heeled pumps
She's down in the dumps so she's sellin' her rump
She's a hot little momma and she works every day
If you wanna pay to play, here's where she stays
She's at the...
(Bristol Hotel) Room 515
(The Bristol Hotel) Where that at? (Jamaica, Queens!)
I seen her standin' there, slutty as could be
Offering the putty for a itty-bitty fee
Every red light she'll come over to your ride
Or she's standin' in the doorway tellin' you to come inside
The Bristol Hotel, 'cause it ain't no thing
And her meat tastes better than Burger King
Japanese executives in three-piece suits
Glasses all foggy when they come in the place
The girlies in the Bristol, they're all in cahoots
He fell asleep and got robbed, and cold chumped his face at the...
Party people check the story 'cause the story is ill
It's the story of two men, one Harold, one Bill
They went inside the Bristol on a Saturday night
Harold was cool but Bill felt uptight
The girlies made attempts but Harold played it cool
""Never ever rush, that's the golden rule
I been comin' to the Bristol's ten years of my life
A-yo, what the hell? Yo, man that's my wife!""
(The...)
You see, a Bristol girl is a one of a kind
And if you know her good enough she won't make you stand on line
She'll let you inside, make you pay for the ride
Take off her pants and then it smells like somebody died
You say ""What the heck"", because you already paid
Not knowin' that the guy that went before you had AIDS
Bang bang boogie, she was so amusin'
Next week you're at the clinic gettin' blood transfusions
At the...

Kickin' your ass and you can ask Keith Sweat why

Yeah, uh-huh
Uh-huh, I can't explain it

You know it's that moment
It's just that moment
Y'knahmsayin? I can't explain it
Can't explain it
My love when we're together
You're the greatest, nobody does it better
When you hold me
I wish that I could be your, one and only
Nobody does it better
(Verse One)
I understand you want canaries on your hand
Masterpiece Roley, gold tri-color band
Cute wedding pictures sittin' on the nightstand
You don't wanna make it happen unless it's the right man
I know you won't touch me unless you trust me
You kiss me and hug me but still won't crush me
I'm kissin' on your neck real tender
Gentle as can be, but you still won't surrender
Let me kiss your eyes
Let the smell of the incense enhance the vibe
I pull back to stare at your eyes
Sittin' there quiet like I'm hypnotized
We kiss a little more, laugh and smile
Might even share a lollipop, you know my style
Kick your Charles Davids off, relax for a while
Let's pretend that we're walkin' down the aisle
I can't explain it
(Verse Two)
Straight up, you beautiful B
I don't think you understand what you doin' to me
On the couch witcha legs crossed, watchin TV
Shoe hangin' off the tip of your foot, you killin' me
Uh... then we kiss for real
I'm fully prepared, I'm already steel
You go to the bathroom for a second
I understand baby, I know what you checkin' (a-heh-heh)
That's when you come back and walk to me slow
That's when you change up and let it all flow
I'm kissin' on your belly ring nice and slow
I love to take my time, love to give you a show
Get the warm chocolate syrup to travel below
Use my ears like handlebars, take control
Ain't no sense in stayin calm and playin' the role
Baby relax, let me touch your soul
I can't explain it
(Verse Three)
My turn to get rocked, lifted out my socks
With sound effects and whatnot (mmm)
A little perfume above the right spot, just a touch
Never too much, I lick it like a Dutch
Two of my favorite numbers, you know what I mean
Add 'em up and they equal fifteen
You the 6... I needed you like a fix
I can see it my mind, I knew we was gon' click
I pick up the pace
You feel the stubble from my beard on your face
I look at your lips and take a taste
Switch it up I got my hands on your waist
We whylin out, we all over the place
I'm holdin' on with a strong embrace
You holdin' on and tryin' to keep the faith
Together we blast to outer space, I can't explain it"

You ever get to the point where you so frustrated
You ready to give up?
You ready to end it all?
Don't do it dog, word up
I don't care if you black, white, latin, asian, whatever
We all go through pain
When you can't think... use your soul baby
Preliminary discussions is over with, the verdict is in
I took the rap throne back
I reigned like krills in eighty-seven, my name is on the map
It feels like a razor down the middle of my back
They slept on my lyrical ability to blow
Gave another nigga credit for inventin my flow
I'm a child of God, witness the risin' son
From the cradle to the grave, I remain number one
This thing of ours, got competition takin' red showers
Grievin mothers callin 1-800-Flowers
My repoitoire burn your ashes in the urn
Is it God or money that really make the world turn?
Grab your gun, separate the ones from the real funds
Inhale deep and hold it in your lungs
The streets was requestin some original LL
A soundtrack for niggaz that was raised in {hell}
They lookin' for a leader that can guide 'em through the maze
Smoke filled rooms, breathin in purple haze
Po' nigga's on the bricks his whole life
He ain't got nuttin to live for, so fuckin' livin' right
But if you stay in the rain like hurricane
Gold melts down but it don't fear flames
Toxic, lethal, psychologically evil
Genocide was committed on the black people
And the ghetto is a trap with glass walls
Should I sell drugs, be a rap thug, or play ball?
We end up in the grave anyway
The average cat and LL Cool J
It's a never ending cycle, life and death
Until then may my mic stay blessed, to the death
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
I CAN'T THINK! Why do I feel I'm losin my mind?
I CAN'T THINK! Could it be the ill beats and rhymes?
I CAN'T THINK! Even though I'm a one of a kind
I CAN'T THINK! I want the paper, that's just the bottom line
I CAN'T THINK! Mo' murder every day around the way
I CAN'T THINK! I'd rather get paid and parlay
I CAN'T THINK! It's all about survival God
(Scratched] - ""You know the epilogue by James Todd"" - [Biggie Smalls)
(LL Cool J)
Put your life on the line, you runnin' out of time
The coroner's callin, she know she on a nigga mind
Amongst the dogs, real cats is hard to find
Even a nigga MOMS hate it when he start to shine
Get the money and run, dodge the devil and his sons
Spit powerful parables like a sermon has begun
Fuck the turntables up, leave the DJ awestruck
Attitude is WHAT, keep the razor blade tucked
Too much flossin'll get your reputation touched
Too much rappin'll get your big mouth shut
Protect your neck nigga, you'll get it in the gut
You wearin a vest? What if you get your throat cut
Sold your soul for a dollar, now you havin' bad luck
Used to keep a bad bitch in the crib baggin up
Player here, player there, nigga turned you out
But never told you beware
Never told you that black love supposed to be shared
And you never judge a woman by the texture of her hair
Fancy cars and gold teeth, G-strings and things
The almighty dollar replace the wedding ring
The Ark of the Covenant was held by a king
I ain't tradin my soul in for skins and chrome rims
(LL Cool J)
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it
Think about it yo, think about it!
The dawn, of a new millennium, came to pass
The world revolves around sex or cash
The black man's motto, ""Kiss my ass!""
Shorties in kindergarten are strapped, ready to blast
All I ever seen was killers and dopefiends
From FEDS Magazine to the heart of killer Queens
Bronx and Brooklyn and everything up in between
No matter what, you always got a Judas on your team
Givin' it to the world and I'm tellin' it like it is
Tossin lyrical daggers and sendin 'em in your wig
Know where the body's buried, I ain't sayin' where it is
Raised inside the ghetto, but damnit I WANNA LIVE!
The legendary master of lyrical combat
But ain't no competition, ain't nobody to go at
So I'ma take the time and spit a universal verse
Hit the streets with a blessin and erase the curse"
35,Candy,1997,Phenomenon (1997),,LL Cool J,"(Verse 1: LL Cool J)
When you was seventeen and I was nineteen
We feel deep in love growing up in Queens
We didn't know a thing about love
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug
Held you tightly and promised you the world
You gave me hickys and said you was my girl
When I think about it now makes me smile
'Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades
We used to live for love but now we're afraid (of what?)
Of the darkness and bitter memories
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity
I promised you I'd love you to the end
Always and forever since way back when
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend
You taste better now than you did back then
(Chorus: Bell/Tresvan)
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(You'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl understand me
You will always be my candy girl
(Verse 2: LL Cool J)
While you sucked caramel apple lolly pops
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock
We used to walk down the block hold hands
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man
And any guys that wanna socalize
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that trys
My peeps used to say I was whipped
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt
I would look up at ya I remember
The afternoon you surrendered
We made love the tempature was high as could be
You said Todd promise you ain't liein' to me
And as we went our separate ways you turned back
Smiled I remember all that
(Verse 3: Bell/Tresvant, LL Cool J)
(Take it to the bridge)
Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy gir
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and every day
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call
Of days when love was true I slept and held you
Taste the brown sugar let your climax melt yo
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me
Sweet love strictly
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side
Take you for a mental and emotional ride
Make love to your soul your heart and your mind
In your hour of need girl I'll be there every time
And as long as you support my dreams
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love
(Outro: Bell/Tresvant)
Candy gir
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special trea

Nothin', can save ya
Nothin' can save ya
[Scratched] Nothin'
Just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
Keep 'em there
Yo, run the jewels, run the jewels, run the jewels
[Scratched] Can you feel it
I used to be rollin' like a millionaire
Cash in a flash, bankroll to spare
Homeboys hangin', champagne and girls
Got my main woman Diamonds, my mistress Pearls
Everybody laughin' at my corny jokes
I was stupid; I thought that they were sincere folks
It turned out they liked the money and the fame
If I ain't get paid, I'd be that nobody James
The nobody, who dreamed about bein somebody
Chief rocker at the party
And they was hangin' like, ""Yo, I'm your man
I don't even care about the ring on your hand""
We'd go out to eat and chill
But they would go to the bathroom when it was time to pay the bill
I didn't notice all the chuckles and laughter
Too busy with a female tellin' me I'm the master
I was slick like, ""Huh, do I know you?
I got play, here, let me show ya""
Used to have a girl that was on the ball
When the cash flow got low, so did her calls
Used to have a homeboy, always chillin'
My cash went low, he told me I was illin
And don't call 'cause he don't hang with derelicts
Broke with no cash, yo, I was in the mix
Everybody stepped cause my pocket wasn't fat
My girl got a new man, I fixed his flat
I'm the one that they're laughin' at
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that""
(Chorus: BizMarkie again)
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Nothin' can save ya
I mean crabbin, played out by backstabbin; I feel like tiein
A anchor to my ankle and jumpin' right in the ocean
'Cause I'm ashy and I can't afford lotion
So-called friends in the jewelry store
Told me, ""Todd, come back when you get off tour""
Souped as hell, I really regret it
Now the only thing I got in my pocket is bad credit
How can a man like me
Be walkin' around in a world of misery?
And if women like a man with a body, it's not mine
'Cause they be walkin' past me like I'm a stop sign
My homeboys laugh when they pass the forty
Sayin', ""Todd, as if he used to have a sporty""
The Benz was slammin', the Jeep was pumpin
Ain't that somethin'?
I just laugh, this isn't what I was raised for
When I walk away, it's like ain't this a
Kick in the rear, that I'm standin here
And can't afford a tissue for my tear
Should I drink wine and brandy
Or get a job puttin' stripes on candy
Or put a hole in donuts?
'Cause when you're broke, your middle name is ""so-what?""
I had to learn in an incredibly fast way
When you ain't got no money they treat you like an ashtray
I pawned all my jewelry and clothes
Right after that, I got dissed by all the hoes
That I thought was mine, but really never was
Soon the whole neighborhood got the buzz
That my tank was on ""E"", and that means empty
That Twinkie looks good, so mister don't tempt me
Everybody thought I was trippin'
I rode the back of the bus, but my grip kept on slippin
I'm the man that they're laughin' at
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that""
I wanna hang with my man like, ""Let's do this""
But this man like ""Who this?""
That's right, the brother got two faces
They got me puttin' the tips on shoelaces
P on the Puma, a mop and a bucket
My motto is... I don't care
I don't give a damn, so what, why try?
I might as well rob some Blake Carrington sucker for his money
It's so funny
Cars ride by with the boomin system
Sayin', ""Leave him alone, my man already dissed him""
Now I'm on the cheeseline, poverty-stricken
As the red tape thickens
I go to the park, they wanna baseball-bat me
I go to the mall, they throw my old tapes at me
I'm so horny
And every girl I know be like, ""He's so corny""
I want money in a hurry
I'm gettin' tired of leftover curry
I wanna fall off, but I don't know where the edge is
I'm so hungry, I eat my neighbor's hedges
Now I realize I gotta go for mine
It's windshield time
I take quarters, pennies, dimes and nickles
And a kiddy's tricycle
I'm a desperado
""I'ma steal your rims"" is my motto
I watch wrestlin until I'm dizzy sore
So if you're cashin your rent check, know how to get busy
Go to the drive-through, run with a milkshake
Go to the supermarket, pocket a raw steak
I need beer
I'ma catch the Miller truck out there
You know how they throw, the newspapers in the morning
The owner don't want em
I'm the man that they're laughin' at
They say, ""Cheesy rat, you ain't all that.""
So yo, one more time, one more time
Party people in the house tonight
Just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
Keep 'em there
Run the jewels, run the jewels, run the jewels"

How you gon' sleep on me holmes, do I look like a mattress?
Am I that old, do I walk like Grady?

Don't you EVER try to rock my house
I'm a real cool cat, know what I'm sayin' Mickey Mouse?

You smoke I'm no joke, so my brother break out the looseys
And take a pull, cause the buck stops here
I get swift as a magician, wreck {shit} and disappear
Don't cross me, or lose your loyalty
To the Prince of the Rap Court, I'm royalty
And it ain't no puzzle, it's a shame how rappers guzzle
Paragraphs I put together so I carry a muzzle
To shut 'em up and cut 'em up and make 'em be quiet
I'm a one man RIOT, so don't even TRY IT
The Prince of special tactics, plus I'm athletic
Before you play your hand you better do some calisthetics
Jumpin' jacks, squats, push-ups, the whole nine
Speak your piece, then I'ma go for mine
And I guarantee you, I'm gonna strike again
I recommend my friend you drop the pen and give in
Cop out to one rhyme 'cause you're facin ten
I ain't Sidney Poitier but we can 'Do This Again'
I'm nice wit mines, and I gotta admit it
You don't really wanna battle, why don'tcha just forget it!
(LL Cool J)
But if you're hard headed and you still don't understand
Here's a little sample -- EHM EHM, my man

Check my stats, how we livin', I thought so
I'm fresh, oh yes, but can they flow, hell no
My rhymes are up to date, excellent, on point
I'm tellin' you, they're the serious joint
I eat my steak fast, I drink my brew slow
My voice is milky with a nice clear flow
I eat like a fat man, and walk like a gigolo
I'm not a ballplayer, so now Y'KNOW!
Clap your hands everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)
'Cause I rock the house, everybody (aiyyo)
And everybody just clap your hands (aiyyo)
KnowhatI'msayin? And I'ma be straight till the year 3000
That's word to mother, knahmsayin?

Knahmsayin? That's what time it is, peace

You was reminiscin and wishin
For L to deliver what the game's been missin'
Beast that knock rhymes that lock with precision
Hot like when Pac first popped out of prison
Two schools of thought headed for a collision
Did it big for a minute then you lost yo vision
Skinny jeans, a wedgy and a dance rendition
Tycoons wouldn't choose that mission
These cats is all hyped, that's why I don't listen
I'm too tank fittin right, I see y'all slippin
Ain't no hate love, nah I ain't trippin'
Still love jewelry and champagne sippin
Bank roll healthy, ice is still sickening
Couldn't get fresh if you broke up, get slicking
We Diddy bop, y'all out here skippin
Baby just ignore these fools, they trippin'

Bishop Lamont, need to give 'em a sermon
How soon we forget when the chrome is turnin'
Models in the backseat burnin
But even if I wasn't LL Cool J
I had the same girl that I have today
And that's not something most of these cats could say
Your whole hand's different than you're payin', a mistake
Now some of y'all gonna feel some kind of weight
That's yo prop in which you, you know how we play
Grown, we're the bad, grinding all day
Fool, you got a edge when you take that away baby
The moment of truth and the jacuzz on
Like that news, play some rhythm and blues
Worry 'bout the water baby, leave on your shoes
Toast to the gold, my heart don't lose
Give it up

LL - grown up man
Couldn't give a damn if a young boy's my fan
Long as his mama 2 step to my jam
While she cleanin up her house, mop in her hand
It's how I changed the game, now you understand?
I got that old money, weak rubber bands
Cats playin' themselves, getting out of hand
Show two features to chase teenage fans
Well I got it right, I cram to understand
How you trendy shorty, L's a brand
Raised on hip-hop, the grownup fans
Hands in the air, rocking in a stance
I've been made, ain't no making of the bands
Save the techno and glow sticks for Disneyland
I'm sayin' 5 features on every other jam
You like them? Listen to em, we don't give a damn
Give it up
I'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop

If this ain't Vegas, let's pretend it's Vegas
I know what you up to, your skirt's outrageous
But I'm so fucked up that I forgot what your name is
We can jump in my drop-head and pop the throttle
Live our lives for the moment, baby, fuck tomorrow
Kool-Aid smile on your face, popping a bottle
Like you had an orgasm and you hit the lotto
Throw ya hands in the sky, why, am I
So, damn fly, can't deny
My shit's tight, gear, sit right
Ear, big ice, j-yeah, that's right
Lights are flashing, living life with passion
And if this was a movie, you would be perfect casting
You killing me slowly, baby, you're like an assassin
And you know that I'm married, so why the fuck you keep asking

Now you can get with this or you can get with that
You wanna pop Crys', then you need to get with Crack
The whip's a 26 and the motor's in the back
I call it Big Meats 'cause the shit is all black
Now you fucking with Coco, baby, I'm the poster, baby
I'm a hustler's dream, you suppose to pay me
I was dope in the airness, now I stick crack
I stay fly, you seen a G four on smack, now listen
Don't you wanna party with me?
Where the kush is blowing and the E is free
And the world is yours, it say it right on the blimp
And that yacht's so big, we gotta call it a ship, hey
Punks nigga, gun in the palm, nigga
Pop off, whenever it's on, nigga
Not tonight, I wanna hear my song
And let Flex drops bombs when the shit come on, let's get it

Ok, Flex let Sheek on his Cool J shit
Levi's, black chuckers, hope the deuce deuce fit
Two-seater, little reefer, pass the old fever
Showing her what hip hop is
Todd Smith, G. Rap, nigga, Kane and Biz
And if I talk L.O.X., I'm getting heavy sex
This early, imagine when it get to Flex
Toxic heavy, all black Chevy
Sheek got 'em wet, like somebody hit the levy's
I got a little Porsche, but the truck fit more
More goons, more chicks, when it's time to score
I'm straight out the door, boned from a raw
Swimming pool bottom of it, big as Shakur

Partying, no shirts, tats over the scar

The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggle
She said
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad (Be bad)
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna
Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're waddling like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic
Her gaze was so hypnotic
I bet this girl will stop it
But she continued to pop it
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the afterparty is at my body
Meet me you're invited
She said
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad (Be bad)
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Say what)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna
She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth
Side, to side, and up, and down
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you (make me hurt you)
She said
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself (Oh)
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad (Be bad)
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Say what)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya

The rain pours down
Eyes are blood-shot
Heartbeat pounds.
Lights go out
The whole world's in darkness
The ground is tremblin'
Dogs are barkless.
In the sky there appears a great light
Burnin' all the flesh off the creatures of the night.
Ah! Cryin' in a childless (?) tone
Terrified of dyin' a painful death alone.
Don't smile
Lest a innocent (?) chile
The power of god is gonna get to be your tal (?).
Throw like a hit from the best
Take it in a slump
Ha ha
Feel it in your chest.
Conquerin the world with the words
Leadin the children like herds.
I can feel it buildin
I'm about to explode
I'm walkin' on the crossroad
People livin' in a shack - at the crossroads
Little kids sellin crack - at the crossroads
(?) Stab you in the back - at the crossroads
Everybodies gettin' jacked at the crossroads
Violins and trumpets play
25 thousand people in a golden sleigh
On there way to the promise land.
Deliverance
But yet some don't understand.
Rough on a late night thrill
After midnight
Kill or be killed.
Soldiers, warriors
(?) At each other
On the combat zone.
Supreme power on the throne.
Lighting strikes in every home.
Terrified men run down the street.
So many dead bodies
It's hard to eat.
Come, we gotta rise
Above the wall.
To see what no man has seen before.
Blindin' light
That got you through the night.
God is on your side
To got in a fight.
Homicide
Suicide
Death.
BOOM!
Ain't nobody left.
Oh! It's startin to take affect.
Your on your knees
You scared to death.
Tornados with a thousand people spinnin.
One fight at the cross
And now god is winin.
The whole Earth cracks in half.
The sea turns red from the blood bath.
Abandoned buildings burned
And two remain (?).
Terrified
You feel the fire blaze.
The ground can't hold your weight.
You reach out to grab the pearly gates.
Who clocked this f***
Not from space.
Never again
Will you see the human race.
19 angels leadin the devil straight to hell!
Torment!
Pain!
What you're seein here
You can't explain.
All your life
Some men
We played the game.
Never realize that there's a flame."

Keep it hustle when times are tough,
Never left me stranded it was all about us,
Kept coming home,
Kept running strong,
This love is meant to be life long,
Life is good when it's me and you together,
And when there's drama then imma do what ever,
Keep you warm in the stormy cold weather,
Leave you broken and lonely Oh never,
Every work that I say is so clever,
When you feel it in your heart it gets you much wetter,
I am the original go getter,

Stare at the devil and won't blink for ya girl,
Change the way that I think for ya girl,
Put it on paper waste the ink for ya girl,
Walk through the dessert without a drink for ya girl,

Step in quicksand and sink for ya girl,
Whatever the obstacle imma leap for ya girl,
End my life and go to sleep for ya girl,

His realm is a new horizon of cuts
They expand from his hand as he conducts
Aim a lot of cool projects not photography
Cut-Creator, Philly-Phil's biography
(LL Cool J)
The lyrical virtual also makes his return
All adversaries should be concerned
LL Cool J is back again
Let me allow to introduce you to my friend Cut-Creator
(LL Cool J)
He circumcises DJ's while he's on the airwaves
Till the missions' complete, you're a musical slave
English revision he endour any collision
Like a searcher with a scapal, he'll make the head decision
As for me I'll annihilate, eggs, I'll let's 'em communicate
You from rappin' and my lyrics are the best
Slow down the rap but not the subject matter
All you sucker DJ's will scatter
Cut-Crea-tor will employ techniques that will absorb toy boy
The real helper of cuts, Cut-Creator is his name
The boys' so nice, my boat is your strain
You could re-arrange but you don't have the brains
To arrange scratch-padders for the audio change
Not trippin' ah, my tree, for the mental geometry
Just Cool J, that's me, I'm dangerous
""I Need A Beat"" - (cut and scratched)
(LL Cool J)
Yeah I made it, don't look astonished
I had to remind you of what I've accomplished
My scenario, four-door stereo
Up-bein' beat, zero is the ratio
Cut-Creator, LL Cool J
Say: ""Ole"", to what we just played
Rappers who don't evade instead we invade
And all competitors will be slayed
Any comment is a compliment
No groups' talent can be the equivalent
Of mine and his combined
Total harmony between the cuts and the rhyme
So why listen the greats by the deaf of the bass
Takin' out every sucker, DJin' the place
A performance underated, it's not narrated
So Cut-Creators social statics can't be alleviated
He's dangerous
(LL Cool J)
Demolishin' DJ's in under a second
I called an old phrase from my last record
The beat alleviates, the scratch excels
Except I came hear to raise some hell
Searchin' up sykes and cuts like the blade
He the scuser dry-smudge and make Coolay
I drink at steady, the record turns many
Instead of a needle, he uses a machette
He scuffs the bars a-get you involved as the record revolves
DJ's dissolve, usually, physically, mentally
He's an innovator, greator, Cut-Creator is on the cross-fader
Sometime I gotta check what I invest
All Farmers Boulevard is where I rest
I'm numero uno, amigo with an ego
Such palms kill a France, say: En Italiano
The mouth protects and I'll inject into your ears
A new concept cuts soon in silence to be unfair
To the Cool J phenomena, all must hail
I'm dangerous

""You better stop foolin if you want to get along with me""
True
""We grew up on the block, and we know about poverty""
Do you?
Dear hip-hop, I apologize for how you've been treated
I should've fought for my culture, instead I retreated
The game is wounded, I stood and watched while they beat it
My culture starved, I refused to feed it
They sold you for a dollar like slaves in iron collars
A*R's chase you with bloodhounds and rottweilers
You went to the highest bidder, you was pissed on like kitty litter
But far from a quitter, but there's somethin' to consider
Nah, after much deliberation
I decided I'm the hottest cat to ever receive rotation
I'm the foundation, one of the chief architects
Of this dream we're all chasin, I had to speak up
Too much time was wastin Whoa~! So here we go
I'm tired of the money talk and the, bitches and hoes
Everybody's always, soundin the same
I have to walk on water I can't, drown in the game
(Chorus 2X: scratched samples)
""Hip-Hop, was set out in the dark"" {*3X*}
""They used to do it out in the park""
(LL Cool J)
I remember your bar mitzvah, that burgundy label
Me and Jam Master had the battle of the big cables
Before the Serratos, real vinyls, real tables
Skills was the motto, no hype, no fables
You seemed so happy, you loved me so much
You popped off and went platinum, at my slightest touch
Oversized hoodies, Yukon trucks
20 years later, it's like lightning struck
They're worshipin the money, they're prayin' to the bank
They danced on slaveship, slept as it sank
The devil made 'em do it, but only God do I thank
Because we aren't done yet, there's still gas in the tank
You look in a man's eyes, that's how you really tell his rank
Not the size of his account, check him, he might bounce
It's all on the line, this time it really counts
I'll bleed for this one, on down to the last ounce
(LL Cool J)
They rent a crib they're frontin, they rent a car they're stuntin
They rent a chain they're bluffin, that's why the culture's sufferin
And even if you're a millionaire that don't mean nothin'
Unless you build your community and encourage some unity
Too much ego... too much posin
If he's so hot then, why's the culture frozen?
It's time for a change, the order needs to be rearranged
And this song was pre-ordained
After 2 long decades, LL still remains
And you can blame it on my spirit, not on my brains
Time to put on my armor, go to war for the game
'Cause it's on its last leg, and that's more than a shame
This is a lifestyle homey, it's more than champagne
But I will make a toast to Flash reachin' the Hall of Fame
I end it with a line, from the book of King James
Let there be light when I write graffiti on the train
(LL Cool J - repeat 2X)
Let us proclaim the mystery and fame
I pray the Lord my culture be saved
If hip-hop dies before I awake
May Jam Master Jay cut a LL break"

They're so bad, baby you might have to skip town
See something's smellin' fishy and they say it's you
All I know is that you made it with the whole damn crew
They say you're a man-eater during the full moon
Mascot of the senior boys' locker room
They said Yvette walked in, there wasn't too much rap
Her reputation got bigger, and so did her gap
'Cause girl your momma shoulda taught you better
I'mma sit down and write you a long letter.
Dear Yvette [x4]
I'm glad you ain't my sister, then again if you was
I'd have to treat you like you was my distant 'cause
I'm not a news reporter, I don't mean to assume
What should I think? I seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom
You wasn't in there alone, wasn't usin' the phone
The door was locked for twenty minutes, all I heard was ""Moan"".
I don't really know if the story is so
I can either ask Curly, or Larry or Moe
Or Earl, Shabazz, Lou, Mookie or Joe
Like Santa Claus said, you're a ho-ho-ho
In every disco you say hello
Like you're a little angel, but we all know
Since you was eleven you been actin' this way
You always got in bed when you wanted to play
You're a freak, you think you're Lady Godiva
Some freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver.
You're a back-seat queen, a elevator pro
A high-powered body makes your Levis grow
See the stories I've heard, they could amaze
I heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days
So calm down freak, get a G.E.D.
That's a General Education on Decency
One day you'll see, and agree with me
Unless you're gonna be a freak until you're 93
For you there's no fee, everything is free
This is from me to you, not you to me
Every night is your night, your leather pants are tight
You try to shake your butt with all your might
I don't really wanna dis nobody
You might think I had a little too much Bacardi
But that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette
How bad can a girl's reputation get?
See she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met
If you're desparate ask Yvette, 'cause she'll say ""Bet"".
B-Boys are hard on the boulevard
The Reverend at the church said you was barred
Homeboys on the block love you a lot
You're a real famous freak whether you like it or not
So before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'
Let me explain to you who is talkin'
I'm L.L. Cool J from around the way
You boogie down to my records almost every day
Go a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still
You're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill
Won't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A.
The guy at the desk said it was OK
For you to come inside 'cause he knew you'd stay
Greg G. and Garfield yelled ""Hooray"""

Suckers all weird, no let the best go migo
They talk and talk, I invade and take over
Forget Mako, you gonna need a make-over
I'm ferocious, animalistic, an animal
On the mic - I'm a cannibal
I eat livers, hearts, legs and arms
They crown me the King of doin' nothin' but harm
I'm two with the Universe and I'ma make you
Diverse, make I kill quick, so you'll win from crew to hers
I'ma Titan, keepin' you frightened
I went to the Motherland, so now I'm enlightened
There's a...
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
(LL Cool J)
For bow-take to far cynical of Egypt
Cool J I'm slay and I'm fully equipped
To decapatate, amputate and take titles
The legend of leather, I'ma real live idol
Damn I take souls, condemn we men
And make microphones men again and again
Cause, I'm blood thirsty watch and try to curse me
You'll lose the battle even if you out re-hearsed me
I'ma rip holes watch heads roll, like a mole
When I'm strollin' with my neck on a goal
My battles' like a blackout, you can't back out
Only difference, no time to feel a track out
It's a...
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
(LL Cool J)
So come forward, admit you're guilty
Admit that your thoughts of New Jack killed me
Admit you were sleepin' on the skills of L
Now know that I handle mine, very well
I burn buildings, eat emcee's
Smack DJ's and tell the seated girls please
They try to jam hard, but I'ma fan God
And they could never get a piece of the man Todd
King Posse ruler and high roller
You losin' it son, your games' gettin' colder
It's a...
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland

I'm a Monar, the Warlord of life
The eliminator, and I'ma score tonight
Somethin' like Murley, but it goes much deeper
Now just another rapper with a chain and a beeper
One sample is ample, four emcees'll get trampled
Bein' absent from God, I'ma give you sample
My vocabulary's legendary, my rumpy your temporary
So what your name in the bituary
Step back the conqueror spreads his wings
Kindergarten rappers, I'm back to change things
I rock the clearest, one hell of a learer
Since I can't miss and I'm kinda like a chemist
When I put a potion together it's splendid and fatal
You can never make a move on me 'cause you're still premado
Grip the mic tight sometimes I get calasis
And when I'm through you face baralysis
I'm gettin' thinner, watch me eat dinner
I'm down to skinner beginner to be a winner
It's a...
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
(LL Cool J)
Who gets the roughest, you know the answer
You're a dandelion, I'm a panther
When I pick up the mic, as my fist see mo'
King of Rackadochio, I'm magnifigo
When I rock, hearts roll on and walk bad
'Cause I know it's makes the face-sucker-ducks mad
I came back to smack wifes and pull cards
Introducin' the original Todd
Just like a bloodhound but I got this spellbound
Your rhymes are snowbound and I can throwdown
I'm like a thundercloud, I drop heavy
Hold steady, get ready, your petti confetti
Techniques and styles - they ain't ready
Ah, ah, yeah - full of horsepower and I'ma devour
Stay clean when I scream you're soft las cauliflower
I set the track and record you like a brown mouse
Then flick and do a Bruce Lee 'roundhouse
No threat exist, no man can stand
Say mic check and expect to take the man
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland, uh"

50,Do Wop,1987,Bigger And Deffer (1987),,LL Cool J,"L.L. Cool J
Servin' 'em well
And as you all know...
I am - hard - as hell
Woke up at 9:30 on a Saturday morn'
Hemmed my remote control, turned my stereo on
Then I reached for a brush since I don't use the picks
And the floor was kinda cold, so I put on my kicks
Walked to the kitchen and ate some cornflakes
As I bop to a tape of Cut Creator's breaks
With hardcore - heavyweight - b-boy blast
Connoisseur of hardcore, and Cut Creator's fast
Jumped in the shower, it was boiling hot
So I stayed there a hour, 'cause I like it a lot
Jumped out, dried off, put on the Denim cologne
Then I called up Earl on the telephone
He told me 'bout a jam that I could do later on
10 g's plus a limo for one strong song
So I said, yeah, I was with it, hung up and got geared
Got a magnfying glass, then I brushed my beard
Rewound some tapes of some Def Jam tunes
As I waited for this freak to ring my bell at noon
12 o'clock came, left the door crack
The freak walked in, a mink on her back
Put her curt on the rack, threw my ??? on
Then I threw in a tape of the quiet storm
We drank Roundhill Cavern, ate soft mignons
She said, ""L.L., when you're gonna let me taste your tongue?""
My skin got pale, I wam-bammed the tail
Did it so hard I shoulda went to jail
She left, Earl came over and we went outside
Jumped in the BM to bust a joyride
Went up to A.J., in my fresh black wheel
I'm not a sucker on the corner tryin' to scrape up a meal
The girlies want sex, the fellas try to plex
But those who flex end up with broke necks
Signed some autographs for a posse of freaks
Said, ""It's L, baby, I ain't down with Chic""
Conversated with the skeezers for 10 minutes more
Then I jumped in my ride and the freaks slammed the door
Due 'cause I'm a gangster people think I do crimes
They don't know I'm just a connoisseur of hip-hop rhymes
Some smile, try to call L.L. a hoodlum at times
But he don't know my autograph's on his wife's behind
L.L. has iced all the washed up slobs
Vigilante of rap, so to hell with the mob
Don't run from the cops, makin' suckers jock
And I'm only 18 makin' more than your pops
Tormentor of toys and boyscout boys
And I dare any critic to call it noise
Peeped at the clock, it said 6:03
Said 'later' to Creator and broke out with E
Went up to White Castle for a chocolate shake
Thinkin' 'bout a 100'000 that I'd soon make
Finished up the snack, jumped up, out my seat
E-Love hit the table and he made up a beat
Kicked a few lines, stepped out the door
Since tonight is a bore I'm in the mood for more
We jumped in my ride, I took a peek at the time
It was almost 7:30 and the show was at nine
L.L. Cool J will soon stand at a jam
With thousands of people screamin, ""Touch my hand!""
But since I had a hour plus a half for tat
I was searchin for the cutie who's my perfect match
Her name was Renee, her face was okay
But she had the kinda body that made Jay wanna play
I said, ""No need to rehearse,"" then I made my approach
Said, ""You got a good team, girl, but you need a new coach""
Said, ""My name's L.L. - Cool, if I may introduce
But I'm not here for conversation, I'm here to seduce
Wanna mix it up, baby, wanna feel you grind
Cause it ain't 5th grade, and these ain't nursery rhymes
And I know that you adore my sure side hardcore
Check out the real L.L. behind closed doors
So tell your buddies you're busy, tell your boyfriend beat it
Forget the silk dress, cause you ain't gonna need it
Unplug your clock, do away with the light
After five minutes or more you hear me say, 'That's right!'
Your body is bad and I heard you got a Caddy
When we make love you can call me daddy
I'm L.L. Cool J, say hey, Renee
I'm not a toyboy, but I still wanna play
Promise you I'm not wack when I'm in the sack
After that I leave you starvin for me to come back
But in the meantime, put your digits down
And the next time I see ya I'm goin' to town""
Stepped away from the freak, it was a quarter to nine
When I rolled to the jam I saw the crew on line
Took a trip around the side, so I could get backstage
If you call me a tiger, then the stage is my cage
I rip, stomp and crush, heavy metal bands rust
Them flaky knuckleheads I crumble up like crust
Walked in my dressing room, and then I heard four knocks
They said, ""L.L., you're runnin' late and it'is time to rock""
Told Cut Creator what the order would be
Then I said ""Lord have mercy"" and slapped hands with E
Went onstage, I heard the girlies scream
And that's the very moment I woke up from the dream
Ah!"

More flesh than the greek fest,
L: Roll up the sess.
J: Pass the Hennessee,
L: Put my body to the test.
Way way back many niggas ago,
I was a young girl listening to how you flow.
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown.
From the back, from the side,
J: Right, I'm in the zone.
One of a kind when it's time to do mine.

It's been a long time
People change
I missed U
Word up
I used 2 always think about U
Even though sometimes I see U
And I try to ignore U
Deep inside I was thinkin' about U
What'd you think
(Tamia)
You are, my life
I have to go on
Havin' me, anyway you want me baby
Just love me till the tension's gone
And don't you come, too soon
(LL)
I'm patient, I never come too soon
When I kissed U, U said it was the same old tune
But I missed U, my life was filled with gloom
I was hopeless sittin' in an empty room
When you re-appeared I was back in the mix,
I put the key up in the lock 'cause true love fixed
All the drama got 2 stop baby no more tricks
My broken heart was addicted, but now it's fixed
And I cherished you forever, believe me U,
U's a priceless treasure from my point of view
It took time to change, I'll admit that,
My back-in-the-day's love, I had to get back
Chorus (Tamia)
You are my starship
Come take me up tonight
And don't be late, you are
My starship, come take me up tonight
And don't be late,
And don't you, come too soon
(LL)
I never thought that I would ever lay beside you again,
Tastin' every inch plus bein' your friend
Romantic nights with shootin' stars and full moons,
Kiss the Rose better till it come full bloom
Can you feel it, passion overflows in waves,
Keep it steady, providin' everything you crave
Now you ready, I like that, my love you save,
I love it when a bad girl agrees to behave
It's the motion that makes your love affair complete,
But devotion, makes it all twice as sweet
Back together, reunited, bonded once more,
Before I was hesitant, but now I'm sure
Bridge (LL)
Well, now you know how I feel
And I definitely know how you feel
Word up
I'm feelin' this
Word up
'Cause with you by my side
I'ma take it to the top, yeah

Had this hot club shootin my video
They was burnin up the floor to that reggaeton
Start to bailando soon as they put the record on
I was sweatin like a bullfighting matador
It was the sexiest scene that I ever saw
(La fiesta, tu mi a fuego)
But I was still cool in my light blue Kangol
I met this girl, she was off the chain yo
Cooley head model from San Diego
Father was from Trinidad, Tobago
Mother was from Rio, de Janeiro
She said please don't think I'm crazy
But I've been in love with you since the 80's
{?} Cansando baby
Have you ever been with a latin lady
Uh, she said there's one thing you should know
(Just here to find to numero uno)

(If I can get wit'cha)

She said I wanna get wit'cha
I'm talkin' more than an autograph and picture
(Tu quiere, benita mi casa)
I mumbled to myself, she's a monster
She said (yo no se lo que no habla)
Don't worry 'bout it lil' mama nada
The chemistry and energy was gettin' hotter
This ain't like me but I feel like I gotta
She started movin near me
Whispered in my ear so I could hear more clearly
Said grab my waist and look in the mirror
Then started windin it like Shakira
All that shakin and belly dancin
I was goin' under, I ain't stand a chance man
If I do this, will I love it or regret it
Tempted and I don't know where this is headed

Pullin on my arm, wouldn't let go
Rubbin my face, kissin' my neck slow

Just like Pauline you all-in...
Oooooah
Brace yourself, I'm the ace with grace
I'ma win the race and make you feel disgrace
In any case, yo, I'm movin like a steeplechase
MC soldiers -- about face
Now step off, I need room for my takeoff
My custom made lyrics slays, yours are soft
I think you better tape this, yo, you can't escape this
Yo, I planned it out just like a landscapist
Whipper-snapper back up for comin' crap up
I plan to trap a MC and kidnap em
Phony, so skip the baloney
You and your cronies need to jump on a pony
And roll, 'cause you're just a rookie
When it was time for rap school, you musta played hooky
I'm the show-stopper, your rhymes are improper
I'ma teach you like the master taught the grasshopper
Just gettin' warmer, I'm a transform a
Regular rhyme into a barnstormer
Try to jump I'll bump you chump, my job is thorough
Any MC, state city or borough'll get ragged
I drop like a sandbag
Serious as the mob - I don't play tag
Best of the batch, no man can catch up
Hoes can't be passed, a battle's a mistmatch
I flip lyrics, like a acrobat
And avoid combat like a diplomat
But when it's time for battles, ?? jacked or killed
It's a thrill to drill a run of the mill Bill
With my skill, I'm the lord of the rhymes
And I be writin at a rate that pace way past my bedtime
I rock the mic unlike
Some brothers I know, I guess they flow, PSYCH
I'm droppin' em
Droppin' em
Yo, you're all in, stiff as a mannequin
I'm sharp as a pen and I'ma teach discipline
I get busy like it's two of me
Evidently, I'm hated by a few MC's
But so what? I just max like I'm playin' the sax
And take the crowd to the climax
Yo - Cool J, I'll never go astray
I'm funky you can hear me at the Milky Way
You're weak, wick raps, I'm cool as jazz
Got razamatazz ask my man Shabazz
I know you're afraid because I'm self-made
I invade, and blow up like a hand grenade
MC's are terrorstruck, I'ma run amuck
Cause your rhymes suck, you made a record on potluck
Just a toy boy, can't stop my convoy
Rhymes I said last year were just decoys
I'm like a fox, you annoy me like chicken pox
I'm back with a style that's unorthodox
You musta had a teaspoon full of bull
I'm like The Hulk, with more bulk, I'm powerful
They try to get with this, to me that's an insult
Boys shouldn't mess with an adult, that's too difficult
I enter like a giant sayin' fee fi foe fum
Then rock the auditorium until it's pandemonium
I'm droppin' em
Yo E, droppin' em
Don't sleep - 'cause I'ma go deeper
All you sleepers, I'm the Grim Reaper
My rhymes are rising, the angle's gettin' steeper
I hated Mussolini Martini so I'ma sweep a
Emcee, like he's one of the two
Break him into fragments right in front of you
Mic check one two, is too fundamental
In the center, I had to enter
Tormentor mentor experimentor and inventor
Of lyrics, so all you non-believers
It'll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a
Rude awakening, you can't do anything
You enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring
Gifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence
Alarm clock rings, you wake up, and you're convinced
That the crew invader, soloist exterminator
Greater evador of ducks, concert crusader
Is BAD, my nickname's the circuit breaker
Eatin up the world, acre by acre
I'm droppin' em

Come with it, if you feel you're full-fledged
Or yell ""Geronimo!"" and jump off the edge

It's so visual the way I'm throwin' down
Visualize MC's goin' down
In a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes
The moral of the story is: I'ma get mines
I saw the cord-less, boy, I'm gonna house that
Your rhymes are cheesy, you found 'em in a mouse trap
Don't try to front while the freestyle's droppin'
He wants to battle, he must be needle-poppin'
You better notify your next akin
'Cause when I begin it's like a needle to the skin
If you wasn't prepared
Then you ought to be scared
But even if you was
You're aware what the rhyme does
I remember when you was an amateur
Writin your rhymes, starin' at my signature
Bought the album, analyzed the style
Tisk-tisk (Hatchew!) God bless you, child
I'm unique when I speak to a beat
Another rapper'll fall when the mission's complete
I daze and amaze, my display's a faze
Every phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays
The competition that's lost in a freestyle
Cause on the mic I'm the golden child
With the magical wand that they're callin a mike
And when MC's approach it turns into a spike
Chill

And my man Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation
Know what what I'm sayin'
My man Marley Marl and DJ Clash
My man B-Blast

We in the house
Of course I gotta say what's up to my homeboys EPMD
Yeah
I get busy

(Sip somethin')
Uh, sip somethin'
(Sip somethin')
I wouldn't drink that, if I was you
(Chorus + (LL Cool J))
With every sip of my drink (uh)
I get a little bit closer (uh-huh)
And when I'm tryin' to re-think (yeah)
I can't really get focused (uh, uh)
I wasn't tryin' to be mean
I can see that it's hopeless (uh)
Cause your persistence overpowers me
I know you rollin' out with me
(Verse One)
I was stayin at the Shore Club, leanin in the red room
Seen this tan mami, she was fresh off the sand dunes
Big bottles and models and poom-pooms
Surroundin my table, watchin me like cable
My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades
Had the Prada shoes on cause the world is a stage
Lah-lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair
The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air
When my eyes connected with somethin' real real nice
Like she finished her drink and started chewin on my ice
Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white
That's when I realized it'll be a long night
The vibe was right, she was laced in all white
Her French manicure traced the crown on my mic
You ever try to focus, resist with all your might
But every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype
(Chorus + (different ad libs))
(Verse Two)
I'm talkin' tan lines, belly rings and things
DJ rubbin my thing, makin' my head swing
All the honies was schemin...
Cause the rocks in my ears was gleamin, oh God I must be dreamin'
My vision was blurry, the party was rockin'
The tools was knockin', honey wanna get it poppin'
Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil
People was walkin' by makin' our drinks filled
What would you do, if you was a Don
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blonde?
Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm
Cause you sippin on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb
You dancin in your seat, and singin' along
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform
The party is packed, it's just a little too warm
But you take another sip to prove that you strong
(Chorus + (different ad libs))
(LL) Take it to the bridge
(Interlude + (LL Cool J))
I can't call it, I can't tell
Honestly, I'm drunk as hell (uh-huh)
And me, I can not believeeeee (lay back baby)
This night out is windin down (uh)
You keep buyin all these rounds for meeeeee (aww man)
I know what you want from me (yeah)
I know what you want
(Chorus - repeat 2X (w/ different ad libs))

Rollin' out with me (uh, roll out)

Hey yo, Marley, man
[ Marley Marl ] Yo, what's up, man?

We was gettin' busy on the album everyday
We been gettin' funky, but
I wanna take this jam back to Farmers
Knowmsayin?
[ Marley Marl ] Yo, let's go back on Farmers
And get some of them early MC's
You used to be kickin it with back in the day?

But first I gotta like introduce it
Youknowmsayin?
[ Marley Marl ] Aight, kick it...
(Farmers Boulevard)
(L.L. Cool J)
Back in the days, before I was Cool J
I used to hang up on the corner, pumpin Games People Play
Sittin' on a garbage can, rhymin to my man
Talkin' bout big money and future plans
I always told the brothers, if I got a contract
When the money started flowin, I'd be back
To do a jam, against all odds
Introducing rapper 1 from Farmers Boulevard
(Bomb)
Hey yo, B-o-m-b, bomb explosion
Attack like a cat when I'm trapped and I'm closed in
Sharp-ass claws, and I break all laws
In a while all jaws, 'cause I'm perfect, no flaws
Now I'm back to Farmers on some new improved
(Sh...) I'm makin' moves, not fakin moves
So don't you never come around here, talkin' that talk
Or walkin' that walk, you'll get played like a sport
Football, soccer, whatever you savour
You're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor
Ha! L'll have you breakin locks
I'll have you cookin fried rice in a big steel box
The type of skills that I got reigned for years
No worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears
'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers
Suckers, I'm drinkin' forties of beers

Hey yo Uncle L, let's go...
[ Cool J ] Yeah man, I wanna check out my man Big Money Grip
Yo, what's up, man
Kick a little somethin'
(Big Money Grip)
Kick out the can and slam
Summertime, C.I.A. step into the jam
Reach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up
And the brothers start fleein like it's a hold-up
Some step aside, but a few play me close
Never worry, cause the brother who cross me's gettin' buried
And the fool who wants to deal with another dose
I see to it in a hour that the mutha is comatose
Farmers Boulevard, the place
Handin me a mic is like givin' a chainsaw to Leatherface
Smokin' MC's in an instant
At my side bustin' caps is T-Boogie, my assistant
Throw that speaker in the trash
Why's that? Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash
Big Money Grip makin' you get up
Farmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up

It's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo

[ Marley Marl ] Hi C over there, man
[ Cool J ] Yo, what's up Hi C...
(Hi C)
Hi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme
More than a line on time, because I'm gettin' mine
Never underestimate the skill of a great one
The Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none
Another funky rapper from around the way
Leavin' bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay
Boy, you been told, put your lips on hold
All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreadin terror on the street like they was in the past
Any punks on the block, yo, never could last
And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag
(One time a sucker got ill and went out in a bodybag)
Fear will erupt through the heart of another
The Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother

It's kinda funky out here
Yo, yo, yo, Hi C
Yo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo

Yo, what's up?

But yo, L
Won't you - won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?
[ Cool J ] Aight, let me sum this up

Now you heard the brothers speakin' 'bout the street that we're from
Rhymes hittin, beats kickin, you can't get none
F-a-r-m-e-r-s passin the test
Marley Marl in the background doin' the rest
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, kato
Get up out my face before I play you like Play-Doh

Yeah
Funky! Uh
Yeah
Yo, let me tell you 'bout a girl named Peg
A D.C. haircut and stewardess legs
Dressed to kill, her physique is ill
Her face belongs on a dollar bill
Her boyfriend's down with the M-O-B
Drivin' around in a 300e
Trunk jewelry and all that
Talkin' bout, ""My man can't fall black!""
Sippin on cham', diamonds on her hand
Takin' cash, carryin drugs for her man
Drivin' around in a kitted up Jetta
Under the seat a automatic beretta
You know, the whole blase blah of rap
Tellin' brothers they need to get off the brastrap
That's the type of girl she is
Word to Miz, she got the
Full length blue fox, knock you out the box
Big rocks, this girl is hype Hobbes
The type of girl that cold did son wrong
She got the face that you wanna spend money on
Her man be smackin her up
Yeah, backin her up
To the wall, get undressed, where you goin'?
You ain't playin' me out with that hoein
Look in the mirror, check the jewels
Silly rabbit, you know the rules
But he had to leave on another deal
So she's out there with sex appeal
It's the weekend, time for freakin, she's sneakin
Outside, tellin' her homegirls, we can
Do the do, with who-ever we want to
'Cause we're the fly girl crew
Not knowin' her man messed up the money
Ridin' around, thinkin' everything's funny
Went in a disco, came outside
Somebody pushed her in a beat up ride
She had to pay for her man's mistakes
They shot her in the head
That's the breaks"
61,Father,1997,Phenomenon (1997),,LL Cool J,"I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,
So help me God
I just felt like telling the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that
If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms 'cause she's talkin' on the phone
Come on
All I ever wanted
(All I ever needed)
All I ever needed
(Was a father)
Was a father
(That's all)
That's all!
(All I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(All I ever needed)
All I ever needed, was a father

Moms got tired of the beatings said, ""Yo, we got to go""
Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'
She said, ""I ain't taking these whippin's no mo'
I want to live to see my little Todd grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Looking down at me standing on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feeling me?
(I'm feeling you)
All I ever wanted

All I ever needed, was a father

My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens
Possessed by a demon, a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me?""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screaming I can't forget that
My grandfather tried to close the do'
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real
All I ever wanted

All I ever needed, was a father
(Was a father)
My head was spinning, I had never seen blood
Four years old, this don't feel like love
Anyway, pops disappeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
Until I started getting beatings everyday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishing the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'
That's just the tip of the iceberg look
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book
Word is bond, that's real baby
All I ever wanted
(All I ever needed)
All I ever needed
(Was a father)
Was a father
(That's all)
That's all!
(All I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(All I ever needed)
All I ever needed, was a father

Uh-huh, eh-heh
Lay back on this one (yeah, you know how I do baby)
You only a customer
When you walkin' in the presence of hust-lers
Uh, I'm laid back in the cinnamon Range
Two decades and ain't a damn thing changed
Keep my girl, in strawberry swirls
You can taste it, my instict's basic
Lord have mercy, sweet like Hershey
Kisses, diamonds for the misses, ices on the wrist-es
All different colors of the spectrum
The smallest flaw and I reject 'em
Believe me I'm a conniseur when I inspect 'em
I baguettes them, invisibly sets them
They call me big L-ly Wonka from Compton to Yonkers
Them Chi-Town steppers and them A-Town stompers
These young rookies, fail to understand
Every summer I return like the ice cream man
Drop what you doin', get-it get-it while you can
By the eighth, by the ounce, when it's gone I'ma bounce
It's the F-L-A-V, no if's or maybe's
You know what I do, drive your tastebuds crazy

Like lemondrops with chocolate kisses
Every bite is more delicious

Like caramel on vanilla sundae
Have a scoop you'll want some day
'Cause you're my favorite flavor
(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon
(LL Cool J)
My flavor's unreal
Smooth but hard like woodgrain on the wheel
Recline your seat baby, enjoy how it feel
Why you crossin your legs, them high heels of eel?
Kick off your shoes, run your toes on the dash
Now peel off your stockings, c'mon let's get it poppin'
I'm in the mood for cotton, candy and I'm plottin
To see you in somethin' silky and see-through
Me too! Man you know how we do
Camcorder main feature, damn a preview
I love how the bottom on your body's EQ
Low but thick though like the base in a six-fo'
So here we go (here we go) we bunny hoppin
I hit the switches baby, you keep it droppin'
It feels marvelous, you in charge of this
I hope you ain't heartless but my guard's now regardless

Is eat you up cause you look so good

(What'chu sayin', want a sprinkle of the hood ha? Ha?)

We had it out
Now tell your girls the truth when they ask what I'm about
The cookies and the cream and the peaches 'n' praline
Butter pecan themes in your daydreams
All real sugar, no sacca-rhine
Low calorie leave no cavities
Guaranteed no place you'd rather be
Than here with me, mix chocolate in the factory

Heartbeat"
64,Feel The Beat,2004,The DEFinition (2004),,LL Cool J,"Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
Freak freak y'all
You don't stop
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
Freak freak y'all
You don't stop
When Def Jam signed me
They hit the lottery
It wasn't free but don't call it a robbery
They underestimated me quite possibly
It's like that when you a godfather B
I'm the greatest of all time
You heard that before
But now when I say it
It means so much more
Cause It's so true
No hype man, No crew
No reason for ghost writers
Every year I get tighter
Mothers and daughters agree I'm on fire
Check ya T-Mobile it's all over the wire
Cross ya legs baby hide ya desire
You think I'm hot
You preaching to the choir
Smiling and giggling
Thirsting like Gilligan
More flavor than cinnamon
They rush with adrenaline
I make 'em nervous
I do it on purpose
I come back hotter
Every time I resurface
Drop to ya knees baby
Praise the king
Now ask Russell Simmons
Who built the west wing
I ain't gotta be cocky
I do the damn thing
Paint ya girl with strawberry frosting
Internationally known and respected
You talk slick I'm too large to be affected
You crank call my cells disconnected
You keep slipping but my games perfected
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
Freak freak y'all
You don't stop
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all

You don't stop

You don't stop
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
Freak freak y'all
You don't stop
I'm a star for real my aura is crazy
Hollywood love me in the streets I'm gravy
Born with a gift to inspire the hood
You wanna out do me and I wish you would
I'm the master separate from all these cats
I'm laughin' in '86 I balled like that
Honey catching feeling from sittin' in Maybachs
Cause her project hall is smelling like Ajax
That's understandable but everybody relax
Hate when folk get money and don't know how to act
I'm a multi millionaire homey that's a fact
But it's not the ice that makes ya wife react
Been had an entourage and platinum cards
Been getting Swedish massage in Boca Raton
What you think all them years I ain't pop no Don
Spend a night in Trump Towers with a blue eyed blonde
I been did it all my Benzes was kitted
When you talk like a baller you tickle me with it
But yeah there's money out there come on let's get it
But I'm a get it in such a way you never forget it
Let's go twenty platinum albums in a row
Sixty thousand fans a three hour show
I could care less who drop and blow
My name is LL baby that's beyond the flow
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
Freak freak y'all

Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all

You don't stop
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
Freak freak y'all
You don't stop
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
Freak freak y'all
You don't stop
These rap cats get upset with me
When security clear out the V.I.P
If honey wanna lounge we gone see ID
Ain't no negotiating you gone pay my fee
I'm the boss I call the shots to keep it hot
I don't have competition I'm bigger than the slot
While you waste advances on grey market rocks
I cop municipal bonds and Wal Mart stocks
A family man but hard as a rock
And I die for my kids so stay off my block
They might be impressed with you but I'm not
After all these years I still walk with a bop
Still keep the ink hot
Still scheme like a fox
Still ready to battle
You don't want your career stopped
Industry shocked 'cause I mapped out a plot
And ran around humble with my joint on cock
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
Freak freak y'all
You don't stop
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all
Freak freak y'all
You don't stop
Uh yes yes y'all feel the beat y'all

I'm the G.O.A.T., what I wrote cause fire and smoke
Think I started on the choir singin' solo for the pope
Tell your mama please, get up off her knees
You can't wear yellow spandex wit a ass like cottage cheese
Open toed shoes, feet smell like collard greens
Toes *Kriss Krossed* like she on J. Dupri's team
Bunyon you're sittin' up like beach balls in the sand plus
A mouth full of rotten teeth with a dildo in her hand
Who the fuck let you in, all my assistants are fired
Now I'm lookin' for some washed up rapper that I can hire
You know some old school nigga wit a bit of attitude
Pay him $1500 to fuck a girl in an interlude
You say I'm souped up, well, soup is good food
So what I scratch my nuts, how the fuck is that rude
For so glowin', afro pickin'
S-curl hatin', Jamaican rum sippin

Kid I'll burp on your girl buttcheeks

'Cause honey had my nuts like two red beets
I'm bananas, out of my fuckin' mind they won't let me back in

Bruno Samartino, Stan Staziak

James Todd Smith and nine years old
When +Sugarhill+ was in control
I'm listenin' to cold-crushed tapes to get sold
I set my demo in a silvia-treated me cold
Time flew 'cause I was gettin' my shit off
Sixteen-now it's about the time to set my first hit off
(""I Need A Beat"") +I Need A Beat+, it was a smash on the DL
But every time I did a show my name was misspelled
+Can't Live Without My Radio+ drops
I'm kickin' down the door-crushed cool box
+Rockin' the bells+ like a madman
Dissin', event-flippin' the script-but then I made my first ?50,000
All I wanted was a pencil, a little gold
A little money in my pocket and a Phillie to roll
I'm makin' records, now alla the girls are on my tip
I'm sleepin' late, no money damn, I'm late for school, SHIT!

I wasn't tryin' to hear it 'cause I'm bad
When I'm alone in my room, I pick up a pen and start to get mad
+I Need Love+, that means I need a girl to love me down
I dropped the pretty style cause rap was gettin' ugly
I waited a year for the results, I'm triple platinum
We know the presidents are flowin' by who's sackin' them
+I'm that type of guy+ when poppa wasn't happy with it
Trippin' them up, that was my style, but everybody bit it
Yo Marley, hit the remix, make it fresh with flavour
Another power move, I'll switch my hat, the shit is major
Puttin' out +Till Da Break Of Dawn+, tell me what sucker?
Cops harass me +Illegal Search+ motherfucker
I'm just a brother makin' jams now I got a name
I still remember chillin' with my pistol on the train
I'm sayin' two to this I'm representin' hip-hop
Admit that I'm the man, its time for me to get my props

+Mama Said To Knock 'Em Out+ I knocked 'em out the box
I got a rhyme to wake, you're sloppin' up and down the blocks
There never was a time when I was down to meetin' by myself
When all the punks on top of everybody else, but
In '92 and '93 I'm makin' history
The largest motherfuckin' street, that ain't no mystery
The baddest rapper ever born, you think I'm crazy?
I heard your albums' kinda warm, that shit don't phase me
I'm too rough, too rugged, now that doesn't sound so easy does it
Thought I was +Going Back To Cali+ where I knew I wasn't
I sent a +Murdergram+, solo in a black van
I'm claimin' knuckle game, stomp you with my Timberland
+Mr. Goodbar+ lickin' all the rough stuff
I'm kickin' down your door with condoms in a rudder-put
You wanna find me come to +Farmers Boulevard+

So I'm makin' big steps like Gladys Knight in the pier
One rhyme you're on my tensils as I leave my lip
Up the block kids are talkin' and spreadin the news
About the new grandmaster the one you'll choose
'Cause I'm chuckling I wanna stomp the rest
When I kick it couldn't bore it could only impress
I'm not a Hula-Hoop this isn't a passin phase
Hard work pays I'm gettin' straight up A's

Wanna be involved, better be aware

Do it on the floor, stairs to the chair
Do it on the beat, please, hands to stare
Got you on the beach, you out somewhere
Got your girl screaming that it ain't that fair
Baby come true, got enough bread
Switch to the truck, nothing more said
Kid don't play, just do clean
That's what it is, when I come from Queens
Do my lean, big black truck
Coming through like I'm moving that stuff

Gotta go, back to the grind
Back to the tracks, back to the rhymes
Burn a little haze, I let my rhyme --"
70,Get da Drop on 'Em,1995,Mr. Smith (1995),,LL Cool J,"Check it out
I break a nigga down ugly like Coke, up on the scale
Next step throw a stack up on the third rail
The undisputed, I'm never ever diluted or polluted
You could fuse it, if ya choose it 'cause it's deep rooted
I make ya maggot ass crawl out tha gutter
For underestimatin as I'm cre-atin the butter
Cliques get clipped like heavy bricks when I'm droppin'
I'm wreckin nigga whole shit plus I make a profit
Wicked with this shout, bodies are fished out
I'm wreckin niggas one-by-one but then I miscount
Mispronounced, how do LL bounce
And get ya shit bust? I turn ya faggots into mush
Ya slippin, I'm grippin microphones real tight
Then I crack up the speakers in ya Ac all night
Deliver messages, the prophecy's in me
His Royal Highness, you minus what you claim to be
(Say what?)
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas
*Repeat x 3*
I blow em, KABOOM, but fuck sound effects
Niggas was sleeping like I was off on a Star Trek
Select my dialect, inspect all my cheques
He claim he gettin' money but L cast the cheque
You sell blunt weed, Glock block, horizons
Niggas in the projects find ya hypnotising
You clowns know when I bring forth the heat
Hardcore niggas be wearin panties, lookin' sweet
I'm on a journey through the land of frontin niggas
Nervous motherfuckers with tha hands on dirty triggers
I lay back, niggas beef or let my nuts live
I take my blade, insert it until ya guts give
Execution, the destroyer of ya suspect bunch
What? Drama! You can't believe how I deliver bomb shit
Ya brains split, the pain hits ya little dick
You fallin' backwards, leanin like a dope addict
Rope niggas claim me, packin automatics
Found his ol' Earth's burner underneath the mattress
Go outside, the bitch up just like a actress
I take ya motherfuckers one-by-one and show ya how it's done
And dick ya down in front of everyone
Bitch niggas ain't got no type of reason
To say a bullshit rhyme in LL season
I'm freezin, ya bleedin heavily up out'cha rectum
Black and blue, tryin' ta hide up in the spectrum
I got ya raw ass bustin' straight flat
Head up on the place mat, ready to waste that
Operatin incorparates stimulatin designs
Lay that motherfucker's shit down, nigga resign
Don't lose ya mind, concentratin on how I shine
You never hear a nigga like me, never in time
I blaze it quick, amaze cliques when I flip
I can't believe you niggas forgot who rip shit
It's '96 and niggas like to hold they dicks
I'm breakin shit aside ya doctor's can't fix
Fuck the tricks and all them smooth singin' grooves
I'm bringin' crews, in my ring you swing and lose
With the blues light my fuse, allow me
To show ya crab ass fake niggas how it be
My technique's superb when I'm pissin on these herbs
Crystal clear so you can hear every word
Fuck the goodie-goodie or your moms might hear it
I gotta keep my title locked down so niggas fear it
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas
I blow it, I make it hot for my niggas
*Repeat x 2*
Uh, I get da drop on you niggas
I blow it, I make it hot!"
71,Give Me Love,2013,Authentic (2013),,LL Cool J,"Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (your heart)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me where you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love
Honestly, I'm afraid to give love
Deep down I'm afraid to be judged
That's why I pull back, don't speak no rap
Put on the beat, man every time we hug
It's deep, I'm afraid of heartbreak so much
The thought alone feels like my soul got cut
The thought alone feels like my soul got cut
My heart's wide open, baby show me mercy
Life is a desert and for love I'm thirsty
You lead me to the water, I'm afraid to drink
You hand me a glass, still don't know what to think
Your love is terrifying, I'm standing on the brink
I'm floating in your eyes then I start to sink
Girl, I never knew that I could feel so weak
Flying on a cloud in-between these sheets
I'm one with myself, why do I retreat?
It's a battle just to try to go to sleep
Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (that's all right)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me when you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love
Give it to me baby (you baby)
Give it to me baby (you baby)
Give it to me baby (yeah)
Give it to me
Just give me your heart
Give it to me baby
Uh baby
Give it to me baby
Uh girl
Give it to me baby
I swear all I need is your love
Everybody knows that falling in love's easy, timing out's hard
So I only wasn't really, raise my thoughts as God
It's crazy, I hold you in the highest regard
But us having true love? What's the odds?
That's scary, what if I get hit that hard
So hard I can't get up, heart got lit up
Too weak to move, can't eat, no sit up
Mommy used to say - don't worry, it's just a hiccup
But even she can't help
When your heart's on fire, about to melt
So everything I really feel, I keep it to myself
So I don't end up hurt like everybody else
Took love off the bat, burn I put it on the shelf
With the books I never read about pain I never felt
Love is a problem, baby I need help
My card's on the table and my heart's breaking me up
Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (I swear)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me when you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love
Give it to me baby (you baby)
Give it to me baby (from you baby)
Give it to me baby (yeah)
Give it to me
Just give me your heart
Give it to me baby
Uh baby
Give it to me baby
Uh girl
Give it to me baby
I swear all I need is your love
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
When the last chapter's done, I hope you're mine
Yeah
(I need you to know)
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
When the last chapter's done, I hope you're mine
But until that try
Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (that's all I need)
Uh baby (Uh baby)
Give me love (oh love)
Tell me when you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love
Give it to me baby (your love)
Give it to me baby (just what I need)
Give it to me baby (your love is just what I need)
Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (your love, your love, your love)
Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (that's what I need)
All I need is your love
Dear diary (dear diary)
I hope she feels the same
I hope she keeps loving me
Keeps loving me as I'm loving
I love er more than ever
I pray our love won't change
Let's go home
Give me love"

9, 10, 11 'o' clock 12 'o' clock ROCK
Gonna ROCK (What?) ROCK, ROCK around the clock
Three years ago in St. Albans, Queens
I was rockin' at a bar called one eighteen
Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot
Didn't know that years later I'll be standin on top
Livin' on Farmers Boulevard I was born at Bayshore
Slap the rich and shake hands with the poor
And this is a story about a brother I know
Cut Creator on the fader no watch him go
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go

Way back in the days before I clocked some dough
I used to go to the show and sit in the front row
Hopin and prayin' one day I'd get on a roll
So I'd have Fila in the summer and a mink when it's cold
Not fearin of course, cockstrong like a horse
No man's runnin' my posse, cause each man is a boss
When his homie can't wait to pull a jam out the crate
One time for your mind
Check out the guitar break
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go, go Cut Creator Go

This jam just wasn't enough for Jimmy Hendrix to sing
He could do lessons of mixin take you under his wing
Straight from the heart cause it ain't the money that we came here for
Ain't enforcin no rules ain't breakin no laws
We ain't a rock 'n' roll band in pinstripe and plaid
Just my posse learned to work for what little they had
It's all about us three: E, Phil and Jay
He heard Cut Creator cut now check it out to play
Go, go Cut Creator Go

Cuts are slicker than Grease needles sharper than knives
We'll be do doin' the doo for the rest of our lives
Wanna piece of the action, it's time to party, get up
Not a subway bummy singer puttin' change in a cup
Wanna see you boogie, oogie jumpin' up and down
Bitin your livin' hold your breath until we come to your town

It's gone be butter, nahmean?
Uh, swerve on em, uh yeah
Crack the Mo, here we go
I'm in the mood to let the chickenheads flow
Son, no doubt, god it's real
Every member of my clique is equipped with steel
Suga, let's (HEESHA!), uh, god bless
Just the type of man that can lace the crowd
Which ya hands on ya [BLANK] or you could raise them proud
I bust shots off
Put my hands on my shorty and I make it hot-ter
I got a lock ya, flavour to bring
Got the championships so I'ma savour the ring
Church boy, raised by my grandmomma
Home-bred, I dead all the drama
I'm like the mystical funk technician
It's a sign of the times, guards on a mission
God bless ya lover, god bless you [x4]
Have mercy!
Nowadays I got them other niggas acting thirsty
Bless the sky, energy created by my third child
Swerve wit it, get it get it
Feels good to bust shots at the critics
You crave more taste of my funk
When my track drop ain't enough space in ya trunk
Soul for real, but not the group
I'm solo goin' for dolo in the drop Coupe
I distribute melodies while ya gold trees
Step a dip like a flip, '96 kis
Matter fact take it to the bridge
God bless
God bless ya lover
(Repeat)
Honey dippin off my Nautica sleeves
With them Gortex boots, that compliment all the cheese
Shouldn't hate me 'cause I'm raw
(I thought you fell off kid!) You said that shit before
But you see miracles when you're lyrical
Off some LL shit, chickens get hysterical
'Cause I... form like Voltron
Let's get it on and take ya chime bomb [explosion]
Knock it off
I like your style but it's a slight bit soft
Son, the LL rule, huh
I pick it up and lay it down mad cool
It'll cost you a fortune (What?)
For me to make it hot, heat it up and keep it scorchin

74,Going Back to Cali,1989,Walking With A Panther (1989),,LL Cool J,"I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali hmm, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, I don't think so
Going back to Cali, styling, profiling
Growling, and smiling, while in the sun
The top is down, on the black Corvette
And it's fly, cause it's sitting on Dayton's
Laurents steering wheel, plushed out, gold-leaf phantom top
And three girls waiting
Vroom engine's blowing, the chrome, is shining
Passing all the cars on the way
Movement of the wind, back wheels spin
Pop in a cassette and push play
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, yea y'all, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali
I'm going back to Cali, shaking 'em, baking 'em
Takin' 'em to spots they never before hung
The place, on Sunset it's a trip
Where the A.C.'s cold, and the girls still strip
The record skip, but this girl kept dancing
Prancing, grinding, grinning, romancing
I asked her to the barn, so we could hit the hay
I want to do this, Brutus, but I don't want to pay
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, no man I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali
I'm going back to Cali, rising, surprising
Advising, realizing, she's sizing me up
Her bikini, small; heels, tall
She said, she liked, the ocean
She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast, but this girl was faster
She's looking for a real good time
I said, ""Close your eyes, I got a surprise, ""
And I ran away with the bottle of wine
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali, I don't think so"

Hello, hello (yo, yo) {*repeat 6X*}
Call me on the telephone...
(LL Cool J)
Whether, 2-1-2, or 7-1-8
Or 9-1-4, I love it hardcore
When it's over the phone, it's safe to do it raw
Imaginary worlds we could both explore
(Hello) Baby what you wearin right now?
(Hot pants) My girl ain't around, let's get down
And I hope the phone's tapped, let's pretend you on my lap
(I'm bouncin' up and down with my shoulders back)
(Nigga you like that?) You see I'm runnin' up my bill
Momma might hear me, but you just too ill
I got your flicks lined up, stereo low
Cherry flavored grease beneath my elbow
If I was there what would you do? (I'd lay you on your back)
(Ride or die daddy, and I love it like that)
(LL Cool J)
You the freak of my dreams, the reason that I keep on baggy jeans
(Ooh, I love me a nigga from killer Queens)
(I'ma rub up on your muscles, ride till I'm sweatin it)
(I bet you I can make you cum first) Throw the bets in
I'm a nasty nigga, made to order
Kiss below the border with a warm glass of water
Is you wit me? (Yeah) Tell me how it taste
I promise I'll keep the telephone right in my face
How it feel? (Feels good) Where you at? (In the hood)
(Talkin' on the phone like a good girl should)
(To my nig', baby I'ma reach my peak)
Strawberry shortcake, good enough to eat
(And I taste mad sweet) We big freaks
Blastin off on the phone seven days a week
(LL Cool J)
I throw sugar in the water so the ice tastes sweet
To make sure your ex-man can't compete
Shower curtain on the bed, warm baby oil
G-string sittin' like a snake in a coil
(Hold on, I think somebody on the other line)
Interrupt this nut I'ma bust, you out your mind
Lay back, imagine us chest to chest
Tongue-kissin' deep while we spark a sess
(Everything is crazy, L do it the best)
Ridin' rough baby, put my pipe to the test
(On the telephone?) Yeah, this is the ill zone
I wanna make you moan until it's a dial tone (*BOOOOO*)
However you want it baby, I'm raw to the bone
Three (three) two (two) one (one) telephone

77,Hey Lover,1995,Mr. Smith (1995),,LL Cool J,"I've been watchin' you from afar,
For as long as I can remember.
You're all a real man can need,
And ever asked for
This is love girl.
This is more than a crush, yeah.
It was Harlem at the Ruckers
I saw ya witcha man
Smiling, huh, a coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the Coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So I skated off, as you strolled off
Looking at the legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If this love is real, he's got to handle competition
You only knew him 5 months (that's right)
Besides he drink too much, and smoke too many blunts
And I be working out everyday thinking 'bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years, hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)
I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
And I don't wanna violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still he can't stop me from having day dreams
Tounging you down with, huh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs under the moonlight
Searching your body with my tongue girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the isle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you'd follow I'll lead
Hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becomin my wife no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love we both fell
Swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control
But it's a fantasy it won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)"
78,Hip Hop,1995,Mr. Smith (1995),,LL Cool J,"Word up! Y'knowhutI'msayin?
I gotta globe in the world in the mail today
NahI'msayin? Heh, word up!
Uh, kid told me ""Yo, the world is yours kid, put it in ya pocket""
Nahmean?
Make a brother feel good, word up!
Brother feel energised
I wanna dedicate this one to the game that put me on the map
Y'nahI'msayin?
I know you love it, the game is so irresistible to touch
You should see me when fienin for microphones that I can clutch
Droppin' bombs, combinin the club attracts
Like the Ol' Sugarhill Gang, King Tim and Fatback
There's no question the suggestion was made
The foundation was laid when the Furious played
Grandmaster Flash slayed the competition that was wishin
They could serve the technician with the number one position
Uh, the real deal, Fearless Four scored
Bambataa was hotter, Spoony was givin' 'em nutta
An' I was all up in my headzone, melody and all
Cosign and The Movement sayin' ""Yes, yes y'all""
It's just the love affair that never ended
I recommended that I take microphones and blow 'em up, ain't that splendid
This one goes out to all the hip-hop do-or-diers
A song is dedicated to the music I admire
Whenever and ever
We want you, I need you (I need hip-hop)
Whenever and ever
We want you, do you feel the same way too? (I need hip-hop)
Kane's era was terror, he warmed it up
Parrish and Erick cat lyrics that'll make ya turn it up
And I was in the cut, chillin' in my drop-top Benz
With friends, loungin with my mens, laughin' 'bout all the ends
That I spends, making snaps, pumping Kool G Rap and Biz
Dapper Don, Dookie wrotes I'm about to show what time it is
At the rooftop, I was with Doug E.Fresh and Slick Rick
'La Di Da Di, Who likes to party?' was the fat shit
I mean I saw this hip-hop thing on every level
Chuck D, PE, yes the rhythm and the rebel
I can reminisce the black fist, Uzi, Terminators
Terror doom techniques that terrorise the lighter shade
It's all about the game that we play everyday
Eric B & Rakim flow to such a diff'rent way
I'm lovin' hip-hop 'cause it help brothers escape
Let's celebrate our music people before it's too late
Survival Of The Fittest-Mobb Deep, and Lost Boyz
Lickin' shots got the game hot
They even flipped on 2PAC
Snoop Doggy Dogg put the West Coast in gear
Dr Dre, NWA, Eazy E's in here
I wanna tell the world they just don't understand
My man Nas Escobar, Wu-Tang Clan
Keith Murray to the Redman, down south Da Brat
My people are you with me where you at?...ya peep that?
I'm on a mission to rejuvenate the funk
Bring the game back and give the do-or-diers what they want
When you hear Craig Mack, Notorious B.I.G.
Latifah, Heavy D, you should reminisce of me
Some say it's Naughty By Nature-'hip-hop in all its glory'
A fleet of battleships floatin in diff'rent categories
My love affair with hip-hop'll never fade away
Sincerely yours, LL Cool J
(Chorus to fade)
(Outro: (over chorus))
Yeah, ain't no doubt about it kid, knowI'msayin?
Hip-hop's the game, helped a lot of brothers escape
Take it to another level, knowI'msayin?
It's our music, we own this music, knowhutI'msayin?
Word life! I wanna give a couple of shoutouts here, knowhutI'msayin?
First of all, I wanna thank my man Baby Chris, y'nahmean?
Helped me put this Mr. Smith... Mr.Smith album together
Make it hot, knowI'msayin?

You know how I mean, so I figured you know what I'm sayin'
I'd just make a little movie, with a chick involved.
Check it
If you saw the movie Wall Street I guess you know
The way ya stack chips and regulate wild dough
But ain't no G-funk and far from my era
Tales from the hood your boyz will feel terror
MC's contaminatin' tracks with feces
You think of pussy until a flick like Species
Hi tech ya my pen got velocity
Jumpin' out the SSL like Virtuosity
And never question what I'm doin' to ya girl
She let me dive deep like her panties is Waterworld
But all metaphors the only thing in rap
You brothers need to stop with that
I'm goin' from
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Check it,
I'm makin' Speed like I'm Keanu Reeves
But too many True Lies can make a honey please
She said, I know you want this
Ghetto Pocahontas
I got Higher Learnin'
And bangin' gets monotonous
Her ass is classic
Cheeks was Jurrasic
Servin' a Justice
Poetic the way I last it
I touch ground real windy with my lyrics
Make her talk in tongues and feel the Holy Spirit
Hear it, pulling light strings
Got mad cast a swing
When I do my thing my ballz is hairy like the Lion King
I'm in the jungle layin' down my mack
You brothers need to chill with that
I'm goin' from
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Take me away
You think I won't fool
Take me away
You think I can't fool
Take me away
You think I won't fool
Take me away
You think I can't fool
It's kinda like miniture satellites floatin' in closets
Spyin' in pockets
Jumpin' out of a helicopter into a football stadium filled with cotton candy
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Word up,
So your man got a good job lovin' ya so much
Boss on his back comin' home like 'What the fuck?'
But you be on his side through the thick and all the thin
That's when LL come in
Blast a ass like Apollo 13
Sugar get the cream
Hoppin dom in every direction
What a scene
He can't understand, your best friend's plan
Running game while you chill with the Demolition Man
Good love, have fun, tight hugs, and flowers
I have your girl runnin' off to fake baby showers
Better get down before ya cryin' at home
I got her standing on the bed gettin' closer to the Drop Zone
Some brother's won't appreciate that
Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack
Let's run it back
See the flavors in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me
Balls a lethal weapon, dick a menace to society
You ain't a player hater kid you took her off restriction
I make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction
Kid you know I'm game tight, when you hit it tonight
I hope she screams my name right
This word is born kid, you know why?
I'm goin' from
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good
Check it."

(Radio transmission)
""I got a 187 on the corner of Farmers boulevard in Linden.""
""Uh, drug related?""
""The usual.""
I don't mean this in a disrespectful way
But Columbine happens in the ghetto every day
When the shit goes down y'all ain't got nothing to say
He kicked the old lady's door in, threw her on the floor
Choked her to death so she don't scream no more
He need some white chocolate, he feel it in his bones
He heard she refinanced and got a bank loan
He used to mow the lawn, take the garbage out
Now she in the closet wit a sock in her mouth
Copped a chain, copped some crills
Crack pipe in his windpipe, twistin like a drill
Run around frontin, buyin his mens kicks
Gassed a broad up so she can help her rent a whip
The other killer peeped him out flashin a knot
A well known murderer, check the ill plot
Call up Corey Buns, get him on the block
Niggas gotta eat, plus he front alot
He came through, straight strip search
He said I'm comin' back, and I'ma put in work
Niggas told him, ayo leave that shit alone
But pride mixed with crack, had him in a zone
Prepared for more shit than Depends
Eyes bloodshot through a Cardier lens
Niggas said Buns came through lookin' strange
Yeah, Buns won't stay in his lane
Aight, Buns want ghetto fame
And caught two in the Ukraine at point blank range
It's a, Homicide, just a Homicide [8X]
I don't mean this in a disrespectful way
But Columbine happens in the ghetto every day
When the shit goes down y'all ain't got nothing to say
Jamaician cat, real treacherous
Used to smuggle burners up from Texas
Had the ill crib out in Rosedale
Took the money from the trunk and copped a fishscale
Chinese Jamacian, real pretty nigga
Love puffin blunts, throwin' bodies in the river
One of the illest niggas that the world ever saw
Used to take loaded nines and throw 'em on the floor
He was from Brooklyn, and I don't know the block
I met him at the flicks he commented on my rocks
We rolled back to back, while I was slingin raps
He was slingin crack, I was seventeen fascinated by the stacks
Runnin' with dangerous niggas and packin gats
Uh, the shit thrill me, lookin' so clean, and livin' so filthy
I heard his right hand man disappeared
They found his bike in the street somewhere
Conspiracy theories, niggas talkin' shit
Small world, I was close to his right hand man's chick
She kept beepin him he never called back
When they found him in the trunk his body was jet black
Pretty Jamacian kept doin' his thing
Him and his older brother got caught up in a sting
Out on bail, pressure by the feds, he caught seven in the head
What goes around, comes back around
Nigga rest in peace when they lay ya down

""Uh, central, your assistance is requested we have a major crisis here
Mrs. Winthrop's cat is stuck in a tree.""
""Roger, a squad car is on the way.""

I don't mean this in a disrespectful way
But Columbine happens in the ghetto every day
When this shit goes down y'all ain't got nothing to say
(Radio transmission)
""Central, the cat has been rescued.""
In the ghetto black men are dying at alarming rates
Walkin' the street is like entering a sweepstakes
You never know if you gon win or lose
We walk around feelin' confused and totally abused
Can't front, I'ma millionaire livin' like a king
Still feenin for that shrimp, fried rice and chicken wings
Still feenin for the vibe, only the ghetto bring
Pumpin songs of pain only real niggas sing
Queens finest, but there's one minus
The bodies on the battlefield that got left behind us
I'm sick and tired of going to wakes
'Cause niggas never look the same in the casket
It's bugged out, they skin look like plastic
I shed tears, but use shades to mask it
""Mr. Media"", where was you at when my man died
When it was classified a drug related homicide
It's like until the killer hit the suburbs
I ain't hear nothing, not a word
""Mr. Media"", help us shed light on these homicides
Not just Columbine, but all the time
It's a, Homicide, just a Homicide [8X]"
81,"Hot, Hot, Hot",1997,Phenomenon (1997),,LL Cool J,"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah yeah yeah
Uh, uh, uh
I was swerving through Queens
Fully growin' benz
Searching for the butta through my cartier lense system
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec
Rappin' to my mens
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly
My ?? is
The smo mo, crept up nice and slow
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice
Crease my scar piece
Laid back in my seat
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne
She lived on the southside, so bring things on
Honey got flavour, and it just don't stop
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks
Your carmake me hot hot hot
You just make me just hot hot hot
Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check this out, uh
She slid up my whip, like the queen of New York
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde
Scooby dooby hizza
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh
I've got her right where I want her
Reality about to creep up on her
Stroke her softly, gently with my G
While the light reflects off my i-c-e
Waiter, ice the crystal, let it simmer
Lights to bright, here's a grand make them dimmer
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop
I don't mind spending paper when it's looking that hot
Your car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me just hot hot hot
I Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy just don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'll take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check yourself, uh
You burst out of semi-???
She pulled down the staps to her dress
Reached in the product sparked up sess
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the ??
She said ""Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips,
And give up girl to push whips?""
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone
She said ""I would do anthing for ?????
Give deep ? to ? man coats
Take off my G's
Drop to my knees""
Talking in my face
Breath smelling like cheese
I asked her
Shorty you degrade yourself
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf
You turnin' me off, I can't lie
Keisha said ""why?""
I said, ""yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid,
Then he correct that""
Ice is the price for an overnight wife
A true shark caller don't want that in his life
So all you ladies that are selling your souls
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold
Ask for Keisha, she working on the stroll,
Dead ass broke, but her pimp the man grow
Your car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me hot hot hot
I Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop

82,How I'm Comin',1993,14 Shots To The Dome (1993),,LL Cool J,"Boom bash, wake up, I set it off right
Look around and turn your wet dream to fright night
You can call me r&b homeys, which stands for rough brother
Word to my grandmother
I buck you in the head just to let ya know
Stick you for ya dough, spit on the flo'
Drag it out of ya, bring it on
I smack him back down, yo dope word is bond
I know you want a piece of the champ
But you roll too weak, you couldn't make it in my camp
You thought I went for the flip
But I'm bustin' off hip-hop clip after clip
I kept you out there, ripped you for your wear
Jump inside your video, bust you with a chair
Smack slap smack slap smack slap smack
Just to make it worse and hurt your pride I'll run it back
Smack slap smack slap smack slap smack
Click click boom, stop dead in your tracks
Stick the steel in your mouth
Buck buck buck buck buck, lights out
(I'm comin')
How ya comin' baby?
(I'm comin')
This is how I'm comin'
The album that I'm comin' with is rough, the flavor's mean
(Ooh) kickin' you for real in the guillatine
Fourteen shots to your dome kid
I'm doin' time in the game like a bid
Movin' rhymes like a package
So stigetty step up and get your nostrils damaged
Shootin', lickin', bustin', sprayin', all of that
And then some, dead dead dead, one by one
Never step to a real man
'Cause your rhymes only work on a playground program
They impress your little friends, bring you a little ends
But you still you gotta ride in your man's benz
Word to hip-hop, I'm a blast ya
Gotta set you on fire 'cause I gassed ya
Boom, blow, Batman, bang, pow
Unh (what) unh (what), that's the way it's goin' down
My new album ain't no joke
You wanna take me out, how many bunch ya smoke?
I'll never slack again, I'm off the job like the mob
Hey, no prob', many solved, on the knob, make 'em soft drob
What you gotta deal with is real, made of steel
You can feel it comin', burnin', buildin', flowin' like an eel
Movin', killin', breakin', servin' you just like a meal
Take off your clothes and taste the steel
Check baby
Rockabye baby on the roof top
Open up your mouth and taste my gallot
When your jaw breaks your gold teeth will fall
Down will come the monkey, bannana clip and all
Splat (buck buck buck) it's all over wit'
Another plan O.D.'ed over my war hit
The way I'm workin' and jerkin' and hurtin' brothers converted
Non-believers get murdered, 'cause I waffle birded
Get your face out the bill, catch the thrill
Carry a nine put your hootchies on the bill
The thought of you gettin' scared turns me on
Like my first telivision with my backup tip hard
So where's your mouth kid? where's your heart shorty?
It's all over, cash your chips in, crack a forty
You look thirsty, you ain't gettin' no mercy mercy
And ain't no way that you can rehearse for me
Murder I wrote, murder I wrote, is what I figure
It's in my tote, it's in my tote, so I pull the trigger
Put up your women, your crib, your speakers
Your dog, your cat, your crate, your speakers
Your sister, your aunt, your crew, your Knicks
Got 'em booin' all you mother rappers who think that's too tough
Bam bam, here's a hit you wish you had
A hit that makes you mad, a hit that makes you slap your dad
Dead dead dead, kill dead, kill dead
Try to battle me I gots to buck you in your head
I pull your file, click
I know you're good to style, blow
Livin' wild, when it's come to this I never smile
What did you learn from the lesson I just gave ya?
Obey your momma, be on your best behavior
It's never endin' and I am recommendin'
You put your name as Brendan
I see y'all that is blendin'
The message that I'm sendin'
Is there ain't no pretendin'
Get in the trunk, buy the album, here I'm endin'
This is how I'm comin'
How ya comin' baby?"
83,Hush,2004,The DEFinition (2004),,LL Cool J,"Hush baby, wanna let you know
This is how it's gonna go
Hush baby, wanna let you know
This is how it's gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much
Just wanna feel your touch
Everything will be okay
If you do it my way (my way, my way)
Hush baby
You feel so good
Rest of my life, I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood
Mild-mannered or up to no good
It really doesn't matter, either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold you close
Jump in the drop spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in your mind
Runnin' out of time
Drama of all kind
But there's faith in our mind
We spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin' too fast, the whole world's in a rush
Everybody just hush
Hush baby, wanna let you know
This is how it's gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much
Just wanna feel your touch
Everything will be okay
If you do it my way (my way, my way)
Hush baby
It's all a test, the pain, the drama
The villa in the Bahamas
The highs, the lows
The hoop-t, the Rolls
The money flowin'
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet, the hands that we shake
Whether it's Morton's or Sizzler steak
But everything will be okay
If we do it my way (my way, my way)
'Cause I believe in romance
Kissin' while you slow dance
Me bouncin' baby? No chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes girl, I'll swim to France
Cause your beauty's unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love, forever we are attached
Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach
Hush baby, wanna let you know
This is how it's gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much
Just wanna feel your touch
Everything will be okay
If you do it my way (my way, my way)
Hush baby
I can feel your pain
Like we Siamese twins, connected by our brains
Walkin' through the desert in the ice cold rain
Want you in my life and nothing's gonna change
God willin', we still be doin' our thing
When my six-pack's faded
Raps outdated
But that's many years from now, so don't rush
Little mama, just hush
Hush baby, wanna let you know
This is how it's gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much
Just wanna feel your touch
Everything will be okay
If you do it my way (my way, my way)
Hush baby
Hush baby
Hush, hush darling
Hush baby, hush, hush
Don't talk so much
Wanna feel your touch
Hush baby, hush
Hush baby, hush
Hush baby, wanna let you know"
84,I Can Give You More,1985,Radio (1985),,LL Cool J,"I seen this girl, walkin' down the block
I said, ""WAIT!""
""Yo baby, you wanna come to my crib?""
""Have some donuts and milk?""
""Listen to a pop tune maybe?""
Please be his ex and be my bride
Don't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried
Love you claimed to share just wasn't there
You're too good for that, and it wasn't fair
Love's taken its toll, your heart he stole
You was fooled by the face of a phoney role
But I'll take up the slack, support you, baby
Now the knight in shiny armor can only be me
I cry out your name as you hold his hand
If you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned
I'm lookin' out the window at the stormy rain
And the rush of the water makes my eyes drain
All alone in the room, and it's makin' me sad
Fantasize of the love we could have had
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more
I pour wine for two, even though it's just me
I tried to reach you, but blind men don't see
Your man is the devil, but he gave you a ring
So you believe you saw an innocent angel sing
You're the type that ignores the destiny of two
It's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you
You're bein handicapped by a Don Juan rap
You can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more
Yes girl, I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more
The time has come, the decision's yours
This super love story ain't workin no more
Can't you understand that my love spans
Higher and further than any man's
You're lookin' a gift horse right in the mouth
This time hear me out, I don't care if you pout
You're my only desire, I fight to the death
And I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath
Ain't gettin' on my knees, but I'm oh so close
To our love I toast, all he does is boast
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more
A knock on the door and a tap on the glass
Tells me you see it my way at last
You used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me
He called you up and said, ""Yo baby, why you diss me?""
Meanwhile made romance on the sea shore
You want more of what you used to ignore
During this love affair, girl, it gets steamy
Three nights in a row, and you still wanna see me
Make love at night, coffee in the morn'
I be the only blanket that's keepin' you warm
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more
I hoot in the morning to the crack of sunlight
But my agony continues till it reaches night
Sweet image of your face appears on the wall
And the scene is so eerie I run through the hall
I look at the sky, then I search for the moon
Realize it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon
So I dress to impress, exit the house
Go up to the school and watch the kids come out
In the middle of the court yard there you stand
With the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more
You're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction
You won't get used if you follow my instructions
Your scram my hand, feel the sweat on my palm
Make love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan
And that'll be eroticism, highs die down
You will find your best friend finally is found
I caress ya at night like a virgin in white
Cause the new world I found is oh so tight
And tender and young, soft and wet
It's hotter than any fantasy could get
'Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more"
85,I Can't Live Without My Radio,1985,Radio (1985),,LL Cool J,"My radio, believe me, I like it loud
I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
I'm sorry if you can't understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Don't mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past 10
My story is rough, my neighbourhood is tough
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show
But I couldn't survive without my radio
Terrorising my neighbours with the heavy bass
I keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face
My radio's bad from the Boulevard
I'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd
Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind
'Cause I play everyday, even on the subway
I woulda got a summons but I ran away
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
Suckas on my jock when I walk down the block
I really don't care if you're jealous or not
'Cause I make the songs, you sing along
And your radio's def when my record's on
So get off the wall, become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm
The floor vibrates, the walls cave in
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin
Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac
'Cause I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed
And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes
My stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast
The level on my power meter will not decrease
Suckas get mad, 'cause the girlies scream
And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio
Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck
'Cause the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play
I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J
Let your big butt bounce from right to left
'Cause it's a actual fact this jam is def
Most definitely created by me
Goin' down in radio history
I'm good to go on your radio
And I'm cold gettin' paid 'cause Rick said so
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis
But it's nothin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'
And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'
My name is Cool J, I'm from the rock
Circulating through your radio non-stop
I'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette
And now I'm on the right, standing on the eject
Wearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lotta gold
And jams like these keep me in control
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio
Your energy level starts to increase
As my big beat is slowly released
I'm on the radio and at the jam
LL Cool J is who I am
Imma make ya dance, boogie down and rock
And you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot
And to expand my musical plan
Cut Creator, rock the beat with your hands
That's right, so don't try to front the move
As you become motivated by the funky groove
You can see me and Earl chillin' on the block
With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock
See people can't stop me, neither can the police
I'm a musical maniac to say the least
For you and your radio I made this for
Cool J's here to devastate once more
Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs
If ya try to disrespect me, I just say Please!
Here to command the hip-hop land
Kick it live with a box inside my hand
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
Farmers Boulevard, yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out, cool
Out, you know what I'm sayin'? That's where the crib's at."
86,I Fall in Love,2008,Exit 13 (2008),,LL Cool J,"(LL Cool J)
Uh, uh
Girl when I watch you it's like a dream
You look like you stepped out a magazine
I feel like an addict, you make me fiend
As if you were dancin on a triple beam
I watch your body move back and forth
That's the shit that make Strahan want a divorce
The move is such a seductive way
I feel like Reg in the bush with Kincaid
Never seen a girl in the world
That moves her body, like you do
Have to party, invitin you
Wish I could spend my whole life with you
If that's too much just a night with you
Kick back and turn off the lights with you
As long as it's, exciting you
Whatever it is, I like it too
(Chorus: LL Cool J (Elan))
When I look in your eyes, I fall in love
Girl every time I look at your thighs, I fall in love
You're number one - tell all the guys I fell in love
You make me feel like I won a prize, I'm so in love
That good good love (I'm gonna make you love me)
(I'm gonna make you love me)
(I'm gonna make you love me)
(Love me, loooooove) Stop playin' girl
(LL Cool J)
If I'm victim of circumstance
It's because you're killin' me when you dance
I jump right out of that ambulance
Like B.I.G. I want ""One More Chance""
I got questions, you got the answers
Your body is a {?} but you have to master
I'm not your slave but I'm willin' to play
I'll search for oil, start drillin away
Turn off your iPhone, we chillin' and hey
We'll be sippin Patron, couple gallons a day
Let's take our clothes off, bombs away
Pick a song, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo or Ray J
To get you in the mood, now you ready to play
Come to my house, put your clothes away
There's no commitment, you don't have to stay
Just come with me, I'll set you free
(Interlude: LL Cool J)
What can I do?!
I'm in love with you!
What can I do?!
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU! (Stop playin' girl)
The more I look at you, the more I get
Hypnotized, my nature rise
Before your eyes, I know you're sick
Of all the lies and alibis
From other guys, when I'm watchin you
I get energized, I realize
We need surprise, variety
Is the spice of life, so I eat you up
Like apple pie, I like your flow
You're the star, this is your show
Speed it up, take it slow
Push it out, take it low
That helps a love like this to grow
If you're feelin' me girl let me know
I know that you are respectable
But this type of healin is sexual
(Chorus + Interlude)"
87,I Need Love,1987,Bigger And Deffer (1987),,LL Cool J,"When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life I see I need love
There I was, giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no-names
Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself ""Look what you've done to her""
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Sayin' amour kissing you on the ear
Whispering I love you and I'll always be here
Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
One half of me deserve to be this way till I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
I need love
Romance, sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ""Ooh girl, you're so sweet""
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever tellin' you what I do
But where you at, you're neither here nor there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Sure you ain't in my closet or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen
Take a chance with my love you'll find out what I mean
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide
When I find you I'm a pour all my love inside
I need love
I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold you, just love you
Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me You're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad
I got money, but love is something I never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall
I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug, we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ectasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream-land I can't lie, I've never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget
I need love
See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
A playboy on the run I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch
Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally found you, watch our love unfurl
I need love
LL Talking:
Girl, listen to me
When I be sitting in my room all alone
Staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind and I've come to realize
That I need true love and if you wanna give it to me girl
Make yourself seen I'll be waiting
I love you"
88,I Need a Beat,1985,Radio (1985),,LL Cool J,"If it's a Malibu beat, subject of discussion
Malibu beat, subject of discuss-cussion
You're motivated-vated, to aid a percussion-cussion
There's no glo-glory, for this story-story
It-it rock-rock in any territory-tory
I syncopate it and design it well-well
Beat elevates-vates, the scratch excels-cels
All techniques are a combination
Of skills that I have, thought narration
Last year my melody, but still complete
Providing musical energy for the street
Lyrics are smooth for maximum effect
Jump track patt-erns on cass-ette
Time-time snare had bass and cymbal
Like that of a cat on the mic I'm nimble
Ba-sic patterns, grouped and changed
Se-quence fre-quent, seek and gain...
Break... break... for narration
Break two... break two...
I'm in the center of a - I'm in the center of a
Musical skinner; some say the skins is a blow of torture
They hear me, they fear me, they hear me, they fear me
I'm improvin the conditions of the rap industry
The beat will expand, to land on foreign lands
Germany, Italy, France and Japan, it'll
Give you a lift, no need to sniff
No butts no how's no why's or if's
It's you I defeated, they'll say you retreated
Pick up your favorite magazine and read it
Wrapped by a power, a musical shower-shower
A picture-picture of me-of me on the Eiffel-Eiffel Tower-Tower
I need a beat-beat...
Doing-doing dirty, I'm your-your thought
You're bein-bein taken-taken, the musical boom
I'm in full trating your eardrums
Increasing the rate of vibration
I wanna rock ya-rock ya, that's all you need to know-know
I need a beat, is the title of the show-show
Providing-providing pleasure on the musical measures
All-all arranged, to alleviate pressure
I'm up on your list, your party thera-therapist
Beat programmer and lyri-lyricist
Ladies Love Cool James, studio user
A million or more screamin people abuser
I predict, this jam will hit
The highest plateau in the world of music
Paparazzi, wealth and fame
The total propulsion, of my name
I need a beat...
Computer wise, and the engineer's eyes
Have to be very acute, education level high
The product is mine, beat on the rhyme
The control was part of the studio design
Track after track, culminating on wax
The tape has slack, rewind then back
Expensive but useful, the music is the fuel
A perfect place for MC's to duel...
I need a beat... Farmer's Boulevard...

Silence, shhhh, very deadly
Come and battle, let me add you to my medley

Go get it now, why you always dwellin on the past?
Baby boys reminiscin old school shit
Young fools get dicked, LL rules the shit
With a platinum fist, the relentless abyss
I take you to a land where piranhas like to kiss

Chuckin the colour outta cartoon character

Yeah, (hah, hah, hah, hah) L.O.D.
Keith Murray, Def Squad
Mista, Mista, Mista, Mista Smith
You wanna hit? (You wanna hit?)
Uh, gimme an hour plus a pen and a pad
Yo... I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
And let my balls hang like I'm on a toilet takin' a shit
My style is all that, and a big bag of chips wit the dip
Fuck all that sensuous shit
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your click holier than the Ten Commandments
Like Redman I shift with tha ruck
If ya if was a spliff we'd be all fucked up [Word up!]
No need to ask you who is he, Son I get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard of many ruff cities [Chicago, LA, any of them]
I'll have to Norman Bate ya I love ta hate ya
Cause youse a freak by nature
Can't wait to face ya, mutilate ya
Drink your style down straight wit no chaser [Word up!]
My verbal combat's like a mini-Mac to your back
As soon as one of you niggaz try to over react [BLAOW!]
Tha L.O.D. love good confrontation or vamp [Word up!]
Break your concentration, murder your camp
For tha jealous, overzealous, we fellaz
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis
Niggaz comin' through and actin' wild
Y'all commercial niggaz better have a Coke and a smile
I shot ya!
Verse Two: Prodigy
Yo, I conversate wit many men, it's time to begin again
Forgot what I already knew, aiyyo you hear me friend?
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body
Secret society, tryin' to keep they eye on me
But I'm stay incogni', in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically, the G.O.D.
It's sorta similar but iller than a chess player
I use my thinker, it coincides with my blinker
While you wondered what we sayin' on the records real
Yeah you motherfuckin right kid you know the deal
My Mobb is Infamous just like the fuckin' title read
You get back slapped so hard make ya nose bleed
Some ---- kids feeling guilty 'bout the ----
But you first baby girl so just face it (awright)
But anyway, back on the real side of things
My niggaz sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing (kid)
Everything is real not just a song that we sing (word up, it's real)
From my life to the paper (what), very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will S-H-I-N-E (shine baby, just shine)
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me
Without acknowledgin this man as G-O-D
I shot ya faggot ass
Verse Three: Fat Joe
Now who the fuck you think you talkin' to, I pay dues I spray crews
Look I'm Joey Crack, motherfuckers be like he's bad news
Runnin' this racket, from New York to Montego
Slaughterin people, bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
I'd rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitch ass niggaz know we stronger
Than these weaklings, seekin', for respect that ain't there
Knuckleheads beware, there's mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun, shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulance, this man's wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razor, which I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spatter, at any ad out, that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Now that the fact that somebody's gettin' lucci that's not caucasian
Bullets be blazin' through these streets filled with torture [what the deal pop]
Joey Crack, a.k.a. Kaiser Ceaser
Verse Four: Foxxy Brown
Thug niggaz give they minks to chinks
To' down we sip drinks rockin' minks, flashin rings and things [what the deal]
Frontin hardcore deep inside the Jeep, mackin
Doin' my thing fly nigga you a Scarface king
Bitches grab ya ta-ta's, get them niggaz for they chedda
Fuck it, Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers
Flossin rocks like the size of Fort Knox
Four carats, the ice rocks, pussy bangin' like Versace locs pops [what the deal]
Want ta the creep, on the light raw ass cheeks
I'm sexin raw dog without protection, diseaese infested
Uh, Italiano got the Lucciano
I gets down fuckin' with Brown Fox extra keys to the drop
Boo I'm Jingling Baby, I got crazy Dominicans who pay me
To lay low, I play slow
Roll with tha Firm, Mafiaso crime king pin
It all real nigga what tha deal
I shot ya!
Verse Five: LL Cool J
What the fuck? I thought I conquered the whole world
Crushed Moe Dee, Hammer, and Ice-T's girl
But still, niggaz want to instigate shit
I'll battle any nigga in tha rap game quick
Name the spot, I make it hot for ya bitches
Female rappers too, I don't give a fuck boo
Word, I'm here to crush all my peers
Rhymes of the month in The Source for twenty years
Niggaz scared, I'm detrimental to your mental state
I use my presidential Rolex to be debate
Niggaz fight, glock cocked ya temple gets fucked
MC's, that fuck with LL they gets bucked
That's real, what's up with that I Shot Ya deal?
Light shit, niggaz slip now how the bullet feel?
New York appeal, in L.A. they gang bang
But if you touch a mic your motherfuckin ass hang
That's facts, niggaz don't receive no type of slack
'Cause if they do, they ass is always runnin' back
Not this time, but next time I'ma name names
LL, shittin from on top of the game
I shot ya!"
91,I Want You,1985,Radio (1985),,LL Cool J,"(Intro: LL Cool J)
Look girl, I'm not gonna sing
'Cause I just don't do that
(LL Cool J)
I see you in between class when my mind does a task
One glimpse of your eyes and my heart beats fast
A mysterious fantasy, lovely young queen
You're poll so subtle just like the magazine
Come and visit my sister she's in the livin' room
Eat doughnuts and milk, listen to a pop tune
Used to be my baby-sitter, I want you for my women
Without you girl, my life is bitter like a lemon
I want you, I want you
(LL Cool J)
I day-dream of seeds girl when you pass by
I wonder what the future holds for you and I
I tell my friends favorite tales about me and you
My total devotion for you is true
See you get on the bus I trip as I get on
My body gets warm but my mind is torn
I admit you're the queen of elegant
Maybe I'm just another ""puppy love lucids""
I will tell you straight up, not to load on a letter
Opportunity knocks, I feel I just better
Dissapear out of sight, rejection is my fright
To me you're like a drug-boy, easy red light
I want you, I want you
(LL Cool J)
To weak or wreak I can't speak I'm messin' up in school
Just to hear your name girl, it's makes me drool
As you sing ""Full Settle"" on the college choir
My temperature level grows much higher
Spent a night over my house with my sister and friends
I wish you wouldn't treat me like I'm your cousin
Your high-school year book under my pillow
You walk by my window, I see your silhou-ette
Candle light is what I desire
But all I get to do is fix your flat tyre
When you ring my bell, perfume I smell
The aroma pierces through my heart-cell
I tell you that my sisiter isn't here today
You go away but I wish you'd stay
Yes girl, I'm twistin' around your finger
When you leave your perfume lingers
I want you, I want you
(LL Cool J)
The clock tick-tocks as I lay in my bed
It's visions of you circlin' through my head
I sip lemon, Ice-T, read a magazine
Wish we were involved in a sneaky love scene
Saturday night it's time to party y'all
But an unseen force has my back for the wall
All eyes hit the door, red dress shines loud
The moment has come, my fantasys' here now
You sip Gin and Tonic with the double-hole straw
Finally I get the nerve to by you one more
The bar tender smirks, I whisper: ""he's a jerk""
I'm wearin' leather pants and a thirty dollar shit
Often usin' double mints, sit back, crack a smile
Tryin' to act like y'all relaxed and not a child
See I'm sixteen and you're in college
Love is sweet, then please give me the knowledge
I want you, I want you
(LL Cool J)
See it's easy to detect a line that's been said
What you don't know is your the women I've wanted to get
For years and now I'm here sweet dear
Cool in the snow under a polar bear
I light your cigarette with a Raphel lighter
Your dress seems like it's gettin' tighter and tighter
The ice cubes' melt, the heat is felt
The cards' on the table and my deal is dealt
I want you, I want you
(LL Cool J)
I had to subsequent my soul, cowardness kept a hold on me
And the key was analysed on my role as a man
To instigate romance not break down and cry
When you ask for a dance
Some fellas talk to her but she walks by
She can only say no, it's not do or die
Like Bedstock, it's natures' way
A sweet love story from LL Cool J
I want you, I want you"

Lyrics:
Wooh
And you say New York City (uhuh)
Back by popular demand (ah ya ya ya ya ya ya ya)
You been waitin' in the bay for us so long baby
We had 'em starvin'
Ay yo E, the big homie
Star studded, my ear lobes is flooded
DJ's wanna rub it, bootleggers wanna dub it
Easy does it
Ladies love it, cats with big budgets
We be gel two jets and Tar Smith luggage
Clowns talkin' rubish and pretendin' they thuggish
But I'm a young livin' legend like Pee Wee at the Rucker's (uhuh)
I was raised outta Queens
But rap kept me off of the cover of Fed's magazine
Put me in a Gulf Stream
Your man done it, push the EX 100
And you don't want it, I got the whole rap game cornered
Watch me flaunt it, damn right I'm iconic
Soon as Nix find an icy track I slide on it
I know there's got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
I'm about to get her
And I know there's gotta some kind of chick up off in here that's got the hots for me
I'm about to get her
See I know there's got to be one sassy little freak that wanna leave with me
I'm about to get her
I know there's got to be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
I'm about to get her
The beach front estate, mega yacht by the lake
The safe in the floor with a life time of cake
Wifey emailing, make my side vibrate
Cats can't believe I'm still hot, I got 'em irate
The hip hop boss of the Empire State
Cats never front on me, they know I drive weight
He's the best that ever did it, they call me Cool J
They platinum selling or, my skins turning gray
Okay
They don't know how to act
And my BDS was miles ago to Cali and back
Minimum
Private jets in the millennium
Plenty of Benjamin's, hot ladies and gentleman (but I said) and
I know there's got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
I'm about to get her
And I know there's gotta some kind of chick up off in here that's got the hots for me
I'm about to get her
See I know there's got to be one sassy little freak that wanna leave with me
I'm about to get her
I know there's got to be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
I'm about to get her
I know that it's ridiculous for y'all to picture this
The way I keep reein' up, servin' and flippin' this
Dot the I's cross the T's meticulous
The coldest winter ever and I'm so icicle-ish
The movement is flavorful, bags of licorice
The drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace
There's no forgettin' this, the way that I'm reppin this
My bodyguard's big but do that make me rebelish
I'm in the Hamptons, game stronger than Sampson
That's why I'm still a teen pop idol like Hanson
Young black and handsome, movin' with the cheddar
Bring honey to the V.I.P., I'm about to get her
Let's go
I know there's got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
I'm about to get her
And I know there's gotta some kind of chick up off in here that's got the hots for me
I'm about to get her
See I know there's got to be one sassy little freak that wanna leave with me
I'm about to get her
I know there's got to be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
I'm about to get her
Uh, put your hands in the air
Yeah
Throw ya hands in the air (7x)
I know there's got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
I'm about to get her
And I know there's gotta some kind of chick up off in here that's got the hots for me
I'm about to get her
See I know there's got to be one sassy little freak that wanna leave with me
I'm about to get her
I know there's got to be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
I'm about to get her
Uh

Yeah

(He's bad...)
No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop,
Make you say, ""Go LL and do the wop""
If you think you can outrhyme me, yeah boy I bet
'Cause I ain't met a muthafucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter I'm better my rhymes are good
I got a gold name plate that says I wish you would
And when rap begin then I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over you know I'm a win
Cool J has arrived so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd they say the kid don't play!
Sparring competition that's my hobby and job
I don't wear a disguise because I don't owe the mob
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped
So many girls on my jock I think my phone here is tapped

I'm like Tyson icin' I'm a soldier at war
I'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more
Got concrete rhymes been rappin' for ten years and
Even when I'm braggin' I'm bein' sincere
MC's can't win I make 'em rust like tin
They call me Jaws my hat is like a shark's fin
Because I'm bad as can be got my voice on wax
Some brothers think he's making records now he must have relaxed
I couldn't shouldn't and it'll stay that way
The best rapper you've heard is LL Cool J
Kamikaze take a look at what I've done
Used to rock in my basement now I'm number one
And can happen on time never standin' on lime
You wanna try me first you better learn how to rhyme
I'm the pinnacle that means I reign supreme
And I'm notorious I'll crush you like a jelly bean
I'm bad
I eliminate punks cut 'em up in chunks
You were souped you heard me and your ego shrunk
I'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame
I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane
I'm as strong as a bull of course you know I am pull
I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full
Not Buckaroo Bonsai but busted out as I
Say the kind of rhymes that make the sea's twist at high tide
Never retire or put my mike on the shelf
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself
Not bitter or mad just provin' I'm bad
You want a hit give me a hour plus a pen and a pad
MC's they retreat 'cause they know I can beat 'em
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em
I'm the best takin' out all rookies
So forget Oreos eat Cool J coookies

L.L. I'm bad other rappers know
When I enter the center they say, ""Yo, yo there he go!""
My paycheck's large Mr. Bogart in charge
Not a puncher or hunter from a rap cool large
The original Todd teachin' how to be hard
Take the skin off a snake and split a pea from a pod
You're a novice I'm noble and I decipher my tongue
Not Atilla the Hun but no I'm Threwler his son
My vocals exact like rack and pinion in a Jag
You try to brag you get your rhymes from a grab-bag
No good scavenger catfish vulture
My tongue's a chisel and this compositions sculptured

And gets the seven digits, you know the routine
You're the type of guy that tells her, ""Stay inside""
While you're steady frontin' in your homeboy's ride
I'm the type of guy that comes when you leave
I'm doin' your girlfriend, that's somethin' you can't believe
'Cause I'm that type of guy
You're the type of guy that gets suspicious
I'm the type of guy that says, ""The puddin' is delicious""
You're the type of guy that has no idea
That a sneaky, freaky brother's sneakin in from the rear
I'm the type of guy to eat it, when he won't
And look in the places that your boyfriend don't
You're the type of guy to try to call me a punk
Now knowin' that your main girl's bitin' my chunk
I'm the type of guy that loves a dedicated lady
Their boyfriends are borin', and I can drive 'em crazy
You're the type of guy to give her money to shop
She gave me a sweater kiss thank you, sweetheart
I'm that type of guy
I'm the type of guy that picks her up from work early
Takes her to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and breakfast
You're the type of guy eatin' a TV dinner
Talkin' about... ""Goddamn it, I'ma kill her""
I'm the type of guy to make her say, ""Why you're illin', Bee?""
...You're the type of guy to say, ""My lower back is killin' me""
...Catch my drift?
You're the type of guy that likes to drink Olde English
I'm the type of guy to cold put on a pamper
You're the type of guy to say, ""What you talkin' bout?""
I'm the type of guy to leave my drawers in your hamper
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
You know what I mean?
Check it out...
T-y-p-e g-u-y
I'm that type of guy to give you a pound and wink my eye
Like a bandit, caught me redhanded, took her for granted
But when I screwed her, you couldn't understand it
'Cause you're the type of guy that don't know the time
Swearin' up and down, ""That girl's all mine""
I'm the type of guy to let you keep believin' it
Go 'head to work, while I defrost it, and season it
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
Know what I mean
I'm that type of guy
""So ridiculous""
So funny
I don't know
Come on down
Yeah
Like real cool, you know what I mean?
I like just going to your front door ringin' bells
And just like, ha, leave..."
95,I've Changed,2006,Todd Smith (2006),,LL Cool J,"(Feat. Ryan Toby)
(LL Cool J)
Just starin' at these four walls closin
In on me, feelin' like time's frozen
Fadin in and out, noddin and dozin
Guilt tearin up my brain like erosion
What I did to you was wrong I admit it
I regret that I did it like a junkie when he's jonzin
All alone in what used to be a home
But you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in
The voicemail that you left me was scoldin
Hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron
Cause it was all true, that's why we all through
Now your girl's pickin' up the cell when I call you
Talkin' slick like she ain't here
She don't want you no more, punk disappear - click
I need to hit her with a brick
But that'll only lead me to a worse predicament
I hope your girlfriend ain't got you on a liquor binge
With her bitter attitude just 'cause she's sick of men
But I'ma keep on callin, fightin till the end
On my knees till they bleed, to prove my love again
(Chorus: Ryan Toby)
I sit in front of yo' crib in the pourin rain
Whylin out screamin yo' name
And keepin' ringin' yo' bell till you mad as hell
And call the po'-po', I ain't afraid (yeah, yeah)
You can get yo' folks and yo' cousins and them
And try to run me off yo' blocka (uh-huh)
But I ain't scared, I ain't goin' nowhere
And I ain't stoppin' till I gotcha
To show you I changed shawty
(LL Cool J)
I seen you at the movies with some tall cat
So I bust his headlights with a ball bat
When I was with you he would give me dap and all that
Now you in his arms in the mall, what you call that?
That's what I get for creepin' and crawlin
Every other weekend gone until the mornin
Sneakin out to my dirt, dead wrong
Comin' back past dawn with the guilty mask on
And I never counted the cost, took heed to warnings
Try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn
And it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights
Shakin in cold sweats and your whole life's a wreck
That was the old me, the one I still regret
The one you couldn't respect, the one you should forget
But I'ma keep on callin, fightin till the end
On my knees till they bleed, to prove my love again
(Ryan Toby + (LL))
To show you I changed shawty
I really did change shawty (I'M TELLIN' YOU I'VE CHANGED)
I wanna show you I changed shawty
(I STILL LOVE YOU!) [cars peel]
(LL Cool J)
I don't care if the cops got me surrounded
SWAT teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in
My mind's in an altered state
Like I'm headed for a wall, top speed, foot off the brake
I make a fool of myself, girl whatever it takes
I already played the fool when I let you escape
You're as, good as it gets, your friendship your sex
Everything about you and yours connects
From your, beautiful smile to the scent of your skin
The sheets smell different, this is not livin'
It feels like dyin', God knows I'm tryin'
Ain't no sight sadder than a grown man cryin
Please find it in your heart to forgive me
Realize only God can convict me
We all make mistakes, so have you
If God show mercy on me, then you should too
(Ryan Toby + (LL))
To show you I changed shawty
I really did change shawty (I'M TELLIN' YOU I'VE CHANGED)
I wanna show you I changed shawty
(I still love you!) oww!

Uh, pimp shit
Yeah, turn my shit up a little bit
My vocals, uh, uh
I hypnotize ya eyez and then you recognize
That the sparkles of my chrome shoes paralyze
Gettin' money like this, people want my vibe
Full of jealousy and pride, hate the way I ride
Sometimes ya speak, sometimes ya don't
Figure this nigga souped up, 'cause he couped up
Guaranteed to rip shit, soon as its louped up
Ya niggas slept, 20 girls panties wasn't wet
I'm a star, double the dick, the double R
Never score hard to leave the bubble scarred
Not the car, it's the man, daddy cool put it down
No comparin' me to y'all, nigga is such a clowns
L.A. worth paper, ask Russell Simmons who put 'em up in that skyscraper
Ask my dogs up at Fubu, who made them major
LL nigga, now who's next that need a favor
Drop a bomb on 'em
Remain calm on 'em
Peirce the nipples, throw the LL charm on 'em
Keep gangsta shit pumpin through my system
When my strobe lights flash you can't miss' em
Listen
Call my name, ooh
Call my name, uh
Call my name, aw yeah
Call my name
59th street bridge up a roadway, do about a buck
Pumpin Mobb up in the Cadillac truck, don't give a fuck
Gold tint, goldiggen broads getting bent
We can fuck, but you ain't getting 10 cent, Who want it?
Lay the facts out until the cats out
Set 'cha back out, sweat 'cha tracks out, blow out your weed
You wake up in the mornin to a note, ""Nigga had to leave.""
Be easy, you shoulda teased me, instead of bein sleazy
I wouldn't do a threezy, come across more floss than gold teeth
I learned you can't eat, if ya hold beef, with niggas underneath
Still I'm a lyrically hold it down
L back in town, 'case the bell sound for second round
Some of these old ctas is funny, fuck who's legendary
I'm tryin' to get this money
Drop a bomb on 'em, and pour a dom on 'em
As soon as the track come on, I transform on 'em
Keep gangsta shit pumpin through my system
Strobe lights flashin can't miss' em
Listen
Call my name, ooh
Call my name, uh
Call my name, aw yeah
Call my name
Rappers don't reall want it, they might claim they do
They know I'm catchin bodies, go 'head name a few
After I blaze you, I get a doughnut
Don't want no blood up on my chrome shoes
Lord have mercy, this rookies got it confused
You thought you caught me slippin, I was falsely accused
Sleepin' with my eyez wide shut, like Tom Cruise
They wishin an impossible mission to see me lose
Lay up time to choose, all I hate is on the left
You hopin and prayin' you get to hear me take my last breath
Lyrically, but I gang bang the track, chop sling like Cracker
Hundred keys a month, you fuckin' up G backs nigga
Invincible, unstoppable y'all niggas ain't ill your illogicale
This is L, the pigeon thriller, dream fulfiller
A little somethin' for ya ice guerillas
Drop a bomb on 'em
When its time to attack Quiet Storm on 'em
Hold ya nuts and keep ya palms on 'em
Keep gangsta shit pumpin through my system
When my strobe lights flash you can't miss' em

Call my name, ooh

Can't a young man make money anymore?
Wear my jewels and like freak it on the floor
Or is it my job to make sure I'm poor?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Keep a cigar in between my jaws
I drink champagne, to hell with Coors
Never sold coke in my life, I do tours
Get that flashlight out of my face
I'm not a dog, so damn it, put away the mace
I got cash and real attorneys on the case
You're just a joker perpetratin a ace
You got time, you wanna give me a taste
I don't smoke cigarettes, so why you're lookin' for base?
You might plant a gun, and hope I run a race

Slam me on the hood, yo, that ain't right
You pull out your gun if I'm puttin' up a fight

Know what I'm saying, uh yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah I like that
Give me some more, some more of my vocals
You know sex 'em up a little bit
You know what I mean?
You're the honey that I see when I'm riding by
The one giving me a feeling that I can't deny
You got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh
Acting like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye
Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer
You're turning me on, keep me standing up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough
I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between
Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see
Baby I'm down on my knees let your world be free
Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny
Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens
Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18
To hell with your boss
Let that nigga hear you scream
Sounding like that screech on the fax machine
Then we can take it to the ladies bathroom
Make your mascara run till you look like a raccoon
Touch yourself baby tell me it's wet
Squeeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go
I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)
Have you calling me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill
I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide

Me and my fold got my broads collide
(Imagine that)
Knocking girls off two at a time
(Imagine that)
Disrespect you and still make you mine
(Uh-uh)
Uh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school
You've been a bad girl you broke all the rules
Forgot your homework, chewed gum in class
And the only way to fix it is to give me some ass
I got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk
I kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh
You're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks
The vibe is thick baby, we both red hot
I kiss your neck unbutton your blouse
Let my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth
Your apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life
Got your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight
You could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey
But no Trojan soldier scold you like me
Match the calculus then measure my frequency
But when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree
Put your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails
Give me goose pimples when ya put yo tongue on my dimples
Baby feel me now you got yo ass suspended
Got a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it
I stopped by the crib you invited me in
You convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin
Then you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back
You twisting, kissing ya fist like that
Rubber meets the road till the tire goes flat
I filled it up with air again baby hold that
You a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet
Squeeze tight so I never forget the teacher's pet
I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl

Make you trick on me around the world

Have you calling me your ultimate thrill

Knocking girls off two at a time
(Imagine that)
Disrespect you and still make you mine
(Uh-uh)
You was laughing with your girlfriends, sippin' a drink
When I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink
Guided you to the dance floor and held you tight
We in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights
I'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice
You rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes
The club is so black we can't see our own hands
I know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants
You bold huh, wanna feel it in your hands
Rub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it
God gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it
Life is a song, you were born to perform it
Drink the Cristal at the same time
Get intoxicated till we lose are minds
The crowd separated as we start to shine
I lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb
We tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd
The lights start to flash the music is too loud
We hit the back door and jump in the limousine
You pull up your skirt I put some ice in between
You're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet
Even though we outside I hear the bass from the beat
Funkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks
DJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep
No problem uh mi spouse no aqui
Tu muy caliente tu vamos con mi
Si mami I'm the chaffer make it whip
Take a ride bet you never forget
Here we go
I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl

Make you trick on me around the world

Have you calling me your ultimate thrill

It'll make you bitch niggas as hard as rocks
Givin' head to the glock, pretend it's hard cock
Splashin niggas I came slow through the block
I'm, the original, visual, individual
Ten times platinum your career's lookin' critical
Reach for this, motherfuck being a criminal
Look in your bitch eyes, the vibe is subliminal
You wanna freestyle fuck that
I need at least seven figures to even touch that
But since everybody was underestimatin' my format
I dropped Ill Bomb and now niggas want more of that
Ain't a rapper dead or alive fuckin' wit me
Ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me
Talk about paper, I can talk about broads
I can talk about movies, I can talk about awards
Fuck the fantasies, yo I got all four
And 2001'll be mine, by law
Why name the Greatest Of All Times?
Because for fifteen years I kept y'all standin in line
Lovin' the way I shine and my lyrics combine
With the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find
Fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits
My hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch

Rhyme to the rhythm of a or should I give a brother time
And move on, you better get another vick to work with - or quit
'Cause I'm on some ol' L shit
Capable of murder but I never committed
Takin' no shorts so you better forget it
Tracklin' the world on my tone deafen station, taught her
Supercalifalistic emcee excutioner
Wicked witch, diggin' your ditch
Givin' ya stitch by stitch, ain't this a bitch
Sweeter than lemonade, stronger than a hand-grenade
Rhymes are laid, go deeper than a mermaid
Louder than a siren, I'm not retirin'
Despirin', admirin' the way I'm gettin' fly and
I sees ecleptoes and I resent those
Brothers who slept on, when they shoulda kept on
Rollin' with rush it don't get no rougher
I stopper, huffer and puffer, a buffer, suffer
I was holdin' back the man superior, right?
You wanna take my title, yo, you'll be aight
You stand below the plateau I stand on
You want my faction to put the man on
I Shake'n'Bake and break the laws of gravity
And if you chew on, you'll get a cavity
'Cause I'ma giant, and you're a pee-wee
And all that LL shit, you can't see me
You're cheap and weak, incomplete and off-peak
ER-ERM! Cause it gets no rougher
It gets no rougher
Yo man, you know how to take the order a-b-c emcee's youknowhatI'msayin'?
Yo, cuttin' ain't no joke, yo L, release the juice on 'em
(LL Cool J)
I release the juice smack dab in your face
Do damage, I'm pickin' up the pace
My mics' like a torch when I'm walkin' at nighttime
Straight to the dome, it's like a pipe-line
High speed, stronger than Thai-Weed
And before you pick up the mic to get fly
You need all the dope khaki's that you can feature
So I can serve you, you know the procedure
Listen to the man intellectualize, visualize
Your whole posse gettin' paralysed
I don't wanna hear no alibi's, don't apologize
ER-ERM-ERM, I'll put the highs' in your EYES!
The bass in your face, like you ditch the attorney, I'm on the case
With rhymes that'll hit ya, get ya and sit ya down
The competition is booty get the picture now?
Skip the record, my road, to get me-a-go
I'm figurin' yo, nigga you know
I won't allow, not now, no way, no how
Any form of disrespect, you better bow
Time gets rough to swamp I do it pump
In between my jaws adversaries got chomped
The cordless mic is my only utensil
Lyrics you be runnin', I break 'em like a pencil
'Cause I'm massive, and you're a small fry
You're all in, a stunt, a fall-guy
Outta order I smolder blacks to make you SUFFER!
Cause it gets no rougher, it gets no rougher
Shut up, the alley cats' got attention to get
And drop these L dope lyrics on ya, the beat is pumpin', youknowI'msayin'?
Tell 'em
(LL Cool J)
Let me ask you ask a question...
You could take the game of rap and rule it alone
Demonstrate many styles on the microphone
Build an empire like an African King
I had to show Apu Jack the Ripper could swing
I'ma rappers nightmare, I crush my opponents
There's only one title - I own it
Emcee's flip-flop, I bust out the workshop
They try to eve'sdrop, goin' to make rock
Aerodynamically, it's all automatically
The way I jiggly full of originality
Shay-shop 'em and stop 'em like a cheetah and an antelope
Then I cut 'em like a cantalope - on the table
They ain't able, I'm a legend, not a fable, gotta keep it stable
Crack your back bone, harder than grimstone
Doin' your justice overseein' like a chaporone
Huh, on the hip-hop scene, I got shit sewn up like a sewin' machine
Eat a rapper like a sandwich, leave 'em in a bandit
Crack the stage and leave the audience damaged
(Interlude: LL Cool J)
Yeah, get funky on that cut, get funky on it
(Yo, L, them lyrics is dope man youknowI'msayin'?
You better raw sick for years..) this how we do it dogg
(...Pump that good man, let's cut us some real, real somethin')
Yo, bust this
(LL Cool J)
I'm kinda like a soldier, see I told ya
When I pick up the mic I'ma hold ya
Captive, a mack-tive, I'll make sure I'll track it
L'll speak a cell a sneak as your backs' gettin' weaker
I freak the beat and get shieker
Rule over King, you're too over-eager
You're tryin' to make a move for
I'ma prove you're ridiculious
I think he was jealous and in the mood for an ass-kickin'
When you mess with, the man with the plan
Mic in his hand and a fresh skit
R-O-U-G-H-E-R, ROUGHER! So here we are
Face to face, mic to mic, man to man
While your battle ship is sinkin' in quicksand
Strappin' to the bottom like a two-ton anchor
And break, pull the rope, point blank, I'm a sniper
Rapper like a pack, step on 'em like a mack
My DJ Cut-Creator scratch a record like a cat
E at my side with pride who got a bigger rep
Shh... smoke the mic like a cigarette
Every puff is rough I pull, kill a bull
One toke, your crews' a joke
I run through rappers like runnin' through rubber holes is
Nigga, I'm comin' up roses
Step back - I got the title - bear-witness to a dope recital
I've killed many men my friend and I'ma do it again and again and again
Cause it gets no rougher

Big money, big spender, big getter
Big hustler, big grinder, do you get the big picture - ya dig?

Block rocker, rude bwoy, top shotter
Ay! This is for my down South trappers
My midwest slabbers - ya dig?
Ay! Yup yup, this is for my East coast slangers
My West coast bangers - ya dig?

103,It's Time for War,2008,Exit 13 (2008),,LL Cool J,"Welcome to Exit 13
I am your host
LL Cool J
You said I was finished
And Father Time was the blame
You disrespected my legacy
And threw dirt on my name
Told DJs he's over
He ain't spittin' the same
What he says is irrelevant
Hip-Hop culture has changed
When I walk in the room
Young boys look at me strange
As if I am a relic
From some long forgotten game
It makes my blood boil
Turns my eyes to flames
I built an empire
They tried to kick me out in the rain
So I called on an inner power
It's hard to explain
It's like a holy spirit
Utilizing Hip-Hop slang
I'm beyond the gold grills
And logos on chains
You see I changed rap forever
I elevated the game
Launched the greatest label
In the history of rap
And for 24 years
I carried it on my back
I've always shined brighter
When I'm under attack
I might be down for a moment
But I always come back
It's time for war X9
This is a resurrection
I'm back from the dead
They told me quit a long time ago
But I conquered instead
I had dreams and visions
Swirling around in my head
I had this hunger deep inside of me
That has to be fed
Hip-Hop will respect
All the blood that I shed
I have a covenant with God
I have swallowed the bread
Hip-Hop my co-defendant
With this mic I thee wed
I made an entire generation
Obey what we said
I'm talkin' France to Germany
From Italy to Japan
From London to Belgium
To Afghanistan
From Farmers Boulevard
Smokin' a blunt with my man
To writin' rhymes on a ironing board
To build Def Jam
You see, I'm the undisputed
King of all Hip-Hop
Everything after is my legacy
Like it or not
And I will keep making history
I can't stop
LL Cool J
Eternally hot
It's time for war X9
Look at how easily I flipped it
And switched the style around
Competition losin' their footing
I see them falling down
They will plot against me
It kills them because I'm ballin' now
Some of y'all didn't pick up the phone
But I got you callin' now
This is a job that must get done
Even if I become public enemy number one
If I had to pick up an Uzi
That weighs over a ton
I will attack Hip-Hop
Until competition is none
Nobody on God's earth wants it with L
You end up tortured
And trapped in psychological hell
And this is the beginning
Of a new era in rap
LL Cool J, feel the impact
It's okay if you call it a comeback
And let them know
I'm ready for combat
Tell those dumb motherfuckers to fall back
The crown looks wrong on your head
I want that
It's time for war X9
It's time for war
It's time for war"
104,Jack the Ripper,1989,Walking With A Panther (1989),,LL Cool J,"Milky, and I'm back
My ace in the hole was this brand new track
I'ma slow it up and speed it up and now you're gonna eat it up
Listen to the funky beat, my tongue is gonna beat it up
I did it, but the devil didn't make me
I did it for the suckers who tried to shake and bake me
Proving a point that I'm a serious joint
You can roll me up and puff me, and then I'll anoint
Your head with oil--lots of oil
Make it run like water, watch it boil
'Cause I made 'em play it, made 'em say it
Made 'em okay it, made 'em obey it---HUH
Prince of the growl is on the prowl
How You Like Me Now punk? You living foul
Here's what my game is, kill is what my aim is
A washed up rapper needs a washer, my name is--
Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack-Jack the Ripper
Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack-Jack, Jack the Ripper
King Hercules!
Back for the payback, I must say that
I heard your new jam, I don't play that
It ain't loud enough punk, it ain't hitting
This year you tried, next year you're quitting
Last year you thought I was dying out
But again, and again, and again without a doubt
It's the gangster boogie, the earthquake sound
Pump it up and play it so they hear it all around
I do it up rough, tough, I don't bluff
And this is an example of funky stuff
When you wanna make hits, you make 'em like this
They ain't like this they don't hit, they miss
It's a strong record, a record for the strong
For those who appreciate real rap songs
Listen how I won't allow myself to go off track
Stay back, I got the power, I'm--
Jack the Ripper, a man, not a myth
A-k-a James Todd Smith
Hard like penitentiary steel
Breaking necks while I flex my sex appeal
Homegirls in the house, c'mon
Homegirls in the house, give it up
You gotta want to get hotter
Moving and grooving, and always improving a lot'a
People don't know how nice I am
He was sleeping, so now I gotta slice my man
Like ham in a pan, wrap him up in Saran
Kidnap him and slap him up inside of a van
While you're doing your dance I want you to make moves
No one out there thought you could do
You know my name and my game and what I'm here to do
Party people, lemme see if you can dance to--
Break it down! [x3]
Yo Bob, show that old school sucker punk what real hip hop is boy
(Scratches)
""How Ya Like Me Now?"" I'm getting busier
I'm double platinum, I'm watching you get dizzier
Check out the way I say my, display my, play my
'J' on the back, behind the Cool, without the A-Y
I love to ride the groove because the groove is smooth
It makes me move and I'll improve
As it goes on, as it flows on
When you see me, don't ask if the show's on
How that sound? Don't came around, playing me close, brown
Pull on my jock to be down
You need to stay down, way down, because you're low down
Do that dance, the prince of rap is gonna throw down
Aiming to please while I'm killing emcees
I'm gonna keep on hitting you with rough LPs
Day after day after day
You're smacked in the face by the bass of Cool J
I'm--[scratches]
I'm a beast on the microphone, a night stalker
A killing machine, a savage street talker
Jason with an axe, but I put it on wax
To eradicate the suckers who thought I had relaxed
The prince of hip hop, straight from Queens
Kicking it mean, keeping it clean
And you've never seen anybody rock the party
All you funky beat-aholics, this beat's Bacardi
I go to the show, and terrorize emcees, don't you know
Moving my hand like I'm playing the piano
Don't touch the dial, don't change the channel
Don't let me hear you say I ain't debonair
I'm better than any emcee out there
As a matter of fact, suckers can't compare
When I rocking the mic people stop and stare, at..."

Jealousy - I wanna kill him and shoot him
He's a sucker - I'd like to execute him
Recruit him - put him in my school and school him
I said somethin' simple, and I knew that I'd fool him
He's only mediocre, jealousy can't get with me
Hang up your clothes, cause jealousy ain't spent to me
He's just a monkey, ridin' my back
In fact I kidnap, ramsack, hijack and backslap the fool...
... See my name is Cool J
I play for keeps, the microphone's my tool
I've been holdin' back long enough I had to bring it
Jealousy is in the house y'all, fellas sing it

I'm not lackadaisical or lazy on the microphone
I bring the bacon home so jealousy go home
Or play the wall and pout about the way the prince is rollin'
So when they give it up, stand back and start foldin
All your jealous show clothes, I think you need to grab a
Half-pint of Cisco and hang out with Backstabber
'Cause I'ma break down all walls Jealousy built
And then walk tall, like I'm standin on stilts yeah
Jealousy the jam is mean you'll have to rewind it
If you didn't know about him, you must have been blinded
Ask him if I'm right, he'll tell you he sure is
Excuse me for a moment, fellas sing a smooth chorus
Jealous... Jealous...

Jealous... Jealous...
Word up, check it out

Thank you fellas, the way you sung the chorus was swift
But now it's time to pump lyrics, and shoot the gift
His name is Jealousy fellas see what I mean now turn it out
Without a doubt and if it hits you in the heart don't pout
'Cause I'ma hit Jealousy and his posse where it hurts a lot
Him and his boys have a habit, they always smirk a lot
And make mean faces, I see 'em in many places
Scared to face us, they wish they could erase us
Or outdo us, can't do damage and never will
The Legend in Leather is clever, man I'ma never chill
Allah take a break from this, yo I love swingin'
Yo E, pop the bubbly, fellas, start singin'
Jealous... Jealous...
KnowhatI'msayin?
It's like a crazy gangster groove, youknowhatImean?
Jealous... Jealous...

Cause yo I'm the prince of rap knowhatI'msayin? Word up
Jealous... Jealous...
Yo... it's crazy... I am the one
Bust it
Ooh yeah, now I'ma wind it up
It's time to move on and end the Jealousy cut
And head off with a bang that sang and kicked your brain in
I flowed like water now I'm finished explainin
In the spotlight tonight his name was Jealousy
And for some strange reason, it seems fellas be
Fallin' for him, I hope you understood
Stay away from him he ain't no good
YouknowhatI'msayin man yo (that's word yeah I hear that)
Yeah word up (can't hang out man)
Yo it ain't nuttin yo yaknowwhatI'msayin

Pure raw
We sold out
You bought more
It was meant to be
Hip hop died, reincarnated through me
Now the promoters gotta double my fee
'Cause these pop melodies ain't fucking with me
Get back on your tour bus roll some broccoli
I'll leave your crew twisted and your hoes knock kneed
Hell through (time) and the game in my speed
'Cause water down hip hop we do not need
Yes sir, I got the real recipe
A little bit of old E and bon bon Z
I guess by now you can tell you miss me
The baddest motherfucker in rap history
One to the temple put you out your misery
That's not an album, that's a Frisbee
Tangle with LL boy that's risky
Them boys is backwash, we want whiskey
(Jump on it! jump on it!)
When the chips is down you gotta fight for the crown
(Jump on it! jump on it!)
Tell them boys over there get down or lay down
(Jump on it! jump on it!)
I got the house of pain for your little pop clown
(Jump on it! jump on it!)
Don't get it criss cross we're taking over the town
Roll up on your set pull out the 4 pound
Who's pitching out here blast them off the mound
The game got us bored, no rebound
Claims he's hardcore how he sound
My radio's a bunch of noise in the background
For a factory manufacturing pop clowns
That's what happens when LL ain't around
The pop stars flooding and the hip hop drowns
DJ suffer while sarada goes round
You screaming? got the real creaming
Welcome to hip hop, we're out here fiending
Watch a program directed in the bin and
Went from cruss group to a boy band screaming
When it come under the car I ain't leaning
I wish I could bump the brim creaming
I tell you what, play my stupid - call it even

What y'all want, no cut!
What y'all need, pure raw
What we do, we sold out
All because... you bought more!
No affects on my voice, that's my choice
Hard raw beat make a soft voice moist
Get the dinero bring the heat like Jon Voight
Timbaland music, rolls royce
Hit you in the head like a fat joint
Back to the S's big meat in Detroit

And nice round hips, I mean her body's a trip
And when I go over her house, you know what I like?
The way she tells me ""take it off"" and never says ""syke""
Yo, I'm never in need, she's feedin my greed
She never waits for me to ask, she takes the lead
Her tongue is sticky, and hickeys are her specialty
E wants her, but she saves the good stuff for me
Her name is Kanday, she's dandier than Dandy Don
You're mad and I'm happy that she put me on
I'll never leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I - feel - good) -->[James Brown]

Whoooo!
About Kanday
(I - feel - good)
Whoooo!
About Kanday
(I - feel - good)
Now and Laters gum drops, jellybeans
Brothers beg for the leg, she's on the cheerleading team
It feels wicked, every time I stick it, that's right
When we're alone she never ever acts polite
Hey yo, she blows me kisses, she does my dishes
I wished I bust two and she grants my wishes
She's clever in bed, she uses her head
She's the kinda girl that keeps a fat man well fed
Left to right all night, the chick's outta sight
I broke my lamp shade in half because I don't use a light
Man, she's juicy like a berry, chocolate with the cherry
Ask me if it's good and I'll have to say very
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would

I'm feelin' gooder than good, if you wouldn't I would
If you could, I know you could, she's kickin back in the hood
When she starts to get off she can knock off a cough
I know 'cough' don't rhyme with 'boss', but she made me her boss
She's the talk of my room whenever I'm in my room
My little brother loves her more than his favorite cartoon
Her body's bad, the girl's built, skin like silk
Wet, steamy and warm just like a hot cup of milk
She's all the way live, keeps me satisfied
I don't go outside, I like to stay inside
Her ways are like a angel, with bright white wings
And I'm crazy 'bout the way Kanday shakes her thing
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would

Ooh, you couldn't imagine, I'm lickin' my lips
If she was tea I'd take a sip, when I'm in gym I do flips
I'm in love with the pizznoot, it's proper as hell
I'm hittin harder than hard, always makin' her yell
She's cooler than an iceberg, word to the mother
In the house, down the steps and under the covers
Right away, no sation, or frontin, or playin'
Or delayin, I'm never steppin off, I'm always stayin
Her mother knows me well, father hates my guts
He don't know when we're alone she's always feelin' on my niggy-niggy-nuts
For a snack, cornflakes, crackerjacks
Day after day I try to break that back
And man, oh man, damn, you can't and I can
Last time I saw her with man I had to shake almost hands
I said ""what up"", he said ""what up"", ""I took your girl, so what up?""
Gotta walk on the ground with a hole to fill up
All the boys laugh about her, Darryl and Dewayne
Bobcat and Earl, but they must be insane
Michael Spelling's on my side, and big Chuck the Grease
She's my private freaky deak, my own personal skeez
Wouldn't leave her for nothin', only a crazy man would

The other chick will give me heat while I shampoo her hair
Head tilted back baby no more tears
You mumblin' and shit duke my flow more clear
Baby listen here, I been gettin' paper for years
And program directors who fronted they disappear
And grimy ass niggas get laced with car bombs
For bein' over-critical when Uncle get it on

Live the lifestyles so the average dime piece
Wanna have my lovechild and roll L style
A man hostile, but my Queens niggas run wild
So when I skate through niggas strain to smile
Peep my profile and my iced-out dial
I tap my horn, say ""What up?"" but never smile
And deuce ass niggas is noodles
And your broke ass stripper weave is lookin' like a poodle
'Scuse my French, ""Je m'appelle LL""

Blood drippin, slippin off my planet
Man, the panic, funkmode
Mechanical mix flows competition in my dojo
Swing a hook, got the vertabrae, be brave
Heat gain meltin on my heatwave
Power to the crowd, pandemonium
Showin 'em how I gets down
The life of a killer is scandalous
The life of a killer is dangerous

Triggedy, sky high like a kite
God diggity, every other cloud's blue
Puff on a, yeah, puff on a
Bring it on, off, on, baby one-two
Peep in the arena, death at your doorstep
Right around the corner is the land of regret
When ya sweat to get down, sweat to get off and on
Till the... nothin' normal bout my songs
LL Cool, J jazzy jewel
Takin' dime pieces to the real school
I got 'em on nations buckin like fools
Pitbulls fightin over streets I rule
Catch it if you can when it's hot ta hit'cha hand
Throw ya skunks in the air, my funk got the flair, man
I can do division, baby I can do math
Multiplying fractions now ya know the half
Knuckle games played, must pack steel
Oh yes I'm livin' like real
To the highest extent, bloody clothes doin' battle
Till the death of my foes, it's my show"

""...Aw yeah!""
No matter how you feel, where you are
Just know that I love you, girl I do
They try to say I wasn't good enough
But I swear you won't find another
Just know that I love you, girl I do
I live for you
You're in every breath that I take
Every dream that I dream, every move that I make
My love never sleeps, every moment it's awake
My heart shines like moonlight on the lake
My soul was in prison but you helped it escape
Toned down the ego, mimimize the hate
You add to the magic I was put in to create
You make my vision clearer when I can't see straight
Show me parts of my life that I need to eliminate
Yet and still so many times I didn't demonstrate
The love that I feel, I wasn't bein real
I did so many things you wouldn't appreciate
I was a little naughty, I saw your heart break
Still you was there for me, I never had to wait
So from this day forth my heart's a clean slate
Write what you want just leave your name and date
No matter how you feel, where you are
Just know that I love you, girl I do (I do)
They try to say I wasn't good enough (They said it)
But I swear you won't find another (You won't, eh-ha)
Just know that I love you, girl I do
I live for you (I do, I live for you)
Oh, oh-oh, oh - for you girl (Girl, we gon' live it up)
Oh, oh-oh, oh - I live for you (I live for you)
Oh, oh-oh, oh (And we gon' live it up)
Just know that I love you, girl I do
I live for you
Baby girl, when you're standin on this big rock flyin through space
Havin' experiences we could never replace
Deep scars on our hearts that are hard to erase
A thorn in your side, I can see it on ya face
And every time we hug, it hurts in the same place
So you build up walls to protect you just in case
I tried to climb over but I fell on my face
I tried to dig beneath it but I couldn't penetrate
Saw a crack in my wall, that raised the stakes
Bright light shine through, help me to find you
Illuminated the inner divine you
A room with no walls, I can't define you
Too many thoughts to force my mind through
But if it hits the fan, I'm right behind you
Or you're beside me, hearts wide open and free
A love is the key
Knahmsayin, baby? (And we gon' live it up)
Yeah... Gotta open your heart (I live for you)
I had to open mine (And we gon' live it up)
Heh, yeah, yeah... me too (I live for you)"

I'm gon' be, your lollipop

Lolli-lolli-pop-pop, boppin down the block-block
I've been lovin' you since junior high, ma you got
Everything I need, everything I want
You're the type of dime a real player wanna flaunt
Lovin' them lips and the shape of them hips
When I see you in that whack brother's whip, I FLIP
I hate your boyfriend, that cat is corny
I kick it to you and I dare that clown to run up on me
When nights are stormy I be thinkin' about your pretty smile, gritty style
But duke got you locked down like Riker's Isle
I wanna break your man off, I can't control it, I'm a hater
Especially, when your perfume lingers inside the elevator
You're the one, the only one
That I would beg, to give me some
Playerism's for life, eternal flossin, proceed with caution
Baby toss him, divorce him, let the boss in
(Chorus w/ variations)
(LL Cool J)
So ballalistic, mystic, twisted
In my dreams I kissed it, never missed it, I frisked it
Searched it, worked it, lollipopped it and jerked it
You followed, swallowed, scratch my back, baby burped it
Red Passion, high fashion
Nobody got to know I'm smashin, I'm sayin' shorty
Rock, Miss Thang, playin' childish games
Standin on the corner knowin' damn well I wanna blaze
Sweet get to it anywhere you like
On the rooftop, at midnight
The project stairs, I'll be there
Runnin' my fingers through your hair
Anyway, the untouchable, magnetic
Kissable loveable huggable energetic, call a medic
Your man'll regret it, when I hit it I'm athletic
Energize your thighs you'll recognize the size
It's epidemic...
(Chorus w/ variations)
(LL Cool J)
When y'all alone in the Brooklyn brownstone
Starin' at the high ceiling, what a feeling
Clothes peeling, finally you're double dealing
I'm walkin', he's wheeling, it's unreal when
You got the dime of your fantasies
My lollipop ecstasy's on top of me
Just like I thought, it's a small world after all
I don't care if your neighbors hear us down the hall
Make 'em jealous, what they gon' tell us?
If you don't tell your girls baby, I won't tell the fellas
If you don't plea, I orchestrated icebergisms
Visions of my lollipop's thick risen, for my wisdom
Plop plop fizzdom, what I give them
Make - yeah baby, right there - my new anthem
I love you baby, take it deep deep deep
Deep deep deep, now go to sleep

Suntan oil, pina colada in you hand
Layin' up at night, peepin' out stars

I told ya my status was that of a don
You thought I was a dog and you ain't wanna get it on

On the emotions of a young lady (word up)

This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore
This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self destruct
Baby smile today
'Cause I been on that journey always
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
'Cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know
Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together
It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothing's gonna tear us apart, promise"

Don't call it a comeback
I've been here for years
I'm rockin my peers
Puttin suckers in fear
Makin the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions
Overpowerin
Over the competition I'm towerin
Records shock
When I drop these lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare
You better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's payin the price
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just gettin warm
Just like Mohammad Ali - they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Dont'cha know I had beef with
Why don't you riff with me?
The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy, get ready, 'cause it might go blauh!
How ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with Mr. Smith
Don't risk
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blastin
Outlastin

Who's the baddest female of them all?
It was Frosted Flake, she loved to bowl
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul
Rich female, very debonnaire
Drivin' a Rolls with rollers in her hair
We was hangin' out, pumpin the stereo
She took me to a club, I think the name was Cheerio's
She walked like she was jumpin' a hurdle
I was happy as a kid that just saw Mutant Ninja Turtles
A guy walked over, said, ""Your earring's cute""
I said, ""I'm wearin a earring, but it ain't no Fruit Loop""
Me and Frosted went to get a drink
But she ordered somethin' bugged and I ain't know what to think
She ordered potassium, calcium
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium
She took me to her crib, threw me on the couch
I woke up the next morning with a spoon in my mouth
She's

I went to Vegas, didn't think it'd do any harm
I walked into this girl named Lucky Charm
For some reason we walked in the rain
She had a four-leaf clover with a big gold chain
She had a salary that was full of calories, for real
And I was in the mood for a homecooked meal
So we went to be alone
But we had to be quiet, cause her cornpops was home
Kissed her neck, kissed her back, kissed her arms
I said, ""Forget it, let me see your lucky charms""
When we began her hairstyle was neat
But when I left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat
Talked about marriage, I said, ""That's risky
Besides, it's such a waste of Rice Crispies""
She had a robe with the velours material
Her pops woke up, I said, ""Hello Mr. Cereal
I came this morning to deliver the paper""
He said, ""Stop frontin, I know you caught the vapors
That's my daughter, so save your croonin
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in""

Yeah, check this out here:
Then there was Pebbles, times was rough
She was turnin' tricks to get her 'coo-coo puff!'
Her mind was gone, but she turned me on, in fact
She was wearin an Apple Jack hat
With a full-link fox and some pink bobby-socks
Her father had a greedy disease, fried chicken pocks
We called him Hungry Jack
He talked like pops, and then he dressed like The Mack
He invited me out to lunch
With a old army buddy of his, Captain Crunch
The waiter said, ""Jack, what would you like today?""
He said, ""I don't know, just make it Special, 'K?""
He said, ""Cool,"" came back with the order
That's when I said, ""Hey yo, Jack, I like your daughter""
He said, ""Pebbles? Boy, are your crazy?
I said, ""Nah, I wanna ride in a Mercedes
She could sing while I'm swingin' my thing
Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King""
He said, ""Go party, do some minglin
You and my daughter, your brain must be jinglin""
I said, ""It's smooth, no disrespect
She'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week check""
Then we walked down the aisle
Our honeymoon was milky - cereal style

Dear Mr. President, with all due respect
Wish we could have a conversation
I would take a trip down to your residence
And we would talk about the state of the nation
Mr. President, I would ask you about the war
Really and truly, what is it for?
When a I.E.D. make a soldier fall
Is he dying for something above us all?
Is it all about him at the end of the day
Is a pledge of allegiance just something to say
I hope not, 'cause I love the U.S.A.
Despite of all the drama we have today
Mr. President are you aware?
Our flesh and blood is dying over there
When the coffins come back, do you care?
When only the poor kids die, is it fair?
(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
If I could talk to the President
Would he pay attention, really listen?
If I could talk real intelligent
Would he beware and then change his position?
Now is time, time, time
For me to speak my mind, mind, mind
(LL Cool J)
Don't get me wrong, I respect the flag
But it hurt to see a kid in a body bag
He fought for his country with all he had
Now he have a family without a dad
With a mama crying, the kids is scared
9/11, why were we unprepared?
Mr. President, are you aware?
Unless you rich you have poor health care
Makes you scream and wanna pull out your hair
Discharged from hospitals as soon as you get there
Mr. President, truth or dare
Terrorists are hiding, and you know where
Illegal immigrants are everywhere
Is it really their fault, they wanted to come here
I respect you, please be clear
But talk with me, show the people you care
(Wyclef Jean)
What am I to do, have you wiggle any you
Tell me something that I just make sense
You sent us off to war, please be honest what it's for
Does it matter if it's life or death?
(LL Cool J)
I'm not Republican or Democrat
I'm independent and I want the facts
When are the soldiers coming back?
Are we prepared for a terror attack?
Late at night I watch CNN
It gets so bad, I might stop breathing
The Middle East hates us, what's the reason?
Mr. President, my heart is bleeding
Tuck my kids in every evening
Try to teach them to keep believing
Hoping my government won't deceive them
Tell 'em, touch your goals, you could achieve them
Mr. President, I have to know
If I die for you, what will I have to show
Will it really and truly help our country go?
I'm waiting for your answer, let me know"

Guan boy it's the champion Mr Smith
Your niggas couldn't raise up with a forklift
Cocked the hammer, peep out the grammar

Reach out for my blackness but your records ain't wack this
Your bitin on the castle door but when you fall in the moat

Let's get together and diss LL
Use his name and ya records might sell
I can't believe you found a dead maggots
Crawlin all over my name I won't have that

Why walk in quicksand?

I'm rippin emcees a funky drum with a big beat
Name the date and a or Rainer
Ya three year old ballerina
I can't believe the suckers try to throw-down
Whether you're new or older than old town
Just kick back I don't like a ?stagger wagger? psycho rap
You can't handle the format

Ruff or rugged all I need is a broom
If I slay the way they slay, punk play the pay

Plates of hot butter rolls, beat ya with balamey
Slap ya with salami 'cause when I get hot I get hot like pastrami

But you feel the thunder
You get cooked I'll knock out your tooth
We'll be fighting from lobby to the roof
You are on me like I wrote your dinnertime
Yo Marley (Whassup?) spill the time
(Nah man, just kick a little warmth)
Pass the brass knuckles then we break his jaw
When I'm on the microphone I want silence
Let KRS-One stop the violence
Ain't no rivals ain't no competition
Punk, I'm beatin' ya into submission
I'm gettin' busier than ever before
Never more will I'll slack I'ma keep it real raw
Eat ya up like a pack-jam
Video is poppin' over a Batman
Rippin you to shreds, tappin you on the head
Then leave the battle lookin' as happy as a newly wed

Save the peep and put it on law-away

127,My Rhyme Ain't Done,1987,Bigger And Deffer (1987),,LL Cool J,"The President woke and he called the Pope
The Pope climbed to heaven on a golden rope
P.S. the Lord raised Michaelangelo from the dead
So he can make a fresh painting of my head
Then I hung out with a king and a queen
And the queen put me down with her polo team
The way I scored points all around the clock
I had her daughter, the princess ridin' my jock
I knocked the freak off like a crazy retard
Then I took a little trip into a deck of cards
The diamond jack joker and the ace of spades
Was amazed at greater Cut Creator on the fade
Then I played cards with the queen of clubs
The queen of hearts with me cold fell in love
As for the queen of diamonds, she don't like men
Because you know that a diamond is a girl's best friend
The double-trouble spade was named the deuce
And the joker acted stupid, so we gave him the news
There was 52 cards, and I met everyone
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done
Then I took a trip to the center of the earth
I was kinda scared, so E-Love went first
I met these funny little people, they called 'em skeezers
So I held on to my wallet like Ebeneezer
Tight leather pants that'll make you grunt
Two nice soft things right up front
The center of the earth ain't got no crime
Just people bodyrockin to the L.L. rhyme
If you're kinda confused to what a skeezer is
It's just a girl who's on my jock 'cause I'm in showbiz
There was a whole lotta skeezers, I dogged everyone
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done
Woke up late one afternoon
Realized I was in the world of cartoons
He-Man told me he'd beat me up
Because he thought that I looked like Donald Duck
Then I hung out with Spiderman
He told me he was gonna start a comic strip band
The Incredible Hulk was gonna play the drums
Charlie Brown grabbed the guitar and started to strum
Snoopy tried to rock on the microphone
But Tom and Jerry both said he should leave it alone
Then I hung out with Mickey Mouse
He had two freaks, so we went to his house
Mickey's freak was ugly, but mine was def
So I knocked it off until there wasn't none left
They were cartoon characters, I met everyone
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done
Since I'm a good friend of father time
I'm not gettin' older as I say this rhyme
I was warmin the stove at the Alamo
Before Booth shot Lincoln I stole the show
I was down with George at the Delaware
But I wore a Kangol, not the fake white hair
Me and E-Love met Sitting Bull
We made a peace pipe, then we took a pull
Then he brought more leaves from a golden chest
You thought it was tobacco - the shit was cess
There was a lotta great men, and I met everyone
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done
11:33, I swear it's no sooner
I went inside my TV, I met The Honeymooners
Ralph wanted me to bust a couple of rhymes
But I had my eyes on Alice's behind
Norton came down right about that time
Lookin' in the frigde, so he could swine and dine
Then I said to myself, I should give 'em a taste
So I pulled the microphone out my black briefcase
Said, it ain't Bob Hope or Barry Manilow
Then I borrowed Norton's hat, 'cause I forgot my Kangol
Ralph said, ""I got a scheme, let me get to it""
""Norton, my pal,"" I said, ""Yo, don't even do it""
They were all Honeymooners, and I met everyone
That story is over, but my rhyme ain't done
Cause my tongue cuts sharp, I hit a note like a harp
Or a harmonica, Veronica, I do my part
In a bedroom with leg room I'm strong like a monsoon
Chilled in Maui-Waui and I carry a harpoon
Stopped at the isle that's Mali, 'cause we got ill
Wrote my name on a rock at the top of the hill
I searched for other ways, made love in caves
And I kicked the ill beats that make the natives raise
Now I'm gonna tell you what all this means
From Farmers Boulevard in St. Albans, Queens
There's a lyrical technician who came to play
Number one b-boy L.L. COOL J
All of this is just a story that I made up
Def lines I say on time with Cut Creator's cuts
Some of it's fiction, and some of it's fact
Not another common rap with a heavy drum track
A whole lotta rhymes, and I wrote everyone
That story is over, and my rhyme IS DONE

Nothing like the new love
Say hello to night stand, I'm a see you again
Baby your man's through, he don't understand you
Treat you like a dirty van dude, that he ran through
Never ever romantic, no incense or candles
Basically you're too much for him to handle
That's when I came through, baby my aim's too
Make you feel like every dream you ever had came true
Sometimes you know that sometimes you're an angel
Hand up and down, making sounds with your paingrells
You know my style, hitting from all angles
Staring at your arches while your flip flop stable
Nagging me, reminding me to remain true
I ain't going outside, I gotta stay in you
There's nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Thought she bonking, now you in my apartment
There's nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Say hello to night stand, I'm a see you again
Every time you ask me to get nasty
Chanel's my standard, no bitch you'll never outlast me
Free to be a bad girl even though you classy
Get behind closed doors, sweaty, be trashy
Scream all night till yo wind pipes rasby
You need a leading man, I'm a movie, cast me
Your ex gives me dirty looks when he pass me
See, that's what happens when you swagging on that
There's nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Thought she bonking, now you in my apartment
There's nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Say hello to night stand, I'm a see you again
Ain't nothing like a new love
Ain't nothing like a new love
There's nothing like the new love"

It's up to you! New York!
Neeew Yoooooork!
New Yoooooooooooork!
It ain't a movie
Ayo Suits!
Probably gon' want some pasta after this one ya'meen?
Not to Spicy
(Broadway sample w/ (LL Cool J))
New Yoooork!, New Yoooork!
The City that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!
New Yoooork!, New Yoooork!
The City that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!
(Cause sleep is the cousin of death)
Let me tell you what's up with all these New York cats
They got too rich and lost they grip on rap
They let the country boys take over the soundtrack
And blow the Superman kid straight off they back
Now everybody know where all the flavor is at
And if there's any drama, I'll be handlin' that
I gotta switch to singles and walk to fall back
Late-night conference calls and all that
Not the next Denzel, I'm the first LL
I remember where I came from, hot since day one
Queens in the building, I spank these children
For not seeing that I switch styles like chameleon
A lot of wanna-be kings but I'm the real one
All these cats playing dumb, they know the deal son
Use rap like caps, I will peal one
And ya reign is over nigga, here it come
New Yoooork!, New Yoooork!
The City that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!
(Cause sleep is the cousin of death)
Listen party people now here's the situation
All these cats is lyin' they have huge imaginations
Ain't freestyling, them niggas is free-basing
It's like a epidemic the beats they keep wasting
Feels like the 80's again, back to basics
Hit 'em with the raw shit, niggas is gon' chase it
And get addicted to how I spit it
I treat my beat like a blunt, lick and split it
My shit's wicked, fiends can't forget it
Take it in ya lungs, ya done, ya get lifted
Too many debates about what Mister Smith did
What can I say nigga? God's god I'm gifted
But I won't hit you with the same old money rap
Cause most of the money rappers need to give you ya money back
I'm just ya man next door, sharp hood cat
I want the crown back boy, ya don't deserve that!
New Yoooork!, New Yoooork!
The City that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!
(Cause sleep is the cousin of death)
Just when ya thought that I was calmin' down
I pulled a George Bush and I bombed the town
I got 'em runnin' for cover, ducking, running around
Like L's on the radio, ""wow how does it sound?""
Never been afraid to set it off on these clowns
Especially with all the hyped up trash they puttin' out
This is for the cats that consistently hold me down
Arguing in barbershops from Queens to Up-Town
I went to Hollywood and let 'em borrow the crown
But they got too cocky, I'm back to check these clowns
I dare one of y'all to disrespect me now
And I'll die before that happens so inject me now
And I'm the best period, fuck pound-for-pound
When shit gets serious, I rock the crown
Matter of fact, where my real niggas at?
I got you, New York is on my back
Lets Go!
New Yoooork!, New Yoooork!
The City that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!

Leanin dipped in rocks, pump the joint on the block
Behind the Dolce Gabbana shades, peepin the spots
Frostbit and I'm turnin' blue, that's why I'm so hot
Put the hustle down majorly and never get knocked
Who can grind for this? Momma taught me to swerve
Rent the presidential suite out, snatch ya bird
My motto is dough or die, peace sign in the sky
In the brand new 'lectric blue Bentley ridin' by
Hurt these clowns, anybody that want it
Let you borrow my crown, tell me why would you flaunt it?
Don't you know you can get it, have your wig-piece splitted
Meth asked me to spit it, see my coupes is kitted
And my minks is fitted, lyrically I'm sid-dick
Honey frontin when you around, I always hit it
The boss is home, regulatin on chrome
Tell Russell it's line one, LL's on the phone
Get off my niggy niggy nuts! (ha ha, ha ha-hah ha)

Paper stackin, daddy get it crackin'
Chains might be gold, the joints always platinum
(And rims) always chrome (jeans) always pressed
(Loot) always right (cut) always fresh
(Gear) always dipped (honey) always bangin'
(You hot?) Always, my niggy nuts always hangin'
Hold it down, rocks by the pound
The new 2002 b-boy sound
Hoes stand back, I'm shakin up the game
You shoulda never tried, to SLIDE in my lane
Guaranteed-to-blow-the-block-up
When-I-ease-this milky white drop up
Wanna bang ya, that's all you need to know
50 deep in Summer Jam, I closed the show
[Chorus] w/ variations

Nuts, y'all, baby - stay flowin!
Hit Big B, tell him bring the Mo' in (bring it in)
Uh - we rockin' to the rhythm (all night baby)
Uncut raw, what we give 'em
Hell yes - bounce to the music! (bounce)
When the joint come on, everybody lose it
(This year) leave the bar, hit the floor
Represent, let these clowns know who you are
When it's bangin' like this, why stop? (Why stop?)
Ask me why I pop Cris', why not? (Why not?)
The flow of the century
Got your Belve splashin to the melody, what you tellin' me?
This is fresh - till the day I die
Leavin' momma with a tear in her eye
You was frontin for a minute, now what?
You snapped when the joint dropped

131,Nitro,1989,Walking With A Panther (1989),,LL Cool J,"(LL Cool J)
Check this
I excel, they fell, I said - well, hell
L can yell or make 'em melt like gel
I signed the contracts that buils up stacks
Play the wall or fall I stand tall you're small in fact
Step aside, you might get fried
By the super technique that the rapper applied
As a matter of fact, the impact will distract
Your attention away, from the rest who say
They can mess with Cool J the best of today
And best cause the rhymes are so funky fresh
I'ma attack smack and make 'em stand back
Black strong as cognac I got the knack
To rhyme to the rhythm of this, and give 'em a gift
That's swift, other rappers are stiff and don't riff with
Mr. Smith, cause that ain't safe
I get you wide open like an uncut eighth
I write to fight, don't bite, to reach heights
The mic makes right, give me the spotlight
So I can prove the pen is mightier than the sword
LL hard as hell, the lyrical lord
The counterfeit misfits that rap had to admit that
My rhymes are so dangerous, I need a permit to rap
Solo, on the microphone
MC's -- don't let me catch you alone
I'm nitro!
Yo, I got the kick of a kettle drum, guaranteed to overcome
You're just a minimum, messin with the maximum
And when I swung my tongue among the high strung
Young MC's, they all got done by the legend
Every second I'm wreckin
Not a mistake you'll find, but you can keep checkin'
Out the sound you'll find that it's genuine
Bet that you'll rewind this a thousand times
You can taste the bass like it's filet-of-sole
I leave the microphone full of bullet holes
I drop the bomb like I'm in 'Nam and go beyond
The normal boundaries of too much harm
To MC's, but as they say please I freeze
Rhymes like these kill like a disease
Tried to fill my shoes, and caught the blues
Because they get bruised by the rhymes I choose
I kill rappers at random, I don't understand em
The ones I didn't get, are on a memorandum
Lines I recite are spontaneous
The nursery rhymes you write, are miscellaneous
So pass the crown, bow down and give in
I'm the Prince of Rap, that's how we livin'
Settin milestones on the microphone
Empires are overthrown, and I ain't even baritone
No joke I spoke then God stroke
As Job tried to sweat the style and got soaked
Conquered and killed on the microphone
MC's -- don't let me catch you alone
LL's nitro!
Nitro!
Yo, flammable -- like gasoline
Threatening -- like a guillotine
It's like a bad dream when you battle my team
I go to every extreme to make MC's scream
I'm clever, I last forever, we can do whatever
With whoever, whenever, I never
Ever got rocked, stopped or dropped
They got popped, by the hip-hop rock that I concoct
I'm so nice yo, flowin with the maestro
Murderin and hurtin' MC's because I'm nitro
The earthquakes'll kill snakes and fakes
You can't flake, you made a mistake, give me a break, thanks
Now that we're straight and that's clear
Watch all the big mouths - disappear
Disintergrate, deteriorate, fall
I demonstrate, and devestate you all
There's no doubt about the fact I turn it out, the wack
Be on the lookout, LL made a comeback
Full of power, I'ma devour
I stand tall as a tower, I won't allow a
MC to C-O-M-E, C-L-O-S-E
Play me long D-I-S-T-A-N-C-E, M-C's
On the microphone, I'm nitro!
Nitro!
Yo (funky)
I daze amaze faze blaze and beat 'em down
Nowadays they crave and praise, the funky sound I pound
Rhymes I write 'em in, recite 'em and then slide 'em in
Order to slaughter comp that start soon as I begin
Total domination, across the nation
Devestation, cut sensation, it's the invasion
Of L the Terrible, devastating rhymin wiz
I cut through through do and chew, you know what time it is
Slick, I get off of kicks, vick your flick
Hard as bricks, rock ya sick over the mix
The L, L, C, O, O -- L J Period now you know bro!

I know you had some problems but I'm here now
You'll never be alone long as I'm around
Good hearts don't belong in the lost and found
So I kick up the pieces, erase your frown
And I show my true colors when we paint the town
I hate to hear you cry, I don't like the sound
So my love is turned up, sheets get turned down
I know it hurts now, the drama's the worst now
It's forth in a hundred but love's a first down
A quarterback to come back right now
When a hail Mary works the world, it's like wow
You down for the count, I ain't having it baby
They can all go to hell, I know they callin me crazy
But you're my sunshine when the world gets shady
A toast to the first lady
You shouldn't be (you shouldn't be alone) alone (nah)

I used to be a Casanova in the lunch room line
That is more important things occupying my mind
Like being there for you, breathing the air for you
Keep trust false and truth to dare for you
The weight of the world I'm prepared to bear for you
The haters get cynical and call you spoiled
Not knowing about the drama in which you embroiled
The numerous pit falls, the tussle and the toil
The farmer still want me to put seeds in the soil
And here comes the harvest, this part's the hardest
I'm still here regardless
You shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone
I'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)
Love you know, I'm right here

R. Leslie on the track, uh, uh, uh
I told y'all that I would make a killing
I told y'all I blow like Mount St. Helen's
I told y'all I'm the truth, they paint me like a villain
Sick on paper, the inch to penicillin
I told y'all the real, they started catching feelings
Muthafuck 'em all, throw ya L's to the ceiling
Cool J, still hotter than a helicopter crashing in lava
Still sweeter to the ladies than a box of Godiva
Music industry is like a game of cops and robbers
Too many Indians, no chiefs to follow
What I'm sowing today, I be reaping tomorrow
So here's some joyful bars, to replace your sorrow
I'm beyond a legend, I'm iconic
Fall off, rebuild, your man's bionic
Put your trust in me, I never let you down
I always come up with a way to checkmate these clowns
I effeminate these clowns, trynna take me down
Ask Puffy and Nas, who 'hates me now'
The Phenomenon, ladies love the don
I give 'em an ear-gasm, they can't keep calm
(Chorus: LL Cool J)
Old school, new school, need to learn though
I burn baby burn like disco inferno
Old school, new school, need to learn though
I burn baby burn like disco inferno
I told y'all that I was coming back
I told y'all I ain't going out like that
I told y'all I was the greatest to ever rap
And I built Def Jam and took a piss on the map
I told y'all, I wasn't like them other cats
I'm fresh like a Wii, them niggas playing jacks
They all a bunch of a rats, they copying off 2Pac's stats
Wearing tuxedos to hide they tight speedo
Chains is tucked in, I'm incognito
Fuck with your ego, and touch your girl's labito
There will never be on flyer, LL Cool J
Taking you higher and higher
The wire, the GOAT, the grand sire
Who good at 24's if you want flat tires
Telling your soul and then performing with a choir
People, please, don't listen to these liars
Ladies and gentlemen, these niggas is selling you up
Bunch of irrelevant shit, it's not intelligent, is it?
My shit's exquisite, don't follow the yellow brick road
Them niggas faking like the Wizard
Is it really possible I'm this hot?
LL Cool J, still on top?
24 years, I ain't forget the block
You can ask my man Jay in the shop
Linden Boulevard, little Coupe, big rocks
Real estate only, I ain't fucking with the stocks
Why not, so our grandkids could feed they grandkids
And they grandkids, can feed they damn kids
And Collin Park throw ya hands in the air
Jump before I turn 'em in a Cool J affair
My word is my bond, every summer I'm there
Y'all can jump double dutch while I'm laying in the cut
I told y'all I wasn't giving up
I told y'all, I can jump on tracks and switch the rhythm up
Do work, treat rap like a ripped skirt
Sow it up, rep your hood, nigga, throw it up
You'd been standing by my side for years
Sold out concerts, screams and cheers
Front row T-Shirt, L, we here
I bought every album, too many to count 'em
Watch your movies, your the only good thing about 'em
Todd Smith jeans, I can't live without 'em
And the only thing I want from you

137,One Shot at Love,1989,Walking With A Panther (1989),,LL Cool J,"One shot
Oh lord
You know, it's gonna be a lot of negative things surroundin' you
Tryin' to pull you down
But what you have to remember is
It's up to you - it's your choice
You only get one shot in life
And you only get one shot at love
Did you ever notice - every time you fall in love
And it seems like you finally met the perfect match
Everything is perfect, it seems divine
But for some strange reason, there's always a catch
It's a one-way relationship, it hurts inside
One person smirks while the other one cries
Butterflies in the stomach of the one whose in love
It cuts like a knife, the truth mixed with lies
One shot (one shot at love..)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
That's all you get
Physical and mental, those are two different loves
Physical's a moment, mental is forever
If the physical fades and gets weak, all of a sudden
Remember, it's the mental love that keeps you together
You gotta be strong and endure the hard times
Cause af-ter hard times, good times, always follow
And when you're kissin' and huggin and makin' love
Treat that person like there's no tomorrow
One shot (one shot at love..)
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
That's all you get baby; one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)
One shot at love, one... shot... (one shot at love..)
That's all you get [sniff]
Jealousy - don't let it interfere
Don't let it come in between
The love you two share, cause jealousy's a hateful God
So merciless and mean
And it's only job in life, is to ruin relationships
And pit two people against, one another
And because of this God, the one you love so much
Will no longer be your lover
One shot (one shot at love..)

Just let me hold ya by ya shoulders then you can take it like that
I knew you was a champ girl got your leg on the dresser kickin' the lamp girl

Actin' like the L's can't bag 'em no more
Nightgown draggin on the heated marble floor
Flash Cartier when you open up the door - slide these on baby
So butter, still relate to the gutter
Just your lifestyle's different, spirit uplifted
Fell in love with a cat who's gifted
Turn you back to paradise, damn I missed it
Pop a bottle, light a purple candle
I got somethin' that you can't quite handle, that's why you love me
Pour bubbly, glow from the flame make your skin shine lovely

True love is so rare
But don't you worry I ain't goin' nowhere
Trust me, trust me, trust - me, baby

Then the man can achieve it; you gotta breathe it
And I breathe deep, I'm one with the universe
Minimum, ten percent go to God first
Lay back baby, close your eyes
Ice on the pinky finger froze your thighs
So much shade baby, the waterbed fries
Walk around nude in the suite yellin', ""Recognize!""
Do your dance, baby pour me a class

Said she love Tupac but hates some LL

She can take a prince, turn him into a king
I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites
Said her man get paper but he don't live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really wanna thug or do ya want love?
She gets the paper when it's time to get it on
She keeps these clowns thinking like Jack B. Quick
Honey smoke make you click, feel it in their throats
No joke all this love, let it stay broke out
Behind every playa is a true playette
Bounce you up, outta there, push and check
Taster's choice, have you nice and moist
Or play paper games or floss the rolls royce
Something like a phenomenon (repeat 8X)
(Uh huh) (go ahead daddy)
He was king of seduction, cop a suction
Now she was the cat that worked construction
Starve her with the paper, abuse the mind
Dis a new lover, when you know it's on mine
That's on top, lap dancin got to stop
You play out your chick cause your game is hot
I give you two, Italian, ice my whole crew
He's banging on my chest till it's black and blue
You beefin, yellin' on the cell of my 6
You reach it then you hear the cordless click
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'
Hell no, must be out Chicago
On your knees and your elbows each and every time
That's why I love you mami, you
Run your mouth though your legs over the bed baby
Work me out
Something like a phenomenon (repeat 8X)
(Uh huh) (go ahead daddy)
He was all souped up, but played it just right
Mami I was full blown, my game was air tight
I needed to switch up and get it in gear
It's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah
Keep it jinglin, no more minglin
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in
I'm sick and tired of the freakin, night to morn'
Moanin in the mirror with my cubans on
Let bygones be bygones, no more games
Hope all the chickenheads go up in flames
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back
Got it all figured out, mami I like that
Collect tips, cop his and her whips
The voice a quarter mil'-on, close the safe
But you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field
Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed

Pink cookies in a plastic bag, gettin' crushed by buildings

I'll take 30 electric chairs
And put'em in a classroom
30 MC's
And set'em free from their doom.
Just like a tomahawk cuts through the wind
When we begin
The wheel of furtune it spins
Holdin'
The rhythm like elastic
Moldin'
Your whole body like plastic
So why try to deny what ya already know ya love
Up above
Cause the mania
Hysteria
In the streets
While ya lovers gettin' merrier
In the sheets
I met this lady named
Sweet young thing and
She gave me that feelin'
That sunshine bring in.
Hordable
Sportable
Totally affordable
Silky smooth
Voice was real audible.
I said your cool as Ice Cuba

Drives me crazy.

Rub ya down with warm Ice-T
Make ya feel Bran Nubien
In-stant-ly.
Boogie Down
And check this Production.
Gimme them lips
They look good for suction.

Cool with a little almond joy
On the side
Just doin' the fly""

Comin' to my house
Turn on the lights
And see me on the couch.
I said, ""Do the jingle
And your from around the way.
I like your earrings

But anyway...
Your grand-daddy is
Here to spread cheer.
Somethin' nice and smooth
With my tongue in your ear.
Give me a snack
Some Salt And Pepper on a burger.

Taste of honey Kid
Ride in my Capri and
That's the joint
They got the real clear CD in.

Put together well

And have an oil well
Show and tell.

Belly to belly and
Chest to chest
Thigh by thigh
Leg by leg and

Of a freaky situation
With a peppermint twist

Nastified and all-funkified

Never fear
Whatcha hear.
What ya hear

And love ya big dear
And I will appear

With a beer
And bags full of cheer
And waterbed...

'Cause I rumble and groan.
She said, ""You got to be bad to
Make the moanie moan.""
Ain't no reason to front
On the way your life shown.
Booyaa!
How I'm jumpin' your bones
Like a Grand
Master in a Flash.
Put out your cigarette
And rest your tired ash.

So you can dig into the stash that I stacked up
But when my Queens niggas flashed, then you backed up
Keep my dogs fed, so they can shit when niggas act up

And the rappers you idolized, that idolized me
I walk in the spot, niggas part like the Red Sea
And Todd sharper horrors, we battle to the death

Battle anybody I don't care who you tell
I excel, they all fail
I'm gonna crack shells, Double-L must rock the bells
You've been waitin' and debatin' for oh so long
Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force
Symbolizin' in the rhymin' for the record of course
I'm a tower full of power with rain and hail
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail
Rock the bells
The king of crowd rockers finally is back
My voice is your choice as the hottest wax
True as a wizard, just a blizzard, who ain't taken no crap
I'm rhymin' and designin' with your girl in my lap
The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J
Cut Creator on the fader, my right-hand man
We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam
Rock the bells
Some girl's will like this jam and some girls won't
'Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells
All you washed up rappers wanna do this well
Rock the bells
Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot
He'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader
What's my d.j.'s name, Cut Creator
Now you know the episode who's on the wheels
He'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile
So precise with a slice that you know he's greater
What's my d.j.'s name, Cut Creator
Now you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed
I go to the store and get Old Gold
So all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back
Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked
Rock the bells
The bells are circulatin' like the blood in your veins
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name
Cut Creator's good, Cool J. is good-good
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever since
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be minced
Rock the bells
So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time
He'll cut the record in a second, make your d.j. look blind
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop
All you gonna-bes, wanna-bes, when will you learn
Wanna be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned
Six-g's for twenty minutes is the pay I earn
I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze
Do you like Michael Jackson, we like Cool J
That's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells
There's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well

I drop big bombs these bastards can't stop it (Hot shit)
I'm a profit for profit, once I decide to lock it
Fuckin' with me is toxic
Go prop on niggas love songs and rock shit
Show these motherfuckers how to spit they ain't about shit (This is it)
I'm so ruthless and cunning when the drummer was drumming
Y'all see I got your man running
LL the boss, like Luke wit the force
My techniques ugly, dirty like rugby
Drop jewels like Yoda my young students love me
All rappers are under not one of them above me
I rip shit, I blow the whole house down
On your big mouth clown
You don't wanna fuck around
Mic check
You are now Rocking wit the G.O.A.T.
Throw your hands in the air have a sip take a toke (Hot shit)
You are now Rocking wit the G.O.A.T.
Go 'head do your two step wit your hand in your coat nigga
You are now Rocking wit the G.O.A.T.
Throw your hands in the air try to wave away the smoke (That shit)
You are now Rocking wit the G.O.A.T.
Go 'head do your two step while I let these niggas know
(You better back down)
Listen good with both ears
Keep your mouth shut, fall back like broke chairs
How can they forget a nigga like me I'm so rare
You niggas had a pretty good run I don't care (So far)
So far ahead that I'm countin' in light years
That mean lightning strikes longer than your career
I'm so arrogant motherfuckers you like that, yeah
In your Club making rukus no momma wanna touch us (I'm a grown man)
Muff boys like Kobe at the Ruckers
Play Chris Tucker, Rush all you cocksukers
You way to lame, I showed you game
Just in case Y'all forgot my name
I'm the G-O-A-T., much hottest lately
Ripping motherfuckers since Cut-Creater tried to break beat
Farmers Blvd's is up in this bitch
And I help Russell hustle you could go ask Rick
The, the, the, the
(Monster) is back
They probably put a hit on me for murdering the track
They tried to shit on me they thought I wasn't coming back
They sealed the jar 'n' then they threw me in the back
Career means circles I came (back like) crack
I floated to the top, fully loaded on cock
'Cause the way ya motherfuckers his hot oven this hot he don't stop
These niggas wanna sell you the hype but don't cop
I'll give you the pure shot, I'm the L
Motherfuckin' L forever

For the last 10 years I so I loved 'em better
But I'm back you niggas get your shit together nigga

The odds 'r always wit me win I spin the wheel
And you could've rocked wit me but your not real
So when I polish off the plaque I'll let you know how it feels"

Lyrics:
Sippin something on the rocks
I got a shorty that makes the bed hop
I got plans to spoil you even though you saying stop
Ima drop that Phantom on you baby watch
Roberto Cavali and the Denali am I hot
Malibu beaches and Hydrofoil yachts
Badest Mercedes Lorenzos and silver fox

You want it hotter than we take it cross seas
Party jumping its bumping toking something in Belize
I know you want it sucker free

Take it easy player talking greasy player

Yellow canary, tennis bracelet necklace, knahmsayin?
Three quarter black mink; shades, canaries in both ears
Knahmsayin? Black Phantom, triple black, with the oak wood
Gucci shoes, that's how I play
(Verse One)
Hold up, I don't gamble, I don't play no craps
I was taught early on don't jeapordize the stacks
Before I open my mouth, I get all the facts
I could never fall off, it's too many hot tracks
I'm affiliated with too many hot cats
To end up, crawlin out of a hole in Iraq
Try to topple my regime
You end up in need of a scalpel to your spleen
Is there a medic on the scene?
Easy children, Queens is in the buildin
That blank look on your grill'll get filled in
Slow down baby, you actin' like a clown homes
You get your fronts remodeled like a brownstone
You hear my heat rock comin' through your sheetrock
It means you're OD'n homeboy, here come the detox
I get my swagger on, proud as a peacock
Bars is hot, beats is pumpin like a ? box
Shake it baby shake it
If you a real O.G. put your hands in the air with me, c'mon
Shake it baby shake it
Young ladies in the spot, if you came up in the place to rock, c'mon
Shake it baby shake it
Divided we fall, stay together and forever we ball, c'mon
Shake it baby shake it
You do it for the gangsters
I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby
(Verse Two)
They pay me so much it's hard for them to swallow
When you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds follow
Pay yourself first, that's one of my main mottos
Picture Bill Gates on the block dodgin hollows
I can't see it player that's beneath my vision
I'm beyond focused, every decision is made with precision
It seems like greed's the world religion
But L want cake, save the crumbs for the pidgeons
Black man, get the flies outcha eyes
You can't 'cause where you born but you affect where you die
Until that day, health and welfare, cheers
And after my wake, the hood'll talk, man listen here
He kept a mink and canaries in his ears
Like the Enterprise rollin' over stars for years
Spit bars for years, kept hot cars for years
The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years, uh-huh!
(Verse Three)
To be or not to be the man, that's the question
Got a vision in my mind, I can see that I'm destined
To lean up in the backseat, givin' directions
Sweep the block clean as November elections
On the Blackberry readin cash flow quadrant
Brim to the side, my gorillas is bonded
CLS Vision, four Hummers behind it
You forgot I'm from Queens? You can get reminded
I'm a man's man, when you chumps gon' learn
If you play with fire you get poured in a urn
You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm
All my albums is platinum, it's been confirmed
I'm more than a symbol of sex, I get respect
For livin' in the hills but still keepin' it mad real
Stay on course, the boss crush obstacles
You burnin me, two words: I'm-possible
(LL Cool J)
Like I said
Yellow canary tennis on the neck
Three quarter black mink
Gucci hat to the side, shades
Gucci shoes, baggy jeans
Black Phantom, oak wood
That's how I play
Yeah
(Shake it baby shake it)
You do it for the gangsters
I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby"

Yeah...
Smokin', dopin, keep your ears open
Put me on the flier and I'm guaranteed to rope in
Twenty-thousand people to the place that I play at
And have 'em even sayin' how could someone say that
They're as good as the man who just saw
[Scratched ""Cool J""] Please give me some more
Of those hoopin, scoopin, rhymes you be troopin
If you don't know the new dance, Patti Duke'n
Clap your hands, stomp your feet, snap your fingers
I'm snatchin airplay, from all you AIDS catchin singers
It's a, special delivery on your front step
My picture's on the cover and the rhymes are in effect
Cause, I love to lay down, joints for the playground
And have you OD'n sayin', y'know, J sound
Righteous, the brother did what he had to
I didn't talk about this, so I had you
Sleepin', breathin sayin' yo he ain't keepin'
His promise to astonish, from weekend to weekend
But here it is, the jam of all jams
And from this day forth, MC's are gettin' slammed
With the
Uh, aww yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aww yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aww yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aww yeah!
I'm the wise wizard of the microphone swingin' it
Here's a mean joint, all the hip-hoppers are singin' it
Doin' a dance in tight bike pants
So get up on it (HOE!) you'll only get one chance
To work out, the soreness in your muscles
Do your own thing, even the hustle
MC's I'ma torture, that's already known
But while I'm torturin them, I'ma leave you alone
So you can bump, grind, and rub up against your partner
And look wild like you're tryin' to get a part in a
Dirty movie on the hip-hop tip
Now tell me (tell you what?) that brother L ain't tryin' to flip
With the
Uh, aww yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aww yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aww yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aww yeah!
Movin, groovin, admit that you've been
Shocked and rocked and I'm on top and it's been proven
I'm self-reliant, on stage I'm defiant
All those rumors are small things to a giant
I'm not a cool calm, collected type of brother
I'm kind of hype that's why I'm a good lover
In bed I'm energetic, kind of like a freight train
Goin' so crazy I have the girlies sayin', ""Wait James!""
I do damage - use the beef to build a sandwich
And when I'm done, she'll be sayin', ""How did you manage
To make me feel pleasure from my toes to my head?
On top of that, you ran laps around the bed""
So bust out the pumped up funk that I'm revealin
And listen to it, while you're in your car wheelin
On on your Walkman as you're starin' at the ceiling
Or when you and your love is sex-appealin
To the
Uh, aww yeah, uh - ah
Uh, aww yeah, uh - ah
KnowhatI'msayin?
Uh, aww yeah, uh - ah
It's like a smooth joint, youknowhatImean?
Uh, aww yeah!
Real mellow, on the love tip, check it out

(Rap Verse 1)
First of all you a banger
Straight up and down
I'm seeing minks on your hangers
I know your mama told you don't talk to strangers
That leads to dangerous situations
But I can't be patient
You need communication, appreciation
Respecting your style instead of talking all wild
One smile you daydreaming of walking the aisle
In the water bed rolling around in the money pile
Baby my format is not to be a doormat
But I still pull your chair out at the table and all that
Touch your back softly whatever it cost me
Time, money, and energy
You will remember me
(Ne-Yo)
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger then this
(Enough is enough)
No more walkin' 'round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin over you
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio
(LL Cool J)
(Rap Verse 2)
Ima keep you equipped in all of the best whips
Pay attention to detail even your lipstick
Give compliments when your pedicures switch
When we're on the mattress you won't care if I'm rich
I'll love you deeply, whisper sweetly
Even when you critique me you could still reach me
Beats me why you sweeter than a peach be
One bite and love sugar for the whole night
You'll be aiight
You rolling with the elvis of rap
Come on move your pelvis and throw it back
I know it's forward and it sounds a little blunt
But love, money, respect, whatever
Pick what you want
(Ne-Yo)
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)
Said I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
Why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishin you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
Why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)
Why can't I turn off the radio?"

Let it ring
Love the ringtone, let it sing
Fall back under my wing
Let go of my mind, let it swing
Let 'em wait
Body language is how we communicate
I know it felt good, let it marinate
Multiple O's, increase your heart rate
So relax,
I put my lips on every inch of your back
Lookin' good, I got plans for that
It's my pleasure to fall into your trap
Love the world baby, I was running lately
I did a 1-80, crazy

Head in my lap
Massaging your ears, you like that
I bite your bottom lip, you bite back
I know it's good, I don't need you to tell me that
Kiss yo neck
Ignore the main spot getting wet
Pressure's built up high as it can get
So we flows like the pilot, press the jet
Let it stretch
For all the times you seduced me in the tracks
All the chasin I did so you can catch
Now all I do is shine and move back

Bottom out,
Kissing with your fingers in my mouth
I'm taking all different routes
Discovering the ins and the outs
You slide to the couch
I wanna see what that love seat is about
Work it till it looks like a pout
Too many climaxes to count
Love your world baby, yeah it was born lately
Did a 1-80, crazy
There's something about the way you do
The things you do
And when you do, oh tell me
I don't wanna go outside
I don't wanna go outside
I just wanna lay here with my arms around you night and day
I love the world, there's something about you

Runnin' from the streets and our beats - the sad sheets, uh
A sunny beach, video hoes within reach
Farmers Boulevard - liberty and forty is gone

Speedin on the highway
Starin' at the white lines we rollin', we rollin' (white lines)
(LL Cool J)
High speed baby!
It's two o'clock in the mornin, I'm stompin down on the pedal
Look at my ring on the steering wheel and my ice on the bezel
I made a promise to God that I would run from the devil
When the engine is gunnin I'm on a whole other level
White lines connected, I'm livin' life like a rebel
My competition is chokin inside my dust when it settle
Baby look at me now, I'm just a kid from the ghetto
But I'm on top of my hustle, I move the bass and the treble
And I go at your generation, I'm runnin' this era
Ain't no lookin' behind me, my system shakin the mirror
Top speed in the Beamer, my head boppin to ""Ether""
I'm on I-95, clutch burnin the reefer
Everybody that rides with me becomes a believer
'Cause I come from the hood, but I think like a Caesar
Went from 0 to 60, four deep in the Bentley
Hell yeah I be speedin, that's why niggaz resent me; ugh!
(LL Cool J)
Yeah, uh
I said to hell with the past, it's time to live for the future
Make the muffler backfire and pop like a Ruger
Don't have the slightest idea 'bout who you ridin' with do ya?
Just keep your eye on the white lines, feel 'em goin' through ya
Between the lines my mind works like a normal computer
My adrenaline's rushin like I've been dodgin the shooter
I get surgical on the road every line is a suture
And you must be a operator if niggaz dispute ya
Peelin off in a hurry, there ain't no reason to worry
Anybody that challenges me is gonna get buried
12 cylinders gunnin the whole world has become a
Grill low to the ground, like a bull when it's runnin'
My Lamborghini is hummin, it sings a tune to your woman
So if you make me slow down, I'm peelin off wit'cha onion
You need to stop all the frontin under your hood there ain't nothin'
You know the Exit is 13, come see if I'm bluffin
(LL Cool J)
Uh!
(Funkmaster Flex)
Exactly! When we in the car we 22'd up
When we in the big truck we 24'd up, y'knahmean?
When you see me ridin', real fast, your job, is to stay back
Pre-bumper - behind the bumper fam! All right?
Do not race in front of me
I should not be able to see, your license plate
That means there's somethin' wrong here
(LL Cool J)
This is the biggest decision I ever made in my life
You do a hundred miles an hour on the highway at night
You go to fasten your seatbelt and make sure that it's tight
Because I'm rippin the paws just like I'm rippin the mic
Baby I'm pushin the limits as if I'm racin a bike
Tell the highway patrol no need to chase me tonight
The way I'm doin' my thang it's like I'm up in a plane
I hit the stick in the rain, I guess I'm sick in the brain
Rocks hittin the frame, you think the shit is a game
But I'm ready for anybody that steps in my lane
And I know you afraid, no reason to be ashamed
Nobody's crashin my party I'm mashin out on these lames
I devoured the cowards and there is no doubt about it
All these niggaz are too gassed, they can't run without it
Tried to give me a flat tire, I wouldn't allow it
I left y'all in the dust nigga, I'm too high-powered!
(Funkmaster Flex)
Exactly! When you see us, fast lane middle lane slow lane
It's all the same thing y'knahmean? We go fast
We got a lot of big wheels on our cars, it's what we do

Yeah this one goes out to all the ladies in the house
(LL Cool J)
I need two to stand by me when the chips are down and
Stick around while I defend my crown and
No sell-out, the chip is too rough and
I'll blow your skin to sofa, leave your mind to be tough
And I might seem rough but life is much rougher
To see success sometimes you gotta suffer
I need a woman that's stronger than material needs
And isn't motivated by green
Dry my tear-drops and feelin' my pain and
Watchin' my back while I strive to maintain and
Makin' love like a medicine doctor
I knew that she was bad from the day that I clocked her
(Chorus: Dawn Greene)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
(LL Cool J)
My enemies come and my break-bread's tough but
You recognize game from your eyes and walkin'
Baby ain't no way I'll let the vultures attack you
So I'll teach you the game and tell you how to react to
The conversation, sexy vibration
Visual stimulation, slick persuasion
Times are hard, I need a woman that rolls by God
And the only man she loves is Todd
But will you be around when the raindrops fallin'
Or could it be you never loved me at all and
I need a trooper, a soldier, a agent
I need someone who can roll with my arrangement
The reap reducer factor and
The Queen of the Universe, not an actor and
Standin' by her man till the end
Not only as a lover but a friend
(Chorus: Dawn Greene)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby (yeah)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
(LL Cool J)
Man, do things get better?
We can look back at the whole aerators
Remember the times when they said I couldn't do it
But I was rougher than rough and baby you knew it and
You held back when your loved jobs called in
You had faith when they said they're not callin'
You understood that what we had was good
You stood by your man like a real queen should
That's why now I got you livin' your dream as
A beautiful wisdom, a part of my team and
As long as I live on this earth
Anything you want is what your loyalty's worth
(Chorus: Dawn Greene)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
(I wanna send this one out to all the ladies in the house)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby, (word)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man (peace)
You got to stand by your baby
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
You got to stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man"

Rippin the microphone
And blowin' the stage apart.

Shakin and breakin 'em down
Best at least
F***in 'em up up at least
Smackin 'em in a pilek
Now have a stomp and a smile G.
Raisin
Replacin

Machetti style
Choppin down
Their petty style's bassin

You're a slow trotter.
Karate
Switch the e into an a
And it's karata.

Chop off your legs
And make your head stand.
Tax and wreckin these chumps
All of them I rub out.

What's on your mind
You know I never go out.
I be breakin bouts
Ya boys
Your block is full of bums see.
You never was too clever
Stick the fork in you

The flow will smack ya.
Pumpin ya full a lead

Kickin it off in half the time
Takin' a break
And makin' mine
You're way behind.

And all the uncle
Made your title for ya
Hopin
And prayin'
And wishin

But I rip all a y'all
In half
Look at me laugh
Ya hee-haw style

Gimme the mic and hoodie
Now I'll dick it.
Any
The every
The his
The hers
Of those
Of theirs
Of them.
I see your title
Around your neck
Just swingin' loose
I take your gem.
I'm takin' it off you neck
With every line that I select
And rappin' it up and cuttin'
While I'm starin'
With disrespect.
Bustin' off
Yeah
Squeezin like a vice grip
Blowin' ya off the stage
Into the crowd
So have a nice trip.
I'm takin' control
I hold
The microphone is good as gold
Fly so many heads
I built my twenty-fifth
Totem pole.
Turnin' it out
And gettin' wrecked
Is just a understatement.
How special to rap a flat
Puttin' his head
Inside the pavement.
Burnin 'em up
Just like a flame thrower
Rippin 'em
With the cool flower.
Takin' 'em out in pairs
Like the man, Noah
Holdin' 'em up
Just like a trophy
For the world to see.
You really ain't superb
You see
You're goin' out
Like a girl to me.
Takin' your little
Boo-hoo baby
Tear drop
Cryin style
Breakin it down
Until there's dust
And I'ma vacuum up the pile.
Showin
And provin
And groovin
And makin' a movie
On the mic.
Slappin a Marlboro
In his mouth
Just like
A dirty little tyke.
Master of the murderous
Maniac
Mad style
Amazin man
Mackin the mic
Since I was just
A mere child.
Props and props
More props than Terminator 2
With pen and pad
I play to you
And on the cross-fader too.
Endlessly with energy
Undefeatable lyrically
Expandin my empire
You don't wanna test me.
Wizard of funkadelic
Every album's like a relic
Bite the line
Chewin on mine
But ya never live to tell it.
Bustin' it off quick
Flippin the script
That's in the bushes
Then walkin' around the jam
I'm handin out pounds
And mushes.
You're makin' a face
You wanna test my slick manuever?
Your best to rock a break beat
Or somethin' you can groove to.
Even if every rapper
In the world was makin' jams
As soon as I set this off
Their mic's are slidin
Out their hands.
Rockin' the junky's world
With the release
Of every single
Back in the days
I told ya
I need a beat
To make ya jingle.
Overlord
Droppin' the sword
And choppin off the mic cord.
Rappers are dead
All over the street
In every state I toured.
I'm dealin' the truth
With living god
That's right before ya eyes.
And I'll be rollin'
In hoods and sneakers
You can keep the suit and ties.
No sell out
Bet ya uncle never dies.
Gimme that microphone
I'll rip it up
Until sunrise"

For me to paint pictures on the walls of your mind
These quality masterpieces are hard to find
Swap from 6 to 9 to stand online
I feel like an underdog coming from behind
Pressure bus fights, relax, you'll be fine
Ll got the remedy intervention divine
I gave you the gift for missing me
It's all bout design
For your talking, (it's a privilege to be mine)
For your loving, (I put it all on the line)

Can you take it, (take it), take it, (take it), take it?
Let me love you babe, I won't make you wait
Can you take it, (take it), take it, (take it), take it?
Ignore the clock, it's time to make the bed rock
This hood, we don't even hear the sirens or gun shots
I'm stroking you're floating and what not
Skin sticky but no hickies, better knock
The tensions tie, I'm outside the box
I pin on your balloon without making it pop
It feels like New Year's but two balls drop
Almost at the top, now you begging me to stop

Can you take it, (take it), take it, (take it), take it?
Take a ride, look down in my eyes
Flooded like my chain I can drown in your thighs
A little bit of pain brings joy to your life
Lay your head back, relax and get right
Souls unified beneath the moonlight
It's only you and I, no other invites
I wanna see you naked, watch you take it
Come here... so are you
For your talking, (it's a privilege to be mine)
For your loving, (I put it all on the line)

But we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work
Be funky
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Cars ride by with the boomin systems)
(Cars ride by)
Funky
For all the cars out there
And all the brothers
That like to front in their rides
Check it out
You know it's funky, funky, funky 'cause you heard it from hear-say
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin when you're ridin' around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin 'cause your batteries drain
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
'Cause they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by
And the girls be on my jock 'cause my system's fly
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
'Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this
Mind your business
Now pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While I'm checkin' out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin, and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise - it's 3 o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin'
I'm steady hummin, I got the Funky Drummer drummin
My trunk be shakin, vibratin and rattlin
Pumpin so loud, all the shorties be battlin
A right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
'Cause I'm frontin in my ride and my word is bond
Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the o to the o to the l to the I to the n
To the f to the r to the o to the 'n' to the t to the I to the n
That means I'm chillin'
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cosy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say: I want bass
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin' up smilin', but you can't come close
'Cause my system is pumpin loud
Like Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops: you gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk
You know what I'm sayin'
Word
So next time you're in your ride pumpin it up
Just remember
It's Cool
Peace"

Lemme run it throguht this album, tell Spielberg ""Chill""
My jet hit LaGuardia six in the morn
They be waitin in the Bentley when the plane takes on
Straight to the studio dirty - no shower
Threw out 5 mics in the first half hour
Niggas know, who about to get all the dough (LL)
Who about to hit all your homes (LL)
Who about to spit all the flows
That's all I can say, and I can't stands no more (We know)
Aiight then, what the fuck the deal yo?
I's raised on some ill shit, let's be real
Uptown - the Bronx, and Brooklyn and Queens
Staten Island, Jersey, ya know the routine
East Coast - y'all want it, y'all got it
Look up in my eyes, a nigga feelin' psychotic
Look outside nigga, my cars excited
Look at the crowd, how they respond to my product
Like exstacy, my crew's next to me
It's my destiny, to make history
I'm the emperor - Rap King
>From the streets of Paris, up north to Sing-Sing
One question: Do I do my thing thing? (Hell Yeah)

Drop more platinum, to fo' mo' bills

Greatest of All Time, and that's all real
Ain't no reapper could do what I do
Rip ya whole label so low, no crew
Ain't a M C that I can't go throught
And I only have respect for a chosen few
But they could get it too
Trust me, you don't want L to spit at you
I'm the one they call when shit gets critical
The way I conquer the world is spiritual
I'm imperial
Everlasting, the best who ever did it
Holdin' the crown down, can't nobody get it
Germany, Italy, France, Japan
London, Africa, bow to The Master - The G.O.A.T.
LL Cool J is hard as..."

Stupid"
165,The Power of God,1990,Mama Said Knock You Out (1990),,LL Cool J,"Somethin' real smooth
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
We'll get into the groove
Power of God move
Somethin' real smooth
Somethin' you need to take heed to
A basehead cleaned up his act
He stopped smokin' crack and took his soul back
Decided, he could find a much better way to live
You know the way - positive
Without all the negative chemicals and drugs
Without all the hangin' with the envious thugs
Never before was a man so far behind
And came back to rule for a long time
Positive will explode when you light me
My enemies lurked, and they held the dagger tightly
Wanted to taste my blood, but they got scarred
When they felt the power of God
Wickedness got crushed when the Lord came
Down with the King, 'cause he's evil and vain
He doesn't understand the power of a ???
Doesn't realize I'm rollin' with a team
Avengin angels will come and burn
All those who saw, but refused to learn
He has no color, no shape, and no form
And like I told you before, I'm just gettin' warm
Get up, get down, get on it, it ain't that hard
You can feel the power of God
Money is small and the soul stands tall
All those who don't realize this, fall
The mind of a drunken fool is a useless tool
And it's cool to be in school
And overcome and overpower, but still uplift
Your mind is a gift
You're somebody, whether you know it or not
Outside the weather is hot
People walk around with their minds in a daze
Never take the time to stop and give praise
You're lucky to live in this world
Even the starvin boys and girls
Cause life is a gift in itself
And only certain people are blessed with good health
I'm Uncle L, but you can call me Todd
I can feel the power of God
Youknowmsayin
And G is the seventh letter made
Yeah
G is the seventh letter made
The power of God
Yeah
The babies, we gotta teach em, and hold em
Send 'em to school, so we can teach em, and mold em
Shape em, and make 'em take form
Cause their mind is like a ball of clay when it's wet and warm
Harmless and innocent
Until they're taught to be violent, and militant
This mentality gotta be erased by faith
The 12th hour is comin', we're close to the 8th
Get a chapter, and gain some knowledge
If not from the Bible or Koran, get a book from college
It's not about bein black or white
It's about everybody bein a right
I pulled out my mic, and the devil got hit hard
He felt the power of God
And G is the seventh letter made
Power of god
G is the seventh letter made
That was just a word to the wise
Uprise
'Cause we definitely gotta unify
And we need unity in times like these
We got to stick together
'Cause we as a people
All people
Gotta make it to the promised land
Peace"
166,This Is Ring Tone M...,2008,Exit 13 (2008),,LL Cool J,"(Chorus: Grandmaster Caz (LL Cool J))
Clap ya hands and to the beat, y'all
Because the heat'll make you, clap ya hands and say
You go the one for the cash, two for the safe
(This is ring tone murder) Let's dog the place
(LL Cool J)
My bars are like a bullet, blow your head right off
Hate on the trigger, pull it, give your mouth a night off
Give your sound man a c-note to cut your mic off
The promoters need me, nigga, you just a write-off
After that, hit the dress room, turn the lights off
Score on the fourth broad, let her break my pipe off
I used the word 'off' seven times in a rhyme
You dumb enough to think I got a limited mind
But before you start tweaking, critiquing, pressing rewind
Einstein understand, that your third eye's blind
You lack creativity, that's why you don't sign
They calling me a genius, it's about time
I'm like the tattoos on your mama's behind
I bounce up and down, and at the end I'mma sign
And I will humiliate anybody that want it
I'm back on stop, it hurts little homey, don't it?
(LL Cool J)
It's obvious these clowns don't know who I am
Most who didn't get the message, nigga, check the spam
Get your facts right, take your dick out your hand
No homo, but you probably on the low-low, damn
They call Uncle L, I'm from the north side of Queens
Now you looking at me, like what does that mean
It means I crush you and every coward in between
For sounding like girls with them sweet sixteens
And I don't give a fuck about who's old or young
From what I hear, the graveyard got room for everyone
Test Big Ellie, come and get your head sprung
Which coffin you want, the blue or the red one?
I ain't gang banging, that ain't the muthafuckin' point
The point is, I spark these niggas like dust joints
The point is you gon' pay me what you owe me plus points
Listen to the sound of revenge, it's my voice
(LL Cool J)
Run around talking bout I'm twice ya age
But I was rich at 17, you got some shit to explain
Rap game's like a movie, niggas playing the role
But your poker game's too weak, you're forced to fold
All this hating and debating shit, made me cold
Ready to blast, separate ya body from your soul
Conniving ass cowards get dropped in a hole
These niggas is shook like Pinky's ass on the pole
I'm the bridge over troubled water, pay my toll
I'm the rules to the game, you obey my code
I'm the center of the bomb, I'm the part that explodes
You are not hip hop, nigga, go write for Vogue
You are not a king nor prince, you just a toad
You ain't a G, you a hoe, you sweeter than Rocky Road
Battle anybody, who want it? Let me know
I just had another birthday, nigga, more dough"
167,This Is Us,2000,G.O.A.T.: Greatest Of All Time (2000),,LL Cool J,"(LL Cool J) (Thomas harmonizing in background)
I'ma give all y'all somethin', word up
Word up - all my live cats out there gonna love me for this one
Uh-huh... they gon' be like,
""Yo you, you need to listen to that joint L made""
Heh-heh... word up
That's the joint you gotta listen to, y'knahmean?
Check this out y'all
I got the key that fits the lock of a real dog's mind B
The answer to the question chicks ask most the time see
Why my man cheat and give some bitch my heat?
Slap me one day then Sunday he's so sweet?
To me and mine, this nigga's hard to define
'Cause he beefin when he broke but he arrogant when he shine
It fucks you up, you wonder if you wastin time
Mention marriage, he lit a Dutch and peeped out the blinds
What different niggaz feels in they hearts is scary
I used to say shit like,
""C'mon baby, you should be honored to share me""
She used to throw the cakes up, plus the burger was hairy
I used to have to think of shit to keep 'em comin', you niggaz feel me?
Baby or no baby I wasn't loyal or nuttin
Just me and my niggaz on tour, frontin and hittin somethin'
Red lipstick prints all over my drawers
Oh you wanna be an actress huh? Well my movie's hardcore
Like Dungeons and Dragons; gettin' brains in a Benz wagon
Step out, jeans saggin, crew laughin'
Gettin' blazed by the fiend for ten bones a piece
Nuttin but the dog in me needin to be released
This is us
(Chorus: Carl Thomas)
You know that I do, the best that I can
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more
I try to please you, and be your man
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more
(LL Cool J)
The flipside of the coin, what team you wanna join?
You in The Tunnel every Sunday exposin your tenderloins
In every rap cat's face, with some ol' flirty shit to say
Need to go home, wash your kids up, and put your tits away
Me and my clique in motion, champagne and Alize
Got your mind bubblin crazy, wanna flip Cool J
Spend your last on your hairdo, but you ain't save a dime
To put your child through college baby, now have you?
Go get a job interview, your bad-ass kids a curfew
And skip that ""Bills Bills"" shit broads is goin' through
I know this prostitute who said that life ain't cute
Child born with a destiny only God can dispute
Players giggle and laugh, flashin gats and cash
My dogs don't care about you Boo, they like your ass
Told me if I call and your man answer, ask for L
So he can say, ""No L live here,"" our code is ill
Tell him you about to catch a flick with Sherell
Plottin and schemin in the shower, masturbatin on the cell
The neighborhood hustler, that cat we all know
That nigga we grew up with, son from next do'
My dream was to flow and escape the hell below
But the demons in my life set fire to my dough
I thought about murder, I vowed my revenge
Like the devil's pumpin hate through my heart with a syringe
This is us
(LL Cool J)
They say a man gon' be a man, but that's only half the scenario
You nag a cat, you givin' him a license to fuck a hoe
When a man come home late, he want his girl to say hello
Not hear all that bullshit, bout, ""Nigga where you go?""
Fried chicken ready, t-shirt and panties at the stove
Messages written down, blunt rolled ready to go
Give me a hug, not too long, give me space
When a cat got issues don't need you all up in his face
Rub your breasts, kick back, smile a little
If it's rainin outside, chill, listen to the drizzle
Now kiss my chest, call me Superman
Pull down my boxers by the Calvin Klein band
(?) Wash it, enjoy the flavor, I return the favor
This behavior, should save ya
From me all night freakin, with a nineteen year-old
Half naked Puerto Rican, creamy ass leakin
Every man will agree, when she nag it's killin' me
I don't always wanna talk about how the world is shittin on me
I sip some Alize and meditate the pain away
And get in my own zone where I wanna be alone for solo
Reminisce with photos
And missed opportunities to make some dough flow, you know?
Chill, relax baby, support me from the background
Believe in my dreams, instead, you and your girls sat 'round
Complain about, who's tradin ass for cash
If there ain't no trust then just us can't last
This is us, I know you feelin' that
Think about that shit, word up
(Carl Thomas)
Your man, your man, your man
Everything we've been through yeah
All the places we've been yeah
Just don't know if I'll be the same again, ha
Ever since you walked all all over me, ha
And even if we bring this back together, ha
You know it won't be the same, no no no no
No no no no no, ha
Oh I, I, baby I, tried to be your man
Whoahoahhoh, oh yeah
Hoo hoo hoo
Can't you hear meee? Can't you hear meee?
Whoa..."

L! Who bring you the hotness?
L! Yo, you don't wanna start with
L! Forever keepin' it locked
It's now time to rock with - L! - throw your L's up
(LL Cool J)
Don't ever underestimate the Jack the Ripper
Be clear, every time he reappears, it's sicker
Listen here, the mind expanded, the vision is slicker
I'm long range like a miss-ile, many styles to getcha
Tear ya out the frame so the hood can get the picture
But I'd rather break bread, kick knowledge and get some money witcha
I'm willin' and able, to smooth pounds out like Witch Hazel
The legend is real, I'm not a fable
Captivated the screen, I'm Queens' Clark Gable
If it ain't a joint, bet your label, don't put it on the table
I'm out for the moolah, throw better hooks than David Tua
Who's the nicest? (L, YOU ARE!)
(Chorus - repeat 2X)
(LL Cool J)
You don't want it with L, b'ship cats'll get banged out
Put your flow throw a filter boy - shake the old slang out
23's in the building, watch my tongue hang out
Makin' MC's scatter like multiple shots rang out
Day one since I came out, they can't put the flame out
My temp seizin, perfect reason to blow the game out
Skatin off in the Navi, naw baby you can't have me
But I know cats will pay for that 'n' lace ya - yeah, gladly
Warning, young rappers, you don't want a career?
Y'all wanna keep goin' platinum, y'all don't wanna disappear?
Stop boppin backstage like you causin me fear
Cause you startin to get on my nerves, and that's a problem
The vet's in here
(Chorus - repeat 2X)
(LL Cool J)
Tension on the mic, halftime highlights
L Boogie bangin' on 'em, jumpin' through the skylight
You stand corrected, I'm hot, so get it riddight
I'm just spittin', when the middick is gripped, I spit it tiddight
Aight? Oh, these various rappers is so hilarious
Who put the mic down but y'all ain't qualified to carry this
Your, tracks are garbage and bars are miscellaneous
So, throwin' your joint at my car was spontaneous
Oh! I can't take it, why, must they fake it
Flows is fully dressed, yours is butt naked
Forever I will be, the one they came to see
Blowin' mics in half baby, who else could it be but
(Chorus - repeat 4X)
(LL Cool J)
Uh, I'm so hot (yeah)
We so hot (yeah)
Uh, uh, you so hot (I'm so hot)
Uh, uh, feel it hot (yeah)
Uh, uh, are you hot (you make me hot)
Uh, uh, I know I'm hot (ooh)

(To da break of dawn)
All my sex involved
As we get funky
Rhymes so bizarre
Everybody knows
When it come to a situation like this
Little more effects
And I can't resist
So we get funky in the house
Youknowmsayin?
L.L. Cool J style
What?
This ain't on a pop tip
Check it out
(VERSE 1 ] [ dissing Kool Moe Dee)
What is a panther? A animal that kills
I'm like a shark with blood comin' out the gills
You could never in your wildest dreams
Get a piece of this gangsta lean straight from Queens
Strong as liquor, to be seen in a limousine
Now you're gettin' done without Vaseline
Wouldn't bite because your rhymes are puppy chow
Made another million, so competators bow
Homeboy, hold on, my rhymes are so strong
Nothing could go wrong, so why do you prolong
Songs that ain't strong, brother, you're dead wrong
And got the nerve to have them Star Trek shades on
Ha, you can't handle the whole weight
Skin needs lotion, teeth need Colgate
Wise up, you little burnt up French fry
I'm that type of guy
And I slammed you know, just like a sumo
Put him in pampers, leave my drawers in his hamper
When I'm through, you need a brand-new identity
I was scoopin girls before you lost your virginity
Your jam is just a dreamin' MC scheme
Gettin' crushed by a L.L. theme
Somethin' like Shaft, put you in a cask' - bo!
You little blood-clot boy, you must not know
The rep I keep, the MC's I peep, sweep, play cheap
And freak with a chic unique technique
Get rid of the yukmouth smile
Cause brother, you ain't got no style
Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah
Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
Hey yo, that's kinda funky
But check this out here
(Rock that shit)
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah...
(VERSE 2 ] [ dissing M.C. Hammer)
Immaculate styles I use to abuse
MC's, so light the fuse
And spread the news, you lose
To the damager, microphone manager
Cold crush and bruise and bandage a amateur
That amateur swingin' a hammer
>From a body bag, so run and get your camera
Get a flick of the stiff dead-shot to get swift
But I'm the wrong brother to dance with
'Cause I don't need a partner to swing
Keep your eyes on the Cool J ring
Shootin the gift, but you just don't shoot it right
You couldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
Wouldn't throw a rock in a ghost town
So don't try to play post, clown
You know the L.L.'s back in town
And all the wanna-be sherrifs is gettin' shot down
(Shot) Gimme that microphone
I'ma show you the real meaning of the danger zone
Stop dancin, get to walkin'
Shut your old mouth when young folks is talkin'
Huh, you little snake in the grass
You swing a hammer, but you couldn't break a glass
Gimme a lighter - woof!
Now you're cut loose
>From that jherri curl juice
Cool J is back on the map
And when I see ya, I'ma give you a slap
That's right, a little kick for that crap
Cause my old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap
Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah
(To da break of dawn)
Funk it up
I said keep on
(To da break of dawn)
(Yo, rock that shit)
(To da break of dawn)
Check this out
Yeah...
(VERSE 3 ] [ dissing Ice-T)
How dare you stand beside me
I'm Cool, I freeze I-c-e
On your trail and I'ma cut that bull tail
You're disobedient with the wrong ingredients
But I'ma drink you down over the rocks
While I freak on your album cover jocks
You're gonna hear a real ill paragraph soon
I took the cover right home to the bathroom
In the immortal words of L.L., 'hard as hell'
Your broad wears it well
She's the reason that your record sold a few copies
But your rhymes are sloppy
Like Oscar, and you're bound to get dropped
And stopped, I ain't Murray the cop
Nor am I Felix, but I got a bag of tricks
Mr. Pusherman, gimme a fix
So I can show you I'm immune to them romper room tunes
You little hip-hop racoon
I'm not Scarface, but I want more beef
Before you rapped you was a downtown car thief
Workin in a parking lot
A brother with a perm deserves to get burned
So tell me how you like your coat cream?
On a cone, in a bowl, or in a wet dream?
With your TV on channel fuzz
Uncle L, that's how much damage he does
Here's 5 dollars, catch a taxi cab
Take your rhymes around the corner to the rap rehab
Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah
(To da break of dawn)
I say keep on
(To da break of dawn)
Just wanted to funk it up a little bit
My man Pete Rock is up in the crib
Youknowmsayin
Over here at Marley Marl house
Just coolin out
My man Clash in the house
Sippin on this Bartles and Jaymes premium piece flavor out the cooler
Loungin back
Keep on

(Well, we are Todd) I don't think so
You should have a listen to me right now
(LL Cool J)
I can feel it now baby I can feel it now, I can feel that
Even though you're a queen and I'm only a prince
I felt the magical between us ever since
The first time that I laid eyes on you
I want you to be my girl, so I can hold you
Caress you and let you know that I love you
And day by day my love grows
Heres' where I stand, I gotta be your man

173,Ur Only a Customer,2008,Exit 13 (2008),,LL Cool J,"It's all real talk baby
No question, uh
When I do, what I do, there's no competition
I'm number one, uh, you're only a customer
When it comes to the paper we chasin
Homey I stay with some - when you walkin' in the presence of hustlers
When the whips come out, you know just what I'm 'bout
I'm havin' fun, uh, you're only a customer
And the ice that I rock is oh so hot
You should get you some - when you walkin' in the presence of hustlers
First of all, I switched the protocol
Been teachin 'em how to ball since Mike went ""Off the Wall""
And furthermore, I'm a hustler to the core
I give you what you need, proceed to keep it raw
Your choice, you can live or die, either or
Have them candles and flowers by that bodega store
Life's about choices so choose homeboy
50 told me L, time to bring out the toys
So it's Lambs and Maseratis, hotties with hard bodies
Ridin' on Ducatis, toast to afterparty poppin'
Cause my joint's rockin', all the heads boppin
You know the apple's ridin', that's why the D's watchin
I rock from party to party, backyard to yard
Ask around God~! They tell you L goin' hard
I got my mojo back, I'm seein mo' dough black
My face on promo wraps, I'm seein fo' mo' plaques
The way the paper stack, I'm okay with that
She's so smart in my lap, she's a brainiac
We roll around in the sack, laugh and spillin the 'gnac
I'm the dog killin' the cat, ignorin the jack
This is flawless rap, you can't call this whack
Where the ballers at? Go 'head, throw up a stack
This is simply facts, I got the gift to mack
I take this to the max, what'chu know about that?"
174,Wanna Get Paid,1997,Phenomenon (1997),,LL Cool J,"(Intro: LL Cool J & The Lost Boyz)
No question about it
Queens represent!
EEEEUUUuuh!
Uh! say what?
Queens represent!
Yeah!
Come on!
Get down baby, down down down down down now!
Queens represent!
Are you down now
Lost Boyz, LL Cool J
Are ya's down now
(Chorus: The Lost Boyz)
You wanna get paid? You wanna get laid?
Pimp Yearlings in 360 ways
Live your life in an ill real way
Got 6 rides in your little drive-way
You get mad puff-lie all day
Make plans with your crime family
Get money money, take money money
Get money money, take money money
(Verse One: LL Cool J)
By age 19 Tyheim is turned out
He ain't talking much, keep a dutch in his mouth
Cop the aberrettes
Orange and Blue
Laced the Gore-tex, stepped with his crew
Black superstar, Jesus piece
Who he prayin' to? God or the Beast
Some bust blocks, feared on the block
Traded in the trucks for a silver drop top
Drug money flowin' ...
Jealousy is growin' ...
Paranoia got him second guessin'
D-T's on his back got him stressin'
He was at the light blazin' up traum
Around the corner came a tinted out Yukon
Ten slugs in the door made him fall
Guess he should have never hustled at all
(Verse two: LL Cool J)
My man Tay-Kwan like the chicks alot
Even when he hustled he kept them in his spot
He liked to fuck alot and make the rubber pop
5 baby mothers
1 live on my block
Shinin' in the club
Chickens showin' love
Cash bubblin' from pimpin' and drugs
He a real pretty cat
He get from his moms
Back in the seventies, she was the bomb
His games top notch, and he don't stop
He hit a reverends daughter in a church parkin' lot
Tay-Kwan is sick, heartless with chicks
He liked to beat 'em up, make 'em suck dick
Met a little shorty, brought her back to Queens
Honey got the virus, you know the routine
Not only did he walk away with the HIV
Her man's jealous, jooked him rediculously
(Verse Three: LL Cool J)
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Yolanda's alway's got a sceam
Credit cards in ATM machines
Used to make coats, holdin' work got arrest
Honey made sons pockets bleed to death
She a vet, yet she look innocent and sweet
When she wet, ain't no controllin' the heat
For baguettes she give love to ill thugs
Age of 15 she learned to pump drugs
Then she got pregnant, abandoned the kid
Met this drug kid, set him up and slid
Now she 23 full blown in the mix
Sizin' up wits than more cliques is gettin' chips
She down for whatever, as long as it pays
She tipped off the kids and got Tyheim blazed
She was in the same Yukon, laughin' with the thug
He said thanks for settin' Tyheim up
Take a slug
(Outro: LL, The Lost Boyz)
Get paid mommy, come on, come on
Get paid daddy, come on, come on [repeat 4x]
The Lost Boyz:
Nigga's they wellin' they just don't know
It be LL and 83rd rockin' the show
Now nigga's they front, they just don't know
But nigga's wanna stick they ball in that hole

175,We Came to Party,2013,Authentic (2013),,LL Cool J,"I just wanna make sweet love to you, baby, you know what I'm saying?
I just wanna touch you all over... aw, please!
We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
We came to party, we came to party
Hey look, I've got my hands all on your body
Ain't no problem, I'm on it - oldest man in the club
Also one of the richest, a hundred bottles of bub
It's just me and the Russians, we get all of the love
They was aware of the image, they wanna see what he does
TMZ in my face, Oprah all on my couch
Now I'm hosting the Grammys, what is this all about?
International baller, I must admit I had doubts
If they wasn't callin' me back, they was callin' me out
Game moved to the South, I just closed my mouth
Intellect like Belichick when he be switching the routes
I'm too old for the games, no time for the lames
Next challenge? Get this generation screaming my name
Who could do what I did? Boy, I must be the shit
Waved 106 and Park to play date with the kids
People texting my wife, tryna ruin my night
So I help 'em mind they business with some bottles on ice
Destruction in the club
Oh, no... Big Snoop Dogg
Ice so cold you can see it through the fog
To walk in my shoes it'll be a little jog
And if you step by the pockets, you gon' be up in the morgue
The peoples is peepin', peepin'
The bitches is dippin', dippin'
So this is the mission, listen, I turn this shit up
It's the party-rocking, nonstopping, four-hopping, rip and rock
Drippin' in this motherfucker, burn up, now turn up!
We ain't flirtin', we talkin' - we ain't dancin', we walkin'
Teenagers is pointin', couple cougars are hawkin'
I don't come here that often, but it's totally awesome
When you livin' for real, I don't consider it flossin'
Panty lines are crossin', I'm proceedin' with caution
I don't shit where I eat, gotta manage your portions
LL Cool J, I'm like the old-school orphan
Representing alone, sittin' on factory chrome
Shades on, in the zone - Kool Aid smile on my face
My security's strapped, ain't no beef, just in case
Me and my man Rich Whites, we in Vegas tonight
Claudine on the celly, make sure that money is right
Red carpet and tuxes, always where the bucks is
Paparazzi are snapping, I can't believe this is happening
Frustrating the haters, they're so sick of me rapping
I'm enjoying your blog, I've got the same type of passion
Fatman Scoop, Maserati Cool J
They ain't think I can do it, that's why I had to debut it
And let the critics review it, that way I spit and it's Buicks
Since the beginning, I knew it - rollin' an L in the Buick
Had the guts to pursue it, that's how a legend should do it"
176,We Rollin',2008,Exit 13 (2008),,LL Cool J,"Ha ha ha!

They love this
Just sit back and relax, Bentley seats in the back
Lil' momma we rollin' (WE ROLLIN', WE ROLLIN')
Candy paint on the 'llac, shoes bigger than Shaq
Chrome beamin we rollin' (WE ROLLIN', WE ROLLIN')
Picture a scene from The Mack, picture me on it like that
Quick get in, we rollin' (WE ROLLIN', WE ROLLIN')
Yeah I rap and I act, God could be where I'm at
Lil' momma we rollin' (WE ROLLIN', WE ROLLIN')
The P-I-M-P, the pockets are filled deep
The cars are sick B, the bars is milky
He hard to kill G, the God is real deep
The Coupe Deville leanin, pinky ring freezin
Creep with no ceiling, keep the chrome beamin
Cold with no feelings, rollin', dough pealin
Cruise the track, candy paint on the 'llac
Shoes bigger than Shaq, lil' momma relax
What he wearin on his back, is never off the rack
Todd Smith custom, all the ladies lust him
They with him, he crush them, we talkin' 'bout a mack
A purebred dog, not one of them alley cats
Thorough to the max, Q-boro matter fact
Ice so sharp it slice through your cataracts
Hard from the wars, he tough as a battleaxe
Don't hate him 'cause he hot, God put him where he at
Fo' sho'!
Truly got the bottles on chill, the models lookin' ill
V.I.P. locked down, crackin' them hundred dollar bills
Yankee hat low, Todd Smith the rhinestones
Your chick chose him, let him bygones be bygones
All these, amateur macks with they eyeballs watery
Choosin' honies over money that's how the order be
Meanwhile he gets his statements quarterly
Your starvin on the corner actin' drunk and disorderly
Relax in the Maybach, gettin' your booze on
Seats is like a couch, get your Tom Cruise on
French pedicure with the Jimmy Chu's on
He wanna see more he throw somethin' smooth on
The modern day Goldie, game better than Kobe
Style dope than codeine, playin' for his own team
When he walk up in the spot, he lookin' so clean
Rubbin money in your face like cold cream
Yeah yeah..."

Oh, I do believe that we will make it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh uh
I was at rock bottom, my whole life was mo' problems
Reincarnation of a slave pickin' cotton
Stress beamin down like the sun I felt rotten
To the core, was at war, cause the enemy is plottin
I hear him knockin', sayin' that we got him
Hot like solar, he wanna burn my soul up
World on my shoulders but I roll back ya boulders
Words have a funny way of comin' back to scold ya
Watch what come out of your mouth, you crack a molar
I tried to told ya, hehehe
Enemies gunnin, true believers ain't runnin'
Or duckin, we ain't scared of nuttin, ya feel me?
They wanna test me and press my buttons, oh really?
Allow Uncle L to hip y'all to somethin', uh, uh
Yeah, uh, check it out
There's a living power, make a man out a coward
Rebuild your strength like the new Trade Towers
I thought that I was over, my life got devoured
Now I'm on top and I pray for all the doubters
Time to shout it, sing it louder

Yeah, we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it (we're gonna make it)
Thank God we made it (yeah)
And I mean it, yeah yeah, oh yeah

I was feelin' like my whole world was spinnin and spillin
On the ground and that God wasn't willin'
It seemed like the only ones ballin was the villains
Dollar signs in they eyes, lyin' to our chill'un
I wanna kill 'em, I'd rather God hit 'em
They sellin venom and we buyin it like denim
These world wide webs they weave, we caught in 'em
Old folks is dyin' and CEO's skimmin
The bat's in your hand and this is the 9th inning
Keep your eyes on the ball when you swingin'
Don't be confused, don't be fooled by the wind-up
Start switchin your position, make your mind up
Pull your bootstraps tight, get your grind up
Get your life lined up before time's up
Yo, yo, you know what?
Take ten percent of that, dough you tryin' to stack
Send it up to God, I guarantee he send it back
Multiply it by a hundred times, y'all remember that
That's just a little jewel to get the monkey off your back
Uh, yeah, sing it out now
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
(LL Cool J)
In the darkest valley, through the loneliest alley
Never give up, press on through the storm
Weepin man fall, for the night seem long
But if you stand strong joy come within the morn'
And it goes, on and on and on and on and on and-ah
I know it feels like your back's to the wall
Who's sittin' in the crib, and you don't know who to call
(Jesus!) Hangin' on a tight rope, fingers slippin off
But you ain't by yourself dawg, we all been lost
Stay on your course, carry your cross
Ain't no stoppin', got to keep it poppin'
You want it, you can get it, believe me the king did it
Nothin' gonna hold you back, there's no limits
I'm sent to bring truth to rap, not gimmicks
And I'm not finished, man listen
Here's the moral to the thesis, y'all cats need Jesus
He put your life back together, pick up the pieces
Word to the masses, I heard God asked us
For less fake rappers, and more real pastors
Uh-huh, uh-huh, so hereafter
[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad libs

We made it, we made it
Through the storm and rain, yeah

Your boy's going big these days, didn't even see?
The hell with the devil, there's no sympathy
The wishes in my past are still ridin' me
All I can do is laugh as they lie to me
You can't take my God from inside of me
Crosses up, light up the sky with me
I got a lot of crazy crazy on my mind
Like what's the real reason that the pope resigned?
I got Van Halen, I don't need a bassline
I knew we can do it, it was just a matter of time
Put the axels back on the street and break on the vine
I came back to take back everything that was mine
If I live to be 1-0-9 I'm still in my prime
If I don't then I don't, I'll live on in your mind

Speakers under the stage, lift you off of the floor
Why? This music is the end to the war
We endure, cameras everywhere, everyone is keeping score
Everybody talkin' bout what's up 'bout the tour
The world is a steak, I'm a chew it up raw
We're back in heavy metal like we above the law
London, Japan, Germany and France
Lisbon to New York, we're live up in Netherlands
Jump up on some shoulders baby, you never dance
You only live once, come on, here's your chance
You could be reborn, half star, half man
If you rise up and grab my hand
If I live to be 1-0-9 I'm still in my prime
If I don't then I don't, I'll live on in your mind
Oh oh oh, mama we made it, aye

Yeah, I'm captivating, boy, leaving 'em baking
When the microphone is vacant, I'm tired of waiting
Big shoes to fill don't get it confused
I will get gutter on 'em, my beats is crispy
My bars is like butter on 'em, with a udder on 'em
So if you pimp, we even and bust a scudder on 'em
Mighty L, the biggest, I mean rap religious
Hit every country of the world, made 'em all dig us
I got a vendetta, I must blend cheddar
I use a pen with the steel, never been better
There never will be one to out skill me
It's nothing you can tell me, it's like God built me

Me and L, same track, it gotta be craz'
It's like, he's Shaq and I'm Dwayne Wade {both: now let's go!}
(Freeway)
Philly Freeway is hard as hell
Battle anybody, pull a trigger, catch a body
Yup, lose your breath, don't mess with the shottie
Put the burner to your mami, then I rock her bells
It's young Freeway on the go
I'm on the speedboat, jeez, don't sit in the cell
Only for a second, then they get they bell
When I put the freeze on, you gon' need your coats
It's a cold one, you gonna need your toast
But me and L O.G.'s overseas for winning
Your body moms, Swiss cheeses with us, and they no
Teasing with us, she break us off, she trynna please us both
Chicks argue then I leave 'em broke
I'm just a 'boy in the hood' like Jody Breeze
The bundle book still owe cheese
And the haters on the block wanna see me broke
Yeah I know they wanna see me smoke
But I'm the person who the smoke and can't open your V
Then I go, crack open the O.E.
The don heron flow keeping it potent, let's go"
181,Why Do You Think They Call It Dope?,1989,Walking With A Panther (1989),,LL Cool J,"Warning, MC's stand back
You better take a chill and observe the skill
Of the man who can, so understand god damn
I got a masterpiece a master plan and a brand new
Way to attack the wack cut 'em down to size
To realize LL's back
Don't sleep I'm too sweet to repeat a beat
A lyric or rhyme I wouldn't waste your time
With weak words, that's for nerds, you never heard a rhyme
So you deserve a line rougher than rough enough is enough
I'm, gonna slaughter choke ya smoke ya like a sauna
You don't really wanna
But if you wanna battle on here's a lesson: stop 'fessin
I'm a lethal weapon, you better get to steppin
Off the stage, and outta my face
You're too light ?? save the bass
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
It seems like people-'ll never understand
On the microphone I'm not your average man
I cool out sometimes, I save my best rhymes
And then the toy boy thinks that he can come and get mine
Let your friends gas him up, talk trash and make bets
Then gets played like those kids who tried to rob Goetz
You don't know what I'm sayin'? Yo check it
Give me any microphone and god damnit I'll wreck it!
I'm coldblooded I'm about to mutilate
Last year before I left I told you to wait
But you couldn't stay loyal started goin' astray
Thinkin' Tom, Dick, and Harry can mess with Cool J
Is you crazy? I'm boomin, got the talent of two men
The stamina and skill in battle to kill a few men
The heart of a lion, the loyalty of a soldier
I wreck your whole mob then tell ya I told ya!
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
'Cause I don't jab around you, I come inside
Bob and weave, deceive until you get tongue tied
Brawl for all give a lyrical display
And next time you know better than to get in my way
""Yo whassup wit LL?
Will he ever make another 'Rock the Bells'?""
Yo brothers is comin' up, ""I think he's fallin' off
I don't think he's still 'hard as hell'""
See, this is the attitude, of ignorant ones
'Cause they don't know, all them MC'sll get done
One or two might say, ""Yo L'll be back""
But the rest they be suckin on SUGAR SMACKS
Talkin' that crap about who's better than me
You think so? Just let a MC
Make me mad enough, to really wanna battle
I put a L on his ass like he was cattle!
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Just 'cause I make a love song, or say a simple rhyme
""Boom, move over L, it's Miller Time""
I don't know whether to laugh, get ill or get wild
Cause brothers don't realize, I got so many styles
Like triplin up the words, confusin all the nerds
Heard put my sights on mics and ?? flippin above the word
To the mother, no other
MC brother, can mess with Ladies Lover
I'm original, I'm bright under color
And when I get on the mic, yo I burn rubber
Can't stand criticism, give 'em an exorcism
Been rockin' for years, now I have wisdom
The way I'm kickin the lines you can hear my tongue twist
And it'll have your neck spinnin like you're spineless
I'm pickin' 'em up, throwin' 'em down
Hypin 'em up and slowin 'em down
All of these words with only one tongue
Shakin 'em up and then bakin 'em up
Smash boom bash scrapin 'em up
Now you thought that was hard, I just begun
'Cause I'm a roll on the microphone
And take control just like Al Capone
I'm notorious, you're foolish if you sleep on me
'Cause I'm too slick to let a rapper get sweet on me
Try to make a move for my heavyweight belt
You get played like the Wizard of Oz witch, you melt
Yo I'm crazy dope, with super hype lines
And a lot of hype lines make one dope rhyme
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Cause that's what it is
Why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you why do you think they call it dope?
Why do you think they call it dope?

182,You Can't Dance,1985,Radio (1985),,LL Cool J,"Hey man, I've seen ya. Think ya rockin' it on the floor?
You look like a moron! Who let you in the door?
To put the question bluntly: maybe your feet's deformed.
They should slap you in the teeth when you put your dancing shoes on.
You can't dance.
Why don't you just snap your feet to the floor?
Homeboy, what's the use?
Anytime you wanna step inside a party,
First think of an excuse.
You dance like a fat old lady
Not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice,
But every time you try to get one move right
The old lady then did it twice.
You can't dance.
You've been a dancing disco disaster,
The worst I ever saw.
They should dropkick you in the neck
And drag you off the floor.
In every discotech, I see you there
In the middle of the crowd,
Looking like you got eight or nine left feet dragging all around.
You can't dance.
Take my advice, don't move!
You'll never get the knack.
If I danced like you I'd sneak out the party
And wouldn't be coming back.
On the floor you're a dinosaur, yeah boy, that's how you move.
You look like Ralph Cramden (?) or a Donald Duck cartoon.
You can't dance.
You wanna come to my party?
I wouldn't give you a chance.
You tried to take breakdance lessons,
Ended up in an ambulance.
Wouldn't it be funny if they put you on solid gold?
You dance like you got arthritis already,
What'll happen when you get old?
You can't dance.
Why are you so stiff?
Is it something that your mother did?
Maybe you grew up around ""can't dance"" people
When you were a ""can't dance"" kid.
You live in a ""can't dance"" house,
Went out with a ""can't dance"" car,
Your doofy ""can't dance"" father
Got drunk in a ""can't dance"" bar.
You take a ""can't dance"" bath,
Put on your ""can't dance"" cologne.
Go out to a ""can't dance"" party
So you wouldn't have to ""can't dance"" all alone.
You can't dance.
Homeboy, will you please get off the floor, you moron?"
183,You and Me,2000,G.O.A.T.: Greatest Of All Time (2000),,LL Cool J,"Yeah, uh, uh
Word up
And you say New York City
A-ha-ha, word up {Take me away, baby}
Uh, uh, uh... uh
Damn, you and your man had beef
So he left you Uptown, teary eyed, on the back streets
For me to scoop up in the Bentley drop
Long as God hold me down you know I had to stop
What the deal ma? You wanna use my cell?
You runnin' solo? This block foul as hell
You said my ex be beatin' on me
He mad jealous even though he be cheatin' on me{he be cheatin' on me}
Mmm, I said miss, let me tell you somethin'
Bout who's makin' major moves and who's frontin
Huh, who's talkin' loud but ain't sayin' nuttin
And those who get the one they want but keep frontin
He don't appreciate the well till it run dry
Love is blind, it's hard to say goodbye {goodbye, baby}
But smart birds choose to fly
'Cause we livin' in the hood girlfriend, it's do or die
Here's my definition, of love everlasting
I would trade all my cash in, for passion
Tiffany jewels and designer fashions
To hear happiness is mine for the askin{Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh}
Every day on my knees I pray
That I would run into someone that make me feel this way
What you think, you wanna ride with L?
Some things are meant to be baby, you never can tell
{I wanna ride, with you baby}
Chorus: Kelly Price
Every night, every day
I just sit and dream about you
You and me... you and me...
Hold me tight, ecstasy
Makin' love till everlasting
Baby you and me, yeah... you and me...
(LL Cool J)
Now we dippin on the FDR
It's one of them lucky nights when you can peep out the stars
We speak without talkin' and the world is ours
When I glance over at ya I can feel your power
You schemin, L want a one-night stand
I'm schemin, she probably in love with her man
But we keep on rollin', hopin there's somethin' more
Dreamin' about tomorrow and what life got in store
Livin', no drama, we can chill, relax
Sex all night in the morn' count stacks
Sip Grand Marnier and maybe puff a dime sack
But only in moderation, we ain't livin' like that, y'know?
We jetted up the tavern on the green
To talk about love cause the game's extreme
Domestic abuse and everything in between
'Cause I want you to think of me when you need a shoulder to lean on
I'm from Queens, I'ma rep to the fullest
But I'd rather chill with you, 'stead of dodgin bullets
Glock in the stash I don't really wanna pull it
On some so-called thug cat, that's faker than acryllics
He said your fam be ridin' your nerves
And you hate him for never givin' you the life you deserve
Remember, the one who hold a grudge is foul
And everything you ever wanted is in front of you now
Whassup?
(LL Cool J)
I promise you, dreams do come true
There's trials and tribulations that we all go through
When your heart's bleedin, how could the sky seem blue?
But listen up shorty, this is what I wanna do
Be there for you, baby care for you
When my dogs stare at you never sharin you
And to my ex-girlfriend, never comparin you
And do the things that your ex never dared to do
Time to bounce baby, I'm takin' you home
Look at the moonlight sparkle on the 20 inch chrome
The rocks on my hand got a life of they own
Plus the blend tape's bumpin and it's settin the tone
Should I jet to the hotel, is now the right time
Or should I be patient and explore your mind?
You said you grew up in the ghetto and it hurt your heart
Tried to live smart but your dreams fell apart
You dated hustlers and brought 'em customers
They totally destroyed whatever trust there was
Now you hate men and everything they stand for
Cause you wanna be treated like a queen, not a whore
Close your eyes, don't be afraid to dream
Open your heart to this cat from Queens
Whatever you wanna do, however you wanna do it
Back to back baby, we can get each other through it
(LL talks over the 3X)
Knahmean? Word up
Yeah, yeah
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
Yeah...
I just want you to think about that, y'knahmsayin?
Late at night when you layin there
And you feel like the whole world is fallin' around you
Remember these words that I said
There's somebody out there for you baby
Might be me, you never know, ahahah
Word up, stay strong shorty
Keep your eyes up to the sky, knahmsayin?
Don't let nobody tell you you can't make it
And don't let nobody around you tell you
That it ain't possible to make your dreams come true
Word up, uh
Knahmean? That's real
Queens represent, rock on

184,You'll Rock,1985,Radio (1985),,LL Cool J,"(LL Cool J)
The momentum of this party can only increase
The design of this rhyme is a masterpiece
You'll wanna kick steps to the musical feast
And witness the force I'm about to release
You'll rock!
(LL Cool J)
I'm a professional producer of hip-hop songs
In case you're unaware my beats are always strong
I'll exterminate your crew if I don't like you
With one rhyme I subdue my adversaries are through
I'm the best, fascinatin' my names' Cool J
I'm the royalty of rap, what else can I say
Experienced, rhyme skilled, plus my voice isn't waxed
Funky fresh party rocker, so let's face facts
I'll dust a rapper off if I require practice
Vocal cords so rough that I can eat cactus
Choreographer of rhymes, best of all times
Composition technican with the b-boy's mind
Terrorizin' emcee's instructions in my path
Make your girlfriend ask me for my autograph
I'm the mic dominater, best of all times
And you ain't heard nothin' till you heard J rhyme
You'll rock!
(LL Cool J)
Now I'ma tell you the mean behind the scratchin' sounds
He's Cut-Creator - Philly-Philly as the DJ crown
Me and him are imitatin' but never underatin'
My rhymes and his cuts have been consolidated
The mission ain't complete without the use of his hands
He makes my rhymes so fresher, my beat expands
So I'll like you to meet him, but don't attempt to beat him
A Five Man Crew, me and him will defeat them
He'll scratch and wipe out all foes
Turntable terrorizin' and I think you should know
That were - high calibered and my names' J
And for all you sucker crews it's Judgment Day
To ring this encounter, I'm your rhyme sayer
I have to say it girls, but yes, I'm a player
Materials royal, I'm a'nating all
Like brown with dimples and I'm six-feet tall
And promoter of recordings that I call my own
And I'll love to take one of you ladies home
I'll complete and clear, infiltratin' your ears
My litera-ture is above Shakespeare
Emcee - a sucker natter and I just won't stop
I'm the author and the designer of the jam you'll rock
I'm a lyrical game on the heels of fame
And the world is glad that Cool J came
You'll rock!
(LL Cool J)
Now I'm a dedicate this rhyme to my favorite street
You think about it every time that you hear this beat
Any other jam you hear just dis-regard
This is the National Anthem of the Boulevard
See I'm loyal to the bully cause it tought me the deal
Certainly the place to be and that's how I feel
Farmers Boulevard, E-Love and me Cool J
In the center of it all is a cute 3-A
Forty-seven will surrender till emcee's in fear
Queens Boulevard is soft, they don't come around here
Quick as L's on my face I will hold my space
And to taste, stimulate, and conduct the bait
You'll rock!
(LL Cool J)
Now I'ma kick it for the beat, check complete my mission
Subtractin' emcee's like a mathematician
Jammin' up the board at the rappin' commission
Soul inventor of this composition
I disintegrate rappers I can and I could
The great Edgar Allan Poe couldn't write this good
But I'm the Warlord of rap with my own army
Japans' whole military couldn't disarm me
Super bad, cold-crushed, number one b-boy
Like a paintin' from Picasso, I'm the real McCoy
Crown-Prince of rappin', Godfather of bees
Emcee's that need a new lady to feed
You'll rock!
(LL Cool J)
YouknowI'msayin'? Break!
YouknowI'msayin'? Break! Break! Break two!"
185,You're in My Heart,1989,Walking With A Panther (1989),,LL Cool J,"(LL Cool J)
Do you remember, the first time you fell in love
The way it felt, the way it feels
Bein able to say, from the bottom of your heart
[Smooch] I love you for real
Your eyes, meet; you feel your heartbeat
Palms are sweaty you can't keep still
And when you finally touch 'em, and hug 'em and kiss 'em
... Ooh what a thrill!
You was always searchin, and finally your dream came true
They came strollin along
And you promised 'em, straight up and down sweetheart
I swear - I'll never do you wrong
Hand in hand, heart to heart
Nothin' in the world could separate the two
And even though you've only known that person for a short time
You tell 'em I love you -- you're my heart
You argue witcha parents, and they argue BACK
You're too young to be so serious
You tell 'em that's not true, I'll go on without you
And walk away aggravated and furious
You want 'em to approve, but then again it don't matter
The relationship's yours
You feel you're maturin, and hey...
You can fight your own battles and wars
You discuss it with your love and it's the same for them
So the two of you decide we're gonna weather the storm
Life is sweet, kissin' caressin and huggin
And keepin' each other warm
But now comes the serious part, cause love
Believe me, it ain't a easy task
We'd have one argument too many
And you'd have to ask -- am I still your heart?
Am I still your HEART or is somethin', pullin us apart
Cause baby if it is, please let me know what
You run out the door, I tell you come back
I love you - you shout out, so what?
How could you hurt me? How could you treat me
Like you never loved me, were you playing a game?
And if so, I only have one request: sit down and explain
To me, the person who treated you right, did you right
And held you tight, every night
Is there another lover in your life, that has you uptight?
'Cause if it is, aww, baby, please... don't do this to me
I'm tryin' to reach you, tryin' to talk to you
It's killin' me -- 'cause you're my heart
That's right I admit it
You're my heart I refuse, to let you go
I struggle and fight for you against all odds
Get down on my knees, and pray to God
That our love is in the cards
'Cause I know you're right for me
And I know I'm right for you
There's no way in the world I'll let you slip out of my hands
People say forget about it, move on
... But see they don't understand
You're nothin' to them, but you're so much to me
So much in fact that I'd give my life
To stare into your eyes and caress your face
As the priest, announces us man and wife
We'd live happily, ever after
White picket fence and the whole nine yards
And anything that anybody said
I'd disregard -- if I was still your heart
So make up your mind, 'cause I've made up my mind
I'm beggin you baby please come back home
I'll be tossin and turnin', as I lay in my bed
Sorrow surrounds me I can feel it in my bones
This can't be true, I'm losin you
Oh Lord have mercy, please make it all right
All I wanna do in this whole wide world... is hold you tight
I've ripped open my heart, shed tears and cried
Now it's up to you baby, please understand
I forgive you for everything, and give you anything
Just let me take ya by the hand
And lead ya, baby I got ya
Protect you like a mother, protects a child
Now it's up to you... I'ma call you in a little while
You're my heart"
