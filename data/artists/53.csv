And in the morning the sun don't seem to shine
I will stay here forever
Standing right by your side
You know they say (they say) that it's all gonna end some day
So, right before it does (right before it does)
Let's make love (let's make love)
Like tomorrow was 2012
The last day on Earth, 2012
The end of the world, 2012
You'll be my man and I'll be your girl
2012 x 7
Now they be telling me that these are the last days
Are we really that close to Armageddon
If living on the planet till this point has been hell
I survived 'cause I am legend
What if it's all about to be over
Then I'm gonna say you need to be my girlfriend
Hit the blunt after the world in the dim
Then you can get it in like the world fixin to end
It's predicted by the ancient Mayan civilization
I don't want to see the world go soon
But with such a beautiful girl in the room
I want to be up in you when the world go boom
Get down with your body till it's lights out
Making love till the terminator come
Global warming is having a major effect
Comfort each other but we don't know which way to run
Mother Earth is about to go to another cycle
And I know that is about to end someday (someday)
Right before it does (right before it does)
Let's make love (let's make love)
Like tomorrow was 2012
The end of the world, 2012
The last day on Earth, 2012
You'll be my man and I'll be your girl
2012 x 7
Tomorrow it's all about to be over
So I only live to serve ya
The dark is about to devour the Earth
So come and ride with the Silver Surfer
Now will it all in from the element
Of ether or artificial intelligence
As long as we both have the passion
The sex it just makes all the issues irrelevant
I know it's all about to go
So I just sit back and blow my dro
(Right before it does)
Steady looking at the clock,
Before we suffer let me make your body rock
Having sex till the big bomb drops
Or till the planet go pop
2012, The last day on Earth
2012, The end of the world
2012, You'll be my man and I'll be your girl

All I know is Twista rap I spit nigga, fuck y'all, check it out
Twis' got skill Yes I kill
I could ride on they ass like Buffalo Bill
I be winnin' in the game like them niggas in the south
If a nigga talkin' shit I'm quick to hit 'em in the mouth
Them lyrics that's the shit I be equipped to spit 'em out
And Imma make a nigga sick 'cause I got venom in the mouth
Antonyms and synonyms are spinnin him out of his route
And I got bricks of money bitch and I can't fit 'em in the couch
Kill 'em with the ride paints hard with the deep dish
Kill 'em wit syllables quick wit 8 bars in a sequence
I am the bidness I gotta charge you to peep this
Niggaz can't see me I'm ray Charles or a eclipse
Stevie in the blackout see me with the Mack out
Twista gon get money like a GD in a crack house
When it come to flows Imma spit 'em like they cold
When it come to niggaz heads Imma split it like a pole
Take away they swag and shit on they cocky style
'Cause my lyrics be too quick they call me Twista Pacquiao
Come solo wit my k-olo when you see my logo come take my photo when I'm on promo
Niggas wanna get me they better pick a new regimen
Shit too sick B somebody better go get you medicine
Not bringin' up Twista I'm makin' the issue relevant
Balls bigger than mine betta go get 2 elephants
I be getting grimy but you and yo click too elegant
Beat yo face up till yo jaw tissue look like a pelican
I be steady whoopin yo ass just fo the hell of it
Can't nobody fuck wit me the planet is celibate
I kick a hot flow, get it like Harpo
Brief when I rhyme teeth shine like a car show
Wit a thick bitch, go head check out my cargo
You know one gon be wit me wherever my car go
Where yo baby at where yo white Mercedes
At ill let you borrow the Bentley as long as you bring it back
Here, a couple stacks, you ain't gotta pay me back
Me and yo boss kick it and he know where the ladies at
Whether we comin' and killin' and murderin 'cause I beat down the block
Or because I'm like ?throw ya hands up' 'cause it's hip hop
I'd rather be rappin' about the streets and makin' a quick pot
But it's time to do something so the shorties don't get popped
Meanwhile back to the lab I got the desert eagle
Come on yo muthafuckin tip and kill a lot of people
Throw up on a priest let him know I ain't no reverend
Either dat I go where the fuck I want I'm up in heaven evil
U ain't gotta tell me I know I spit bars sick
E-mail, anthrax, flows kick arsenic
G-up genie and throw it up I'm car sick
Cut raw dope deez nigga cut garbage
Lethargic give a bitch hard dick see my niggaz and I say salute like a sergeant
Can't lie I'm one of the coldest artists so I wouldn't have yo bitch up in my apartment
So I be passin out fuck you flyers da fakers and heaters and then fuck liars
If yo' shit ain't one been one minded the swine flu h1n1 virus
Am I like Jason no I'm more like Michael Myers
I am the shit I need to wear diapers
When I spit it sometimes I'm all to philosophical
Blame it on the Don Julio and killer tropical
Twista got more swag than a rich sissy
But don't get prissy muthafuckas can get grilly
Imma balla and a boss and yes I'm finna get paid
Takin' flames to the head like I'm Nicolas Cage
I ghost ride the whip I'm finna get laid
Any niggaz dat try to get me is finna get sprayed
One day it's possible dat I'm finna get saved
But for now I be getting money I'm finna get paid muthafucka
Fucka... fucka... fucka... fucka"
2,411,2002,Legit Ballaz: Respect the Game Vol. 3 (2002),Midwest Rap,Twista,"Why you all in my business
Why you really really want to know the 4-1-1
Is it cause that my game's tight
I can scoop a bitch and fuck her on the same night
(Verse 1: High Beam)
It was a, Saturday evening bout seven at night
White T, white thongs pockets feeling all right
I got a, call from one of my carmel chicks
She said I mean be careful I think they talking on some hate shit
Despite the talk of the town, I'ma be there
For 45 minutes when you hear the horn come down
And when she climbed in, I received a kiss and a hug
In a minute take off your shoes on a white persian rug
Wave your number rolling going to get bent
Why they sure call thugs mugging I see him right through the tent
He had the nerve enough to tap on my glass
But he ain't had enough light to peek in but I almost blast his ass
Is it cause that I'm known to bust
So quick to bump a bad bitch that y'all known to trust
So when you see me on them thangs in the cadillac truck
Man don't even know me when you see your bitch in the back or front
(Verse 2: Todd Nitty)
Foul, god damn you hagging
Sixteen block my wall you want to block my magic
Now you wondering no what Nitty be doing
While these bitches trying to find out who am I screwing
And I'm so, sick and tired of the motherfucking gossip
And I'm, sick and tired of the motherfucking coppers
They actually post up at the end of my block
Take a hoe from her spot just for trying to plot
(*Cop voice*)
(Todd Nitty)
And I'm like, damn friendly why you all on me
Man I'm out here slanging records shit I stopped selling weed
Tell me, are you mad cause you see what I drive
Or are you checking out these broads with the big ass thighs
It be my main bitch, getting on my last nerves
Closest now to the edge from getting kicked to the curb
She got a homegirl, all up in her hair
Maybe they just meant my hair's longer than her's
(Twista)
And I'm, sick of them haters that be all in my shit
Everytime I turn around somebody always be talking bout Twist
Want to know who got a baby by me, what does he drive, where my tip
Be all in my bidness because they heard that I've been bumping they chick
I ain't no lie, if I scoop your bitch up
I will, If I get scratch from her
Fold it up, if I tell her bend over
She won't get up, if I give up the bunch
What you need to know fo', you the player po-po
Steady beeking and poking paranoia smoking on too much doe-doe
Creeping all in my bid' no since I first splurged on a Rego
I got birds when I see you, I'm starting to think you work for them people
Hurt 'em when I tell 'em, I think you better ease up, cause everybody
Know you no G when it come to the money put some g's up
Until you hip lock and freeze up, you might as well
Turn around and go like the other way when I see you
(High Beam)
See me riding real slick thick and rolling on thangs
Got the misses and the bitches wanna know my name
They want to know what I'm on
Get the fuck up out of mine homie go on and get your own
Riding slick with the cherry wood grain
In my big boy truck with the candy paint
Why, bitches giving me brain
I know you want to ball like me but you can't
Stay the fuck up out my business man"

6 rings I'm a champion
No worries, I been killing it since she was a shorty
Still standing on top of my glory, and this still ain't the end of my story
Confetti pouring, they be all in the clothes that I'm sporting
6 rings like Michael Jordan, same team no Robert Horry
Put me on the verbal court with my competitors
I'ma be fucking up all of them
Money like Steph Curry, and I dish it out to my team like Chris Paul and them (Griffin!)
So lose and you blame it on fouls and how they don't be calling them
I put in work, I got rings
You can't tell me nothing, I know I earned all of them
That winning feeling I want 'cause if I get the shot I bet I hit the shot
I'm in my glory while pouring champagne on my body like I was Chris Bosh
They won't admit it, how many times I came back and did it
They have no choice to be killing 'em when I spit it
Give me a standing ovation when I visit
Final four delivery, hall of fame flow
Right up in Nirvana is where my motherfucking hangs though
But I ain't finished yet, I'm the exquisite vet
They be like damn Twista they ain't knocked you off your pivot yet
Nope!
It's just me against the world and I won't lose

Who the fuck is you talking to? Nigga I got six rings
Swagging, my walk like I'm Jordan
I know when I'm hot, fingers look like Kareem
When I pull that whip up in front of the club I be knowing they seeing it
And whoever dissing this, 'cause they are fisherman watching the finals and we in it
The league of the streets
Winning the game with a three on the beat
Keeping that thang in the piano seat
One shot at your brain and they flee on their feet
Don't like you when you be like Michael
They run up thinking I be slipping
Long nose, 357 by my side, call me Scottie Pippen
And I'm on bullshit, call [?] about it, Willy said he southpaw
And I murder for the squad like an outlaw
Everything that I say coming out raw
Plenty niggas I know pulling up with a Glock and a key
Acting like they winning the game
Like they pulling up at the top of the key
But I got them accolades, and I spit that fast shit
You just an absurd sound, third round draft pick
And when I win the game, then right there is your history
Celebrate like we do in Chiraq, we gon' tear up the city
It's just me against the world and I won't lose
No I can't lose, I'm a born winner
These streets made a beast out of me
Six rings on my fingers
I'm a champion
Put your fives and your ones up
6 rings, I'm a champion
Getting money, put your ones up
6 rings I'm a champion

I'm bringing pain like two bad nurses, and the pain from these here
Motherfuckin verses ridiculous thirstses involving hearses
To the dirt shit first picks and use'n autos to work with
Slugs to the shirt shit (just to squirt shit)
A wicked hit with an expert kick
And burst till the earth split leave you hurt bitch
Show you how worser than worst get in the zone
See the vein when the pain repel
And then they closin the curtains bitch
(When adrenaline's pumpin')
I don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit
I'm a misunderstood nigga and I'm off my square high
Got me reversin clips and dispersin shit
(Twista)
What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
To make me wanna jump off of the edge
I'm charged off of suckers gettin' shot up off the ledge
No pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head
(So tell me what it said)
Retaliate with lethal repercussion
I feel the reefer rushin
To go into thangs, like it's a wicked stick
Took the Benadryl, hot like I'm fin' ta steal
To get the kickin shit
For niggaz and bitches that I kick it with
I was born to get you pumped up
It's like some lead bust 'cause I give motherfuckers a head rush
Then yo' head bust when you jumped up
'Cause what I said must've got you geeked, my eyes red puffed
From smokin' shit that niggaz hit on to die
Make me wanna slip the clip on the side
And if you act a bitch on the side, if we have to
Then the whole Westside'll let the shit go on and ride
When the trigga bust
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
That's your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uh
That's your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

Pullin up and bailin out like we're carsick, I'm ready to start shit
Start up buryin some heads like an ostrich
And unload the whole cartridge and throw the shells out the garbage

Located his existence with my sixth sense like a compass

And since its nipple my umbilical these flows is critical
This music is miracle like I'm biblical
Killin' like I'm nuttier than buddy love
And still wouldn't leave a bloody glove and start the truck up
And speed the fuck up getaway smokin' this blunt
Dump the adrenaline eruptin my viens I'm pumped up

I'm just a American gangster, US hustler
Home of the brave and in God we trust
I'm just a
Chi-Town bred
Because I got to rep the city to the death
Annihilate them till I don't see nothing left
Remember I spit it for the bitches
Now I'm spitting for the thugs
Hat cocked to the right
Hat cocked to the left
Brother it's a formal
It's a focus on your chest
I spit it for the lords
And the for the folks
And for the Crips and for the Bloods
I'm like an American dream
I role to the green
With the souls and the breeds
And the cobras a kings and the 2-16
Millimeter bullets for the niggas that
Trying to do opposite
They don't really want to see how psycho I can get
I don't really see a motherfucker stopping this
Trying to come at you and the apocalypse
.40 cal will have you screaming, ""I don't want to die!""
I am becoming nauseous with the fake thugs
So it's love
To the real G's and under bosses
To the niggas in the caller case
That got into it big
To get what nobody gave us
We was born into this system
So don't be mad at what you made us
Pull the pistol and cock it and bust in the sky
One time for the US
For turning my niggas to gangsters
Because getting money is what they do best
Hard to fight like I ever did like Al Capone
Gangsters is bosses
K-Town is the motherfucking hood
The Rock is the company, come and step into my office
Forever see me in a 'Lac
Got work but you never see me in a pack
A motherfucker say he never seen me with a strap
And I heard a motherfucker say he don't see me in the hood
Little nigga I don't see you
Because homie my hood is worldwide
And getting money is what we do
Make your knee joints lock when I freak you
Hit the 3 point shot like Hedo
Turkoglu up in the game
You killing the game like Pac
Nigga we point Glocks like he do, see you
No one will recognize I'm the maker of the Midwest
I'm like for real?
Controversy in the middle
I guess I'm like Shaquille
You can go on feel like you feel
Nigga know the hands I like to kill
But if you can hit me with the bangs
Little cheap for shit, let's strike the deal
Got my psychos in the city rolling with me
Always ready bust a cap at the king like do
I can bury your bodies like an animal
Because I'm a cannibal, I eat a nigga like food
Ripping through your flesh so I can devour your heart
Music is my playground
But if the rapping don't get you
I hit this head with the back of the pistol until this bitch nigga lay down
And no competition I had to be fucking a twig?
Whoever coming for me gangster
I'ma get it every time I want to get it
I'm living proof
It's a 'Category F5'"

There was this angel, whoa oh oh oh
There was this angel, and it won't let me go
(Darkside Ballaz: Lo)
I cry in my ? pass me the tissue
They say I got issues
And I reply, I put my life on the line for mines
And that's my only damn mission
When D. Ski died, piece of mind was hard to find
D. Ski we miss you, sweeped nine roadies
From heaven rained down on me
As I write these scriptures, and I'll be fine
I had a whole lot of hell in me
Before we took them pictures, and even worse
Brothers and sisters started hating on me
After we took them bitches, 'cause then you get to take 'em first
Brothers and sisters started waiting on me
To represent for a hood, they never produce us nothing good
Ballas and killas out here waiting on me
To retrieve my goods and leave me stinking in a back wood
Heavenly father have mercy on me, in these struggling times
To tell the truth, it's so hard to be righteous and let my little light shine
(Darkside Ballaz: Sko)
This shit got me pissed off, we use to be like rollies
But now it's 2000, the motherfuckers don't even know me
If I'm right, pass me 'cause they lifted up a hand now
Blinded to 'em every time I get the trash now
Either could get put up on it, and coming up strong
We knew right from wrong, but still we stayed away from home
Over there on Konkress, kicking at the park with
A blessed up niggas that's down with me to your dark with
We'll meet again, I put this on a fiend
If it's possible they end up 'cause we gone drink again
Puffing on this dro ain't the same no mo'
Drinking on this henne shit just ain't the same no mo'
Oh, my nigga lost his life, at an early age
And I cry to this day, wishing that he could have stayed
Played the cards that he was dealt, records gone when it's dark
But my nigga roll in death, as the gauge exploded on the block
And just like Pac, I'ma paint a point of picture, kick it with you
Grab some tissue, wipe my eyes 'cause I miss you
God bless my niggas, I know you still here with us niggas
'Cause I could feel you, I could see you every time I look in the mirror
And not a word can hear you, 'cause I'm making these words clearer
You are my angel, and my nigga, from the drive-by to the trigga

Ayo... ever since a young buck, I been on the come up
Known to dish the raw, dish the law if they come up
And cheddar till the sun up...
If there's a ransom and the law get involved, then we never get it summed up
Never put ya gun up, if ya come round me
I go to war wit' niggaz 'round the corner from 'round me
You could front 'round me, but I read through that
Wit' the mili' and I ain't talkin' 'bout no Segal mac
Niggaz see shoot back, we can see to that
Hit yo front letters see through back, bring yo peoples back
And I used to grind out on my friend's spot
Till he's mom wanted my Tim-bots
Now my paint got me discounts
Or trans-quo all around the world, like I was signed to Pimp-dot
And if it's ten targets and I got ten shots
I'm tryin' to leave at least nine out of them ten shot...

This is how I live it, how it's pictured for real... nigga

Diamonds against wood, underground king for real

Deliver pies like cake, they go straight through yo payment... yup!
Chump... you don't really wanna war

S-P game so damn tough, the 4 4 in the 5th tucked y'all can't hang
Transporter turned rapper, get a camcorder film my life
Still acclompished, tryin' to fill they cups
The rap version of Mandela, call my bluff
We still the street dwellers, feel my pain (my pain)
I spit a verse and split a clip in the rain
A fool-proof when the full force open you up (what!)
(Twista)
Twista will rock you, you don't want the thug apostle to pop you
Hostile when I drop you, turnin' everything colossal to fossiles
I speak street gospel, all they life I spit words and paint portraits
For real niggaz that hold down they fortress and serve off of porches
Hit 'em in the body wit' the powerful forces, that'll end all your doubt
Make you clean up your house, bag up an ounce, hit the dance floor and bounce
We blessed wit' the talent, fuck wit this clique, it ain't gon' be easy
'Cause you fuckin' wit' Twist if you fuck wit Chris, Bleek and Free-wheezy
So speak and breath easy... Or the scutches my future in 3D
I like wars, I'm from a city full of Vice Lords, and GD's
Breeds and Souls, 2-6's, Kings, BD's and Stones
Spanish cobras and all the true soldiers, survive and I'm gone!
Watch me spit if for the killers and hustler's, flippin' all the pounds and bricks
Hate on me I'ma bust at you hoes, and I put eleven down wit' a clip

12,Back 2 School,1992,Runnin' off at da Mouth (1992),Midwest Rap,Twista,"(Tung Twista)
Back to school lets go back to school
Lets go lets go back to school to the oldschool
Lets go back to school to the old school
To the times when the single file lines was the rule
To the days that we had to study all the maps
The days we were kiddin not to take the kid naps
The days when we used to have to wear the dunce caps
And the days when we used to bust the oldschool raps
Sittin' with your buddy studyin for ya test
Lookin' back so that you see up under betty's dress
Couldn't wait for bells to ring so we can go to recess
To kick the battle rhymes just to see who was the best
There were seven emcee's in the 7th grade
I would kick seven rhymes had only seven made
But those seven rhymes we stole
Note the way your toning
I gave the class a blast the way I smash my opponents
Battlin was serious they've all ducked the fist
Because I kick the funky fresh rhymes like fish
Try to swing but they miss they miss like this
Rasheeda's on the monkey bars blowin' me a kiss
Throwin' rhymes back and forth on the see saw
Just to mess with him because I know that he saw
Winkin at Latrice because I know that she saw
Several suckas tried to push us down but we saw
These are the days when the tongue used to rule
Recess is over lets go back to school
Goin' back to school like Rodney Dangerfield
To the lunchroom where the cooks arrange a meal
Ate the sloppy joe where my friends copy so
We can try to get more than emcees can flow
The fun fun fun funky able fable
I stake the style standin on the stable lunch table
Finish up the rhyme so I can pass it to the next
Throw 'em back and forth till we heard the bells flex
Left the lunchroom went to the gymnasium
Ut time to flow we call it a rap stadium
Throwin' rhymes back and forth like a symphany
I wanna start a battle so step to him for me
The whylin got sensible because we saw the principal
Like grammar school somehow the principal's invicible
Shot a couple hoops the rims are called fruit loops
And if you miss we say opps and leave the gym like troops
Single file line but we were still at the pool
The day is over tomorrow back to school
After school I'm home with my mom she's pleased
'Cause rappin' help me learn there were never F's and D's
'Cause when I'm spellin bees it would help me stand these
Didn't worry about freaks on the street sellin keys
Rock the streets beats from the mouth no tracks
Rhymes be simple bust on how they ain't wack
I walk into a battle say what we havin' here
Back in them days I was called a cavalier
Me and baby used to flow the flows like food
Me and James Phillips used to rock the high schools
Me and Carl Tolta used to rock the neighborhood
Don and Aviator used to show that they were good
Me and Johnny Love used to rock the rock parties
And my brother Johnny kicks a dance to fade everybody
Me and kingdom rock used to rock the south blocks
An empire of destruction had emcees on their jocks
The past I have stated, they way we used to rule
Even though we graduated lets go back to school"
13,Back to the Basics,2010,The Perfect Storm (2010),Midwest Rap,Twista,"(Diddy)
Hey yo Twista, it's about that motha fuckin' time again.
Time to let these niggas know,
The originator, never to be duplicated.
King of that machine gun spit shit.
Hey yo Twista, blow a motha fuckas brains out.
(Twista)
I'm about to take everybody back to the basics
I'm historical an oracle event is about to occur
Because a mother fucker put these raps in the matrix
And I'm a terror when I spit it on tracks full of hatred
But it's beauty in the dark
Just put it into your mouth and the flow is mmm
Like that when you taste it
Come at niggas like a disciple of death
You would think I'm poppin' a rifle or tech
I'm aimin right for the neck
Your momma might as well call up the funeral home
So she can write 'em a check
A vile of dialect
That's why they feelin' me a trilogy
A horror is what I become
So they call me Jason Vorhee
Oops I mean chasin more cheese
Niggas gotta pay some more fees
Hot enough to break a thermometer from another planet
I kill 'em from here to Andromeda
A comet will hit the planet when I'm in the middle
While rappers swallow you a diabolical astonisher
Astronomer because I'm outta the Galaxy
Challenge me I will disintegrate your body like a particle
Follow you into a corridor at four in the morning
So I can horrify you right before I slaughter you
My boys sayin' they don't think I'm comin' with it
So you know a nigga gotta get 'em all
Then I'mma be
Murderin them like a serial killer
Then I'mma hide 'em in the ceiling and the wall
Fuck 'em all!
Niggas will never get next to this
I rock a rollie so I flex the wrist
I'mma blow up and sit in your place
And throw up shit in your face
Like the exorcist
You can't mess with this.
Now let's take shit back to the basics
How we used to do shit
With the original sound
But still somehow comin' with that new shit
Talk about the way it ain't no morals or respect in the streets no more
Don't pause with the heat no more
'Cause there really ain't nothing out here to eat no more
Nowadays niggas acting like they lovin' the dime
Used to be some respect
But now they just kill and stack em
Cause Benjamin Franklin a governor now
Theoretically you better be ahead of everybody
Around you 'cause a nigga might fuck you
Don't need to be nothing but killers in your family that always surround you
Cause a nigga might touch you
Since the recession it been hard on the streets
So a nigga comin' hard on the beats
No order in the hood
I remember when niggas would get into it
They gone have to take problems to chief
Now they don't give a fuck who they be shootin
Or who they be robbin or what you ride
All they really care bout is who got that
And if you let one of these knucklehead bitches
Know you're sitting on something
Mothafuckas is gonna be at that
South side murderer
It's the west side killer
Up north and over east is a beast
What they release
Be leavin' you deceased
Fuck up anybody that try to do damage
The block is the planet
And shawty's is too buck for it to be peace
So I carry a piece
But I don't wanna shoot it
'Cause I already wanna see some of my niggas locked up in jail home
Instead of hollerin at 'em on a cell phone
R.I.P. 'cause my little brother Rell gone
Got to show a different way to get it
Instead of bein on the attack full of hatred
Or get smacked in the face with
The reality of death if we don't get back to the basics
Now let's take shit back to the basics
How we used to do shit
With the original sound
But still somehow comin' with that new shit
Talk about the way it ain't no morals or respect in the streets no more
Don't pause with the heat no more
'Cause there really ain't nothing out here to eat no more"

(Chorus: Twista)
Been go go-getters, e'ryday money getter
Gotta make a billion, everyday go-getter
Donald Trump makin' big money go-getter
Fast lane ridin', young stack of go-getters
He's a billion dollar boy, she's a billion dollar girl
Billion dollar boy, billion billion dollar girl
Billion dollar boy, billion billion dollar girl
He's a billion dollar boy, she's a billion dollar...
(Twista)
Yeah we get that money, yeah we get that cash
E'ry day, all day, gotta make that cash
Got them haters everywhere tryin' to plot on ya ass
That's why I keep the flash just to push they ass back
Twista gotta get that paper e'ry day
If you wanna play in them big league games
Stack yo' money to the sky all day
When you tryin' to make a billion ain't no time for you to play
(Interlude: Twista)
Money money money, money money money
Favorite color green 'cause they like money
Money money money, money money money
Favorite color green 'cause they like money
Twista gettin' dough, Twista gettin' green
Countin' them stacks, makin' that cream
Twista gettin' bread, Twista gettin' presidents
Billion dollar mindstate, just for the hell of it
(Busta Rhymes)
We gettin' A-rab money
Let's get this A-rab money, ay
I'm bilingual, I be freakin it in Spanish
I speak English but billions is my proper language
Funny you could wrap it like a mummy with a honey
And I'll make the people love me while they hug me with they money
And I'm always in a hurry just to come and cook it curry
Or bake, MORE CAKE, shinin like the day was sunny
And I knew the Lord love me, bless and bestow all upon me
While I embellish all in it, that's the basis of the story
Pardon all of my aggressions, still get it in a recession
And I got the antedote, you could pay me for the confession
And it's money in the air, hope you niggaz fill it up in here
YOU GOT IT? Let me show you how to be a billionaire
(Twista)
Steppin in the spot, GMG is the team
We don't know about y'all but we stack our cream
Haters everywhere, we don't really care
When they be talkin' that shit over here you know we don't play fair
He's a billion dollar boy, she's a billion dollar girl
Money money money is the root of all worlds
Never let it make you, make that money
G's on the Louie 13 gettin' scummy"

19,Blood N Blood Out,1999,Legit Ballin' (1999),Midwest Rap,Twista,"Me and my closest road dog

Blood in Blood out brothers and we swore that was for life
Servin' them keys and be clocking them g's and
We got whatever you need just a come and see me
Or my mutherfucking nug bout to show this city up show love
Or catch that bug from that nine millimeter slug
I broke bread with this nigga, I bust lead with this nigga
Heard he fucking with the feds
Can't believe it, not my nigga
Selling me for the cash, was he moving too fast
Talking behing my back to them damn hood rats
I'm going crazy ain't that a bitch
You try and get bitched and your closest rodey
Turns into a snitch
Just smiling and laughing in your fucking face
Went behind your fucking back hooking you with a fucking case
Going insane and I don't know what to think
Paranoid out my mind as I take another drink
Of that hennessy motherfuckin cognac
Got me reaching for my nine
Bout to peel this niggas cap
So I walked out the house
And I headed for the corner
I seen that nigga creeped up on him
Bitch yous a goner
Up that itchy to his temple why'd you try to fuck me Rodey
Started crying C-M-B
Nigga this ain't to New Jack City
And my name ain't no mutherfuckin Nino Brown
A tear roll down my cheek and I blew his brains on the ground
Sirens all around lights all in my face
Dick boys on the case so I headed towards the gate
Bitch freeze
Bitch please
That's what I told them punk ass cops
All of a sudden I heard the shot
Couldn't believe I just got popped
Didn't drop, turned around, grapped my nine, then I pulled it
Started yelling just like fates a_?Bitch I took your fucking
Bulleta_?
Everything turned cold and got dark
I couldn't feel nathan but the beating of my heart
Blood in blood out
I thought that we was family
Can't believe he crossed me
Got to break him off G
Am I my brothers keeper
I thought that was for life
It's gonna be a murder this nigga gots ta die"

My crews are sittin' on ostrich
Smoking the blunt that's preposterous
Shoe box, a hundred in my closet
On the way to the bank to make a deposit
I get dollars and money 'cause I deserve it
Do what the fuck I want with it 'cause I earned it
Roll up one hundred dollar bill, then I burn it
Put some bud up in the bag then I serve it
Words is, comin' down up out the way that I be such a professional when I purr
What I heard about rookies
They don't know what they be doing when they fuckin' with the huffers that are fuckin' with the girl scout cookies
Get the hash, light it up
If you got some bad bitches, then invite them up
I burn a blunt and if it's tires on a car we burn a rubber, give a motherfucker [?]
I know that weed gon' linger
Cause ain't no telling what we gon' bring you
You wanna feel it, cover the hole, and hit it in the bone
Now release your finger
Get the full effect up out the mechanism
When I hit the ism as if I was looking through a prism
Rollin' with Berner and Wiz and we get high as
I wanna get for my niggas that be looking through a prison
I don't take it for granted, so I blow
I'mma keep it with me wherever that I go
You ain't gonna tell me, I know that my eyes low
I don't give a fuck, I light up and ride slow
Everything I know burn, and my flows burn and my rings burn
And my watch burn and my truck burn
And my eyes burn and my green burn

Yo Twist!
Shit, niggaz out here been talkin' real sideways man
Shit... it's time to show niggaz what's really hood
(Chorus: Twista)
Bussin never discussin
People are runnin' niggaz is gunnin
Killers are runnin' because it was stunnin
Hearin the ambulance when it be comin' in
Roll in the Chevy Malibu I know they dig that
In the secret compartment is where I hid that
Try to avoid wherever I see the pigs at
Forty-fo' and black Calico when I push your shit back
When I'm out of town I go wherever the hood at
Because I know where I can get somethin' that's good at
The dopefiends is gon' show me where the kush at
Ain't got no cigarette loaded where the backwood at
Come walkin' up and get a pistol in your face hoe
If you want an autograph you better say so
Otherwise everybody gon' have to stay low
'Cause I'm about to give this motherfucker a halo~!
Bodies droppin' pistols poppin' we bustin' our tecs
People scatterin around like it was a bomb threat
Got plenty ammunition, show me where your ones at
So much terrorism they askin me where Saddam at
Like Bush I alarm 'em bomb 'em let fire open out
Go forth catch him open choke him and try to smoke him out
Shit is serious I'ma show you what this dough about
That's what you motherfuckers get for havin' an open mouth
I'm killin' new arrivals every time I shoot a rifle
Leave you suicidal cause everything I do is vital
Displayin mo' evil than the preacher that threw the bible
Win a Bentley don't think it's mine till I show you the title
In the car breakin up trees, call me a lumberjack
You say you a baller then nigga where the hundreds at?
Get me in the club, it won't be none of that
A 22 on my body like I'm a Dallas Cowboys running back
(Hook: Twista)
Catch one in yo' leg if you RUN UP
Catch one in yo' body if you RUN UP
Catch one in yo' head if you RUN UP
You can end up dead if you RUN UP
I'ma cop me a Benz when I COME UP
I'ma cop me a Beemer when I COME UP
I'ma shit on the phonies when I COME UP
I'ma hit all the homies when I...
I lay you niggaz out like tomorrow's outfit
You gettin' me pissed, you niggaz ain't about shit
Before you get me started I suggest you bounce bitch
I got AR-15's to come up in yo' house with
To tell yo' woman she look good in them killer jeans
Think it's butter I wanna cut her like a guillotine
Need to get at her but right now it's still a dream
I'd like the thong, but right now for the microphone I'm still a fiend
I'm on the block servin' up rock like Johnny Unitas
With killer niggaz we didn't really care if you like us
Vicious, so cold, that I be catchin laryngitis
Still shit that's hotter than any temperature on fahrenheit is
Gotta read celsius just to say you felt me bust
Better be yo' healthiest thinkin' you can belt me up
All up in my face talkin' 'bout you gon' tell me WHAT
I ain't gon' be the one needin my homies to help me up
Now come in with that let me take a lil' hit of the blig
This pussy nigga right here wanna get rid of my nigz
He don't want it 'cause we got the chrome thing-a-ma-jigs
And I make a nigga quit rappin' and go get him a gig
I'm buck when I'm on a mission you better watch how I do
You got what I want so I'm creepin' 'cause I got a rival
I'm thirsty as FUCK~! and money is the water bottle
Thinkin' you hard to follow but I'm on you like Polamalu
With the shotty I'ma bring drama to you quarter leagues
Make that mighty dollar if I gotta transport a ki
Call me Ali Baba 'cause I'm runnin' with 40 thieves
30-somethin' and I be hotter than all the shorties be
32 shot automatic, yeah I call it magic
Two clips, 34 shots, pall bearers and a casket
A couple of glocks, to kill off any cause of static
Didn't have the calico but you broke cause you thought I had it"

For steady makin' noise bumpin up against the headboard
And they be hatin' somebody gon' come and beat on the door
""Get off of the landlord""

The neighbors said if we keep it up
They gonna have to call the police
And we're gonna be up in the streets (woo ooh woo ooh)
'Cause I act like a fool
And my chick knows she gets so pumped when she bump
Like a thump in a trunk on the couch where she hump but instead
It goes bumpity bump
We're about to get put out this hotel if you keep on screaming
We're about to get put out the crib if you keep on screaming
Girl your love is terrific
And Whenever I hit it

And we makin' everybody in they rooms sick
And all of my neighbors be trippin'
And beatin' on the ceiling with they're broomstick
And if we decide to sip a little liquor

The damage Imma do when I get back is a guarantee
Somebody call 911
All the freaky noise that you make it be makin'
Me want you to get up
Let me put this pillowcase in yo face
Before you wake somebodies kids up
Even though I pay the rent for the crib

Twista, first time I kicked it off with ""Adrenaline Rush""
Next album I kicked it off with ""They Kill Us All""
This time, I'ma show you how to ""Check That Hoe""
Check it out
Take a look at the way that I came
Hard times, long road, mean streets
Motherfuckers back up off me when they look at the way that I am
Put the bullet in your brain when I ride nigga
Got it out when you entered they don't fuck with the boss
If you disrespectin me I'm reposessin
Like you catchin the holy ghost make him die like he touchin the cross
Now you spiritually committed suicide nigga
I got the power to get diamonds and riches and gold
Motherfuckers tried to get it with extortion
But I'm too vicious for blows and I'm checkin' these bitches and hoes
Make a shower full of hollow point bullets rain on
For yo' death you got me lookin' in my itinerary
If I ain't got scheduled to be dead where the men are buried
I think I can fit you another cemetery
Like a disciple of death I'm bringin' pain on
I can see nobody playin' me like I'm a punk
I'ma let you know off top if you come at me bogus
And there's more than one of y'all if I gotta stop I'ma dump
You done made me a murderer from the Westside
Haters come at smilin' but really they wanna fuck up a nigga hustle
So I just get bubble smokin' bubble when I try to just stay out of trouble
But some shit you can't let slide - you gotta check that hoe
(Chorus: Twista)
If a nigga come at you like a lame or big slander your name
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe - if a nigga come at you in the club
Talkin' 'bout a bitch that you supposed to fuck
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe - you and somebody put in half and half
And he come back at you with twenty-five percent; then
You better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe - if you get played for a bird and some herb
All you got is your balls and your word
Nigga you better go check that hoe, you better go check that hoe
Fuck that hoe
(Twista)
I just wanted 'em to see what my CD was like
Hip-Hop is in a state as if it was a baby bein murdered
I just wanna feed in poetry breathin you life
I'm a black revolutionary in hip-hop
I just wanna hit the earth like a meteorite
Now droppin' lyrical bombs upon the planet
And just get a little dust and word out on media hype
Fuck the drama I'm just campaignin Chi right
Niggaz feel like they position is better than mine
But I stay on a mission, I'm on the grind
Takin' no prisoners I can see 'em gettin' mo' cheddar than mine
How I flow make the dough get larger
Take over with an immaculate verbal assault
Just to do it the way I'm doin' it, rollin' how I'm rollin'
Motherfuckers is gon' have to just go in the vault
Shit on niggaz in the oh-six Charger
When it come to titles you know that I'm holdin' 'em
I've been down since the days of breakin on linoleum
Till Kanye preach and ""Jesus Walks"" right up at the podium
Now let me speak about the prophecy of Twista
Just when you thought you worse, I'm bringin' you a hearse
I make you feel the heat and cold when I'm tellin' the street scroll
I got you feelin' the universe through the verse
The way I'm teachin it has got to be a scripture
So look at me like I'm a prophet on top of the game
Puttin' money in my pocket for the way a nigga rock it
And I bet if I'ma cock it I'm poppin' the thang
And if I ain't strapped then I gotta whup ass
So I take off my pinky ice; if a nigga come at me with some bullshit
Or fuck me out of money I steal on him like Winky Wright
Hit you with the left hook fast - you better check that hoe"

Butter pecan or vanilla, nipples and her pussy pink
(Hazel-eyed jet black baby hair that'll hurt yo' hearrrrrrt)
Have you ever seen a dark-skinned freak
Sexy and chocolate when she droppin' in, my African Queen
(When she starts what is she like a Hershey bar)
The three of us need to travel to an exotic place
Where y'all can double up on me, take me to outer space
Or we can keep it ghetto while hang in the hood on the porch
And later on we can fuck in front of the fireplace
But for now I'm only dippin through the block
Expressin to you all of the feelings in my chest
Wishin I could find a couple of girls on what I'm on
So they could help me end my stress, until then I'm just
(Chorus (w/ new ad libs))
(Twista + (Johnny P))
Look at lil' red
Talkin' jazzy at the mouth, 'cause she think she the shit
Thinkin' everybody around supposed to bow down to her
'Cause she's spoiled, but she's still my bitch
Now come take a look at miss black
Always got an attitude, and she stay on the attack
Why you always wanna whup a nigga ass, tellin' me I'm bogus
But I love you cause yo' ass so fat
So now I gotta pimp my ride
Custom material, computer, and chrome on the side
Paint job can make you look like butter rollin'
But you ain't rollin' unless you got some twenty-fo's on the ride
And the doors suicide
Niggaz hatin' but the bitches on the dick when the do's go up
Let the enemies see it good
When the homies in the ride and the forks and the fo's go up
... Steady bendin through the block, and I'm tryin' to find a ho
(And I'm pullin up with somethin' candy painted mayyyne)
Everybody call me Twista, representer for the city of the go
(Standin out on Madisson screamin out ain't it mayyyne)
Hit 'em with the one two three
(Chorus (w/ more different ad libs))
(Johnny P - repeat 2X to fade)
You know I love my chocolate fe's and my redbones
I still love my peanut butter and my caramel girls
I got love for my chocolate fe's and my redbones
I still love my peanut butter and my caramel girls"

Watch as I hit it through the middle of the city in the Chevy, and I'm ready with the woofers that'll beat up your block
And I got them takin' the machete for them niggas I could pay to get then get to talkin' I'ma heat up your block
If you wanna bring your boys, better bring the toys, better bring the noise, I'm bout to pop off (?) ammunition
Bodies I be hittin' when I get to spittin', everybody should have broken in, nobody listened, so now I
Roll on 24's when I'm on your tip, they all know who I am, ain't nobody talkin' shit, tell me when did they ever think that I was a hoe
'Cause I got killers with me, crips, bloods, g's and fours
And we be focused on the paper when we be up in the kitchen, we be thinking 'bout the money on a steady come up
And I got the niggas that be ready for whatever with a whole war chest if a nigga run up
AK 47, Desert Eagle, SK, Mac 11, for them niggas that'll try to run up
Nigga what you want, I'm a bone thug, get you while you sleepin' 'cause you know I'm creepin' on the come up

Mother fuckers actin' like they don't know the deal but they know just what to do
Everybody talkin' in the streets so you know that I'm comin' straight for you
'Cause I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of
--Verse 2 (Twista)
Try to play a nigga and get over onto Twista I'ma see you when I see you and I wouldn't wanna be you
Drop that Desert Eagle when I'm rollin' in a Regal when I'm lookin' at you evil through the eye of a needle
It's not a misdemeanor but a murder with a millimeter feel the heat of Twista when I'm bustin' at your wheel
I kill a burglar when I be comin' for your shit I'ma get you for your goods when I run up in your crib
Tell me where your jewelry at, where your safe, don't make me have to smack this ugly bitch in her face
Is it behind that portrait or is it in your floor
Just let me know so that I can hit it up 'cause I got to go
'Cause I gotta throw it so I hit a lick on them niggas 'cause it used to be that or I had to get 'em I'ma get 'em
Now I ride a burgundy Lamborghini Murcielago through the city because I know that'll kill 'em
Averaging a hundred yards per game, my competition better back up I'm the key running back
Niggas that ain't ready get the machete for the lyrical Jason of rap, I'ma keep coming back

Mother fuckers actin' like they don't know me, but they know just who I am,
I'm a mother fucking killer gorilla nigga you better act like you understand

--Verse 3 (Twista)
The lyrical assassin and I'm packin' a gat and I'll be attackin' the track up and I gotta package of the good
See a legendary representing for the city 'cause I put it down ever since I been rappin' in the hood
Seventeen years ago on the flow and the show and these niggas when it come to beatin' me, nobody could
I was spittin' venom ever since them days UGK be rappin' and talkin' bout puttin' diamonds on the wood
Rollin' in an old Cadillac before I got some fame
I done got that gwap and that number one spot, now I ride a range
And because I spit that crack is the reason we got some change
And if we ain't makin' money off rap then we got them things
Got the eight dollar hollers two for fifteens and four on the split and nine piece so you can hit the whole brick
How about makin' a hundred every summer, pullin' up in a Hummer can make a nigga so sick
How bout canceling come up with hits and steady be getting' fans only because a nigga flow sick
So with no debate, everybody know I'm great, any mother fucker that hate can suck my dick

Mother fuckers actin' like they don't know me, but they know just who I am,
I'm a mother fucking killer gorilla nigga you better act like you understand

Everybody got the memo, Michael Myers, man I'm mental
Messy murder monumental mixed my mind
Metamorphosis made it mainly my many maneuvers
Missin' my malice malevolent mister N9ne!
Mediocre motherfuckers my motive makin' minimum
Maniacal makin' me mesh my line
MONSTER! Musical massacre
Metaphysical minion may never match my grind
When I'm bustin' you think I'm poppin' the E
Hoppin' to Nina Boppin', need no stop and lockin' the B
Niggas be droppin' off in a coffin talkin' to me
Better flee, never see, Tecca Neez, I be forever
Look at the K.O.D. demolish, I'm polished
I get dollars, I get more guala, mixologist, and many I sell
You will never see the light of day right away
You will die but I hide away, say goodbye, (I'll see you in Hell)
True shots, a-who's stopped the crew's water?
You soft, I move rocks, a Mustafa
Boondock ya boo, So-Woo, what the?
Through chakras, you lost the new nana
Out with the weak and in with the raw
Put you in deep and have your mama seekin' the law
Freaking the beat, I get to peekin'
Leavin' you mauled with the saw
Ain't nobody beatin' me in a brawl
Y'all got to know, I stop the show
Pick you off of the pillar, you know I drop the foe
Sick of an abyss of sicker suckers, sock a ho
Nigga, oh, you ain't even in my optical
I'll shock ya though, I rock the flow
Nah, not so low like burnin' optimo
Wassup to Joe from my block, the MO
I did it to death 'n' my nigga I got to go!
It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth
It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event
Of verbal annihilation if you don't know the truth
It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in a rage
It can be an emergency, making you have to evacuate the premises, killing the audience up on the stage
We are an anomaly, coupling up and stomping them up in the gut
You gotta be loving the cut, if I get to fucking 'em up
I'm probably bustin' 'em up and vodka be up in the cup
And drama be nothing to us
A combination of some oddities coming to crush
And y'all will be nothin' to touch, your body, we cutting 'em up
Twista ready to bang and Tech got his face painted
Like we bout to go and do a robbery up in a truck
Whenever you recollect it, me and Tech will tackle niggas
And see 'em like Liam Neeson in Taken
Or Taken 2, better yet, Tekken 2
Wrecking you like I was Baek or Eddy
I'm ready to reappear like I was Yoshimitsu
From a darker side of the universe
You would verse a predator is what you didn't know
When they will go and get you
Then I'm immediately about to punish him, run, it's a mutation
Of horror that'll treat you like a ho and hit you
But Tech, me and you can speak on it, even type of terminology
And hurt 'em as if they didn't know we were an odyssey or an oddity
It's a murder probably, if not then I bet you that we cause a verbal lobotomy
Tell them niggas to make a move, then when I move, I wanna bruise
And show 'em they finna lose, and I refuse to be a fool
I kill 'em and keep it cool, but I'mma do what I'mma do
Because I'm breakin the rules, let's go
Bust you with lyrics, how we shoot this
Or either we gon' say ""fuck you"" while chucking up the deuces
The booth is where the living proof is, and I'm ruthless
I can leave your whole team's caduceus in nooses, ooh, it's
Somebody you don't really want to get into it with
I'm mythical, difficult and I don't know if it'll
Be a wise thing for you to do as far as tangling with the unusual
Orion, I'm iron, I'm scientifical
Indivisibility within the infrastructure of the family
That I created is inevitable
Especially if we committed to getting money
So fuck the haters because it's the paper that you better get, you
Take your mental into space and leave it alone
An outer dimension because I can get deep with a song
The look of a fiend, I'mma put 'em to sleep with the chrome
Unlock the machine, fuck him if he ain't breathing alone, die
It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth
It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event
Of verbal annihilation if you don't know the truth
It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in a rage
It can be an emergency, making you have to evacuate the premises, killing the audience up on the stage
We are an anomaly, coupling up and stomping them up in the gut
You gotta be loving the cut, if I get to fucking 'em up

In the Chi, it's kill or be killed, hussle or die
You gotsta take the pie, momma didn't lie
Look in my eyes you see the realness
The nine makes you feel this
The pain that I'm going through till I'm sitting on millions
My minds on that paper, wishin' upon a caper
I need to stack now, I will pay for my sins later
When I'm living greater, the mind state of a Westside native
It's sick in the head, dodgin' Feds everyday
See me load the AK, watch 'em run when we spray
Get the fuck up out my way and for pray that this pistol play
'Cause when I'm heated I'm gunning till there's nothing in sight
So cancel Christmas muthafucka, fuck you and your life
(Mayz)
Niggas in my mob is too suave
We ride hundred G cars, in it like the world is ours
Don't disrespect or get your chest split like cigars
In this county of crooks tryin' to avoid jail bars
But it's so hard to make cheese especially
If you ain't got no Ph.D. or connect on phat keys
See mobstability is for niggas with nothing to lose
Going psycho from this drama you go through paying dues
I get a buck in your side tryin' to hussle for a ride
Or hittin' the block to find out one of your guys just died
So don't come to the Chi, it's just risky as hell
'Cause K-Town niggas'll bomb on that ass like a stealth
In the county of crooks: gangbangers, killers and slangers
With judges be quick to hang us homies and strangers
No bluffin', we bustin'
Like a kamikaze, watch our bodies come up
War (?) then it's on, now we gon' strap up, what's up
(Newsense)
Our county's so crooked, Psycho Drama invented the style
Then damn near everybody took it and passed it around
Now these muthafuckas all look and see 'cause we puttin' it down
And ain't no sooner or later, the world gon' realize they fakin'
Then snatch they tapes of the shelves and break 'em, eliminate
'Em
Just as fast as Creator's Way can create shit
Now they all on some hation, just like them nigga
Like ain't nobody done a thing
But we run a reason around these bitches
The more tapes we make the more they all go broke, so fuck 'em
If it ain't no love then it ain't none
If it is, then nigga then say something
'Cause more of this beats gon' stomp and keep on stompin'
And Drama make that solemn promise
That shorty flyin' all on niggas' business

Come look around Crook County, look around, you found me
I must've been bad to the bone, get the mask and the chrome
This Chi gotta die from a blast to the dome
Nigga, not muthafuckin' Ouija board
I receive my blessings from G's and Lord, nine-millies and
Source
But the art of war nigga, must've found breathin' bored
Tellin' me to look into your eyes, all I see is a bitch
Tell Krayzie in New Orleans that he bit
Talkin' about you was lovin' my shit
Hit the bud and got sent on that shit odyssey mumblin' r&b
You can keep the apology, you gon' try to dishonor me
Kill the Hoes of the Harmony
Just when you thought it was safe
The Bone niggas 'bout to get slaughtered and raped
I can slow down and audit the tape
Y'all bent and all y'all who thought it was fake
Now watch (?) on the stage, beef and the rage
Die on the first on the month, 'cause it's than the blunt
Why would you compete to be doomed, now you gon' see Eazy-E soon
Feel the boom of the reprecussion, 'cause the reefer's still
Rushin'

Pop a nigga off as if you were champagne
Put 'em in the ambulance but ain't no resuscitation
'Cause he done got knocked off, point-blank range
It's a crisis the way niggas will pull up and shoot
Last week, the streets just put him in a coupe
This week, the streets just put him in a suit
Six feet under with dirt on top of the roof
Put 'em in a grave, people standin' over your body
And they wonderin' if your soul'll be saved
Or if it has risen or if it will be forbidden, by the way
You was doin' shit, they could've put you in prison
Now you ain't with the livin'
Cause you weren't a shooter or didn't know how to shoot
Either way feel inferior, I make the block cripple

Gun up on the passenger side of the vehicle, he hit you
With the artillery simply 'cause he didn't like you
Should've knew not to piss him off
Catch a disease of a gun cause it'll cough
Better watch your mouth if you see some grown folks
About higher pedigree, especially if it be a boss
These lil' niggas ain't playin'
Soon as you come up and start talkin' shit, then they sprayin'
(?Want you to ride in the whip, then they stand?)
Soon as they see the nigga hit, then they ran
Straight got ghost, they don't wanna [?] a nigga
That comin' at 'em ambitiously with the toast
Point-blank range if you let 'em too close
Scene of a homicide, body was lookin' gross
Prob'ly off with your head, if him in the scene
Was comin' to the war cryin' soft like [?]
And this ain't no Walking Dead, they get rid of you
If they dumped a body and a white chump might talk
No talkin' to the Feds, they hit 'em fast
Try to retaliate, but they gon' get his ass
And they ain't gon' be able to revive him in the ambulance
They just gon' pick him up and zip him in a bag

Little bit; so go on with the riddle shit
If you got something to stress then get it off your chest and
We can take it to the middle bitch
And go on get it on and I bet you that the outcome is that I'm leavin'
Niggas out done, cut up
But its odd to see a motherfucker outrun just because he let his
Mouth run so shut up
And sit back if you know what's good for you I can still overthrow you
I don't give a fuck about the fact that the hood know you
Don't make a nigga have to show you
That Ima die before you make an ass of me stop as if you took a blast
At me and cause tragedy
That was how it was that was how it is and that's the way it has to be
It's like uh, ah, sit back and let the shit just straight marinate
I pull the stage curtain back like norman bates
Performin hates smokin' on some reefer performin fate
It's a constant struggle for us white boys with the shit hittin licks
In the scuffle for us
My nigga lucky made him bleed fear is if to proceed to bust
If he a different type of breed from us
So y'all petty niggas need to hush; two straight to you brain means pains
Inflicted
Even if it ain't things to taunt pain like rage till my brain is wicked
Ain't even lived out a quarter of your lifetime tryin' to push product
And ain't servin' the right kind and ain't strivin the right rhymes
But Ima shorten your lifeline
Through the pipeline I vocal cold bust 'em plus them with killers
Jaw stealers throw dealers rushin parties bloody body chillers
Pretty casket fillers
'Cause those niggas got they shit together
We come pay to Creator's Way and don't gotta be but then again whatever"

I got it on me for any pussy nigga that push me
If I want it, I take it, angel of Satan
I'm a hitter for hitters, just know that Jesus was waiting
Black on my gloves, black on my mask
It's a funeral, nigga, that's on the gas
Life, I'mma take it, angel of Satan
I'm a hitter for hitters, just know that Jesus was waiting
Far from a angel, more like a devil
Black SUVs, heavy metal, got my foot on the pedal
Murdering you right where you stand if I ever catch you
I can fill your back up with shells from this .38 special
Won't stop till I murder every rapper, I'm finna replenish
Went through a killing spree for years and I never repented
Father, forgive me, I sinned and have no problem admitting
I'm like God to these bitches, my only problem's a mitten
Got black on my gloves, black on my mask
Shoot every hit, miss and I'm coming back on yo' ass
I won't hold back, I'mma blow and knock you flat on yo' ass
My lil' niggas'll blow and they ride for the cash
I'm a hitter for hitters, I sold my soul to the streets
These motherfuckers thought I sold my soul to the beast
Don't give a fuck about the murder rate, I'll help it increase
I got the realer gorilla shit embedded in me
If I should die right now, I pray my dark soul you can keep
'Cause I'm corrupted, I hang with killers, gangstas, elites
I'm up in this bitch wildin' for Chiraq, what you think?
I catch him in traffic, wreck it and rock him to sleep

Politicking with gangstas and fucking with bitches
But never lock and try me, the shit'll get different
They know that I keep it on me and God as my witness
I been the business, why they think I'm holding the torch
I was only 12 or 13 when I first rapped on the porch
Battling niggas up in the park, I wasn't playing no sports
Man, I wanted the whole thing, I wasn't taking no shorts
I call up the guys, and we take a ride
If we catch you lacking, nigga, then we getting fire
'Cause we tryna rock you, don't wanna see you alive
If we slide up on him, Swiss cheese him, he won't survive
I'm telling you niggas ain't ready, bitch, any nigga could get it
Money, power and pussy, yes, that's my religion
Proper preparation prevents poor performance in winning
I'm from where them niggas ain't hungry but they stay in the kitchen
I tell they mama to pray, look, bitch, I'm God
I know I sinned in the past but I beat the odds
I put in work, I did it for squad

Life, pain
It's so hard to survive in this world of pain
I feel like I'm goin' crazy so I'ma shell my brain
My niggaz out here droppin' off over rocks and thangs
Mama never told me life was such a dirty game
(Lifty Stokes)
I hold my glock to my chest, yes my steel is cold
I pray to God to come to rescue me and save my soul
I reminisce on my past life
Ever since I was a young shorty I didn't act right
Live for the street life
Yellin', ""What it be like?""
Nigga we Folks
Money makin' hustlaz from the Westside and it shows
In these past years, shit it's been a hell of 25
Back in '91, I didn't even think I'd be alive
I was sellin' jewelry to rocks, and rocks to weed
Off at the comfort zone G with a fifth of T's and B's
Ready to do whatever, young with a pocket full of cheddar
No thoughts of stackin' just ballin', picture me fallin' nigga never
In this lifetime
But I had to grieve for awhile
Cause a nigga fell off hard but I got my ass back on the grind
And hit the streets like a mad man, goin' against the grain
With dried tears on my face from the pain of this dirty game
(Hook 2x's)
(Todd Nitty)
Fresh out the pen and can't maintain
Wanna go and hit the block, be on the same thang
Tryin' to serve some cain up in this dirty game
Cause you did a lil' bit, think ain't shit changed
You wrong boy, these shorties out here misled
You fuck around and catch a bullet in yo forehead
Ya heard me?
This ain't the 80's where you get a nickel sack and a hoodrat
A 40-ounce of Red Bull and blow yo wig back
Nigga fuck that, this the year 2-G
Where the toughest muthafucka get left 6-feet deep
So don't sleep, cause the scariest nigga'll pull the trigga
Put 2 in 300 pounds, so that makes you a killa
Oh really, could you be that silly
To think you gon' take over a block where I be ?? nigga forget it
Don't make me have to blow yo brains
In this fucked up world, this fucked up life, this fucked up game
(Hook 2x's)

Hey nug, for some reason at night I can't sleep
When I lay down, I keep tossin' and turnin'
There's somethin' wrong but I don't know what's wrong with me
Eyes burnin'
Cause sometimes I burst into tears when ain't nobody home with me
Stress from thoughts of survival just rushed my dome quickly
Y'all better come on get me
'Cause I bout to do somethin' so muthafuckin' drastic
Instead of writin' essays like grabbin' SK's
With one of the best ways that I know to feed my family
Cause y'all ain't foolin' me
Y'all people plannin' a way for my people to read my eulogy
I see what y'all bogus ass doin', y'all plannin' on hurtin' me
Used to be crucifyin' or burnin' me
Now you eliminatin' paper currency
Terrorizin' with technology
And that Y2K shit, I don't know why you play with the chosen guys
The wool ain't no longer pulled over my eyes
Gots to get some scratch and I gotta get it soon
We about to be doomed
Do somethin' for the kids before I go to my tomb
Gotta bust this thang and maybe then thangs gon' change
Tryin' to check mine, cause all of it on y'all I can't blame
Maintain, it's a strange game
At times you gotta throw blows for the gold
It's a long road, some of us do shit despite losin' our soul
Got cold flows but it's strange, I still can't get no change
Bout to be insane
Tryin' to pay the bills but still straight causin' pain
It's a dirty game

I could tell when I dropped the top
I nippled off on the block, I was gon' get into some bullshit
That's the reason why I watch for cops
And keep me two baby glocks, both of 'em loaded with a full clip
Still I gotta be on a mission for paper
But later on I'ma be hangin' out with everybody
Never knew I shoulda been scared of the hottie
I got up with later on at the R. Kelly party
So I pull up the club in the Coupe
Look at how them jeans huggin the boots
Saw me ippy uppy icy as hell, f'rilla good smell
Have you ever seen a thug in a suit? Jackin bitches up
Socializin with everybody flirtin with girls but got plans to go home
Till I felt the way you was backin up on the thang
Gettin' down on the flo' I could see the top of the thong
She a (bad muh'fucker) she could bass a deuce
A fine-ass Medusa make your dick turn to stone
Take a look at the thong, get in the zone, took a shot of Patron
And I was gone, she a (bad muh'fucker)
Take a look at them hips, and how she lickin' them lips
Like she was lickin' ice cream
Ballin with a bad bitch that ain't yours on the scene
Listenin to some Al Green might (""make you do wrong"")

And then unlocked the lock, the Queen 'bout to get her bang on
I don't know what I'ma tell my dawg
When he look up and realize that a bitch ain't came home
Shit, he about to be rockin' it
Lookin' sweeter than chocolate, he got the smell of a Reese's
Break a fella to pieces, it's a hell of a thesis
Adjustin his body with telekenesis
Got on top and then he knocked me off, until he was soft
Got in the car and dropped him off
Tryin' to sink down as low as I can up in my seat
'Cause I'm rollin' in the Hummer and the top was off
My guy sleepin' anyway and that's whassup
But I'm paranoid, drivin' fast as fuck
Thinkin' 'bout what I did, I try to sneak in the crib
Here come my man in the front, askin me what (""make you do wrong"")

To go there we can get in this bitch (wee straight)
Ballin for scratch ready to die for this shit

Don't you know that talking shit ain't wise
Nigga I'll advise you and your guys to get the fuck outta my presence
I got trigger eyes
Venom plower situations reaping bloody demonstrations when the heat dies
You won't see guys conversating
Only homicides and yellow tapings
No suspect no motives mad villains living bogus
If we don't catch you you best believe we tag whoever closest
And make you feel the motions
Turtle Banxx got kill notions that's real potent
Have you ever see I still smoking
Senile emotions you'll soul cokeland
Not a body open fuck ABC's
Best to be on P's and Q's I'ma get diseases if you snoozes
You ready yet?
You better study your tech and be a threat fucking coward
Or face trigger vests with celeb ways to wreck
Off with all heads and all bets
I'm on your neck sending straight .57 threats at your neck nigga
Straight .57 till your face don't blink
Nowhere to run no time to think
So what you wanna do when it's on like that
In a chill when we steal and your soul get snatched out ya body
Shotties to your face don't blink
Nowhere to run no time think
So what you wanna do when it's on like that
In a chill when we steal and your soul get snatched out ya body
Catch me with a semi on cop
Been in your block dumping 17 shots in your spot
Putting niggas in shops ready for a box
Made my getaway slick as a fox
Taking the ditches the cops
Escaping visions of prisons and locks
My mission don't stop no pot to piss in so the plot thickens
I keep hearing gats clicking
See I'm into strange places
Wear a mask to cover up they faces if they want me why they procrastinate
Is it just in oasis?
Perpetrated by my imagination
Apple Texas trojan am I tasting
My own death gun fire got me toned deaf
So I say a silent but I save my ownself
Can you clone death?
Like they do life I see the blue light hearing the sirens
Amongst the madness and the violence gun firing
Tragedies of lying in to I want a murderous round boy
That let niggas don't talk infa-red triggers caulk
A nigga trying to cheat life
Now death says name affiliation in the street life
I see nights away from the mics
Far from the henny and ice where many ya like for the riches and life
While shaking the device with a camera device like dice
From pistol fights nickel hypes murder and mics is life
In the Chi and Suge Knight
So think twice or faces vicious types in pit fights
The blocks hotted the cops watching for anything unusual happen
They been stoping profits three days in tracking
Drug traffic distracting clientele with drug habits
Load them thangs and make them slugs happen
Enemies of surprise got 'em frantic
Scattered and panicked damaged by any 11
Ducked behind a treasure box let 'em have it
Managed to get away hide away your weapons
Probably still there but they ain't telling
Belling to the bank for my safe deposit
Gotta take my grub on these narcotics properly watching
With a copy of my face composite
Description all the way down to the J's I'm rocking
Laser dots and the ducking police dogs hunting
Resistin everything I'm touching
Blood running down from the barbwire bloodening
Choppers hovering sirens coming closer
Grab our toaster, I'm supposed to surrender
But I done heard the shots from the trigger of a
Yeah yeah
You see man
I told you man
Get them niggas man

Damn, I'm trippin' 'cause I never really felt like this
To me women used to be only fuck boxes
But it's like with you I cherish every kiss
I know it's a risk but you make me wanna come clean
I wanna make you my queen
Put you in a crib and give you plenty green
To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams
Only for your love I fiend
'Cause the way you put it on me make me wanna scream
And fuck you in places you ain't never seen
In a private boat as we float down stream
Yeah I already know you done heard this before
But the way you make me feel is real
Playas don't love no hoes but stayin' true like you do
Got me head over heals, so tell me what's the deal, baby
'Cause you lookin' too fine to not be mine
And I ain't gon' never be satisfied
Unless you're on my side to the end of time
I can tell you think I'm lying

You stay on my mind, even in my sleep
You keep a nigga havin' wet dreams, on the real

Wearin' black and white and some brand new Mike's
Draped in ice, attitude nice

To add a little spice, cookin' nigga steak and rice
I can see ud one day man and wife
Walkin' down the aisle, havin' our first child
Plus our marriage worth while
With a brand new lifestyle, I could walk that mile
But baby I need you right now
In my arms caressin' me
I can see your eyes undressing me
Girl it's destiny and love is the recipe
But this way's got the best of me
On everything, I can guarantee you better things
If you just get rid of ""what's his name""
And let me in your world
So I can show you, baby, that my love is real and not a game
So can a brother come through
So I can show you, boo, just exactly what I mean
It don't matter if you fuck me tonight or next month
Babe, only time can reveal a dream

Think I'm ever gon' give your love away, uh-uh
I ain't sayin' I'm never lovin' 'em and I ain't studdin' 'em but shit
I'm cravin' you every night and we just met on the ninth
But it seems like I've been knowin' you all my life
Ain't it funny how you be thinkin' you never be true to none, but you the one
I helplessly succumb, lovin' you more than everything
But my dollars, family, and smokin' sticky up through the lungs
I can see you havin' my son, screamin' your name on my next tape
Lettin' the city know, here my pretty go
Quick to break a 54, put you on my video
Young and witty hoe, the only fee I fit a pretty foe

My every heartbeat's weaker, follow the leader
Promise I won't hurt you baby
Don't feel the heatseaker 'cause we gon' be smokin' on sweet cheeba
Take my boo-boo to the mall and go shopping until we fall
Get you the finest things like diamond rings
Even though my mind is strange, I'm tryin' to change
How we fuck and kiss and the hugging make me blind to pain
No lying, no games, you gon' give me some, hey now, we freakin' up in the cut

Yeah how I spit it was fuckin' her up

I know you heard the terms chicks are like cars
Well I treat bitches like drinks
When I step in the club and by out the bar
So let me quench my thirst with you and a friend
Instead of the juice and gin
Why don't I pour out the drink and you hop in
Glass full of ass for a true motherfucker
With that that turquoise Coogi on
You remind me of a blue motherfucker
Your friend was sexy when I seen her in Prada
But I think Gina was hotter
Cause her skin tone was like a piña colada
I saw two Japanese chicks that got bodies
So I ordered them a mai tai and hot sake, then I got cocky
And asked them do they come to this club a lot
Well ya got a brotha hot
Hop in my bubble drop
Can I get a double shot?
Or get wit these two mamacita's one wit the karma of margarita
The other one like two shots of tequila
And they all fine I really don't know what to think
As I get bubbly and choose and try to figure out
(Chorus: Highbeam)
What's my favorite Drink?
Girl can I sip on you
Sip on you

What's my favorite drink?

Don't want the middle Cosmopolitan ass
I like the one that makes your face drop like a Neopolitan mast
No telling what these thick bitches would do
Reminiscent of a big old pitcher of brew
But hit ya like a slow screw
Dip in a strip a club in LA with a bankroll
Where the weather ain't cold
So I can see some hoes slide down a poll
I met two dancers named Moet and Cristal
I was checkin' they style
We had a session It was wet it was wild
Then I dug these two twins thick wit Hennessey one was Remi Red
With skinny legs
Both of them game to give me head
With a little bit absolute vodka for they homie Tasha
Tell her to come closer
So y'all three can give me a Sammy Sosa
If I was mayor I would campaign ass
Drunk politician with women swimming around the champagne glass
Drink so much that I might hurl in the sink
And if you ask me why
I couldn't figure out

I wish I could pour some of you in a bishop's cup
And have a toast wit King Boo
And celebrating the fact that you thick as fuck
I holla Church cause its pimps in the party
Let me sip on ya body
Get a good buzz of ya like you lemon Bacardi
Or a long Island havin' sex on the beach
Or in the 'llac sunroof let back with the tech on the seat
Got a red bone I call her strawberry daquiri
Bring her back for me
Carry packs for me
Had her suck off my facultay
Got a little mamma name Mimi
Who remind me of Martini and Asti Spumante
How she move to my CD
I got a chocolate chick who deep throat
She help me shake up dope
She the complexion of Crown Royal and Coke
And they making it hard for me to decipher and think
As I get bubbly and choose

Now is she bold G? But in my mouth is where the gold be
'Cause I be pimpin' her like Goldie
Gotta get paid in this age my fingers ain't made
Just to be choppin up confetti with, if it's already thick
You better study nigga if you ain't with it you can get it
'Cause I ain't even on that petty shit
So who the fuck do I competi with?
The rhythm I kick, is like a rhythmly-wicked-arith-a-metic
Pick 'em up quick and then give 'em the dick, thinkin' I'm innocent
They up in the mall shoppin' for me pickin' a fit
I got them heffer's nose red
And when we get in the bed, I be leavin' 'em with rose legs
Stuffin that made 'em wanna pose dead
But you already got 'em until you get up in them hoes head
I don't mean to sound bogus or nothin'
But it's the bomb when I be havin' them cuties thinkin'
I'm in love with em, when I'm rubbin em
Be gettin' pub with em, in a club with em
Smokin' dub with em, huggin em, freakin in the tub with em
After gettin' paid from her she ain't trippin'
'Cause she know she got what she paid for
She honor my name, I gotta tame, here it go
Now we speakin' with the game on ways to make mo'

To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that...
Tell me baby can you buy that
I got you under my complete control, you know it's worth more than
Diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that
Verse Two: Twista
Now how the fuck you gon' act hoe, I saw you creepin' out the back do'
What you runnin' from a mack fo'? Lay you on your back slow
Cause you know I got you with my lasso
Blow your mind like a afroCome and take a glimpse of the stairs
It's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I betcha notice the smell
It's like a lotus when I flow dis, cause my eyes be the lowest
If you didn't notice then you bogus as hell
I'm puttin' women under my spell, like I'm up in their brain
Pumpin their vein with game for the anatomy that's feminine
They're fillin 'em up with adrenaline, got 'em geekin
We're speakin' approachin up a pimp like a gentleman
Submission is surrenderin, it ain't no endin if it's on
With a blunt from the bomb side
In the right place, with the right mind and the right line
You can get a lifetime contract
They be wise until they look into your eyes
A shorty freaked when she spotted mine
Took her over to my crib, lay low, hit her off from behind
Then she signed on the dotted-line, the hoe was like
""Ooh Daddy... why you doin' me like this?
I'd do anything to be with you, you got me gone in the head""
Ya mind, I don't mean to make a disaster up
Like my Dad to master love
But if a motherfucker breakin you for every penny you earn
Then how could you still show the bastard love?
I guess it's 'cause I'm cold, shit
Thought you was gon' be spendin me I betcha think you sho' did
But game recognize game, now you lame in the brain
Stupid bitch that's what you get for tryin' to gold dig, now
Yeah, this be Hype, the Verbal Tantrum
Kickin it with my man Twista
If you should suck my soul
I should make your funky emotions
Nothin' is good unless you play with it
Play with me baby
Verse Three: Twista
I know you think it's blasphemy
But won't you give up when she ask for me? After he passed the beat
Since you said I was your Magesty, I had to see
And when you get paid, there is some cash for me, is it a tragedy
That I can get her so gone, the hoe be trippin' talkin' up her love a lot
But the only love I got, is when I'm grippin like I wanna hug the Glock
Or when I rub the twat, or pickin' up a dub at spots
Fuck the hoe thugs, the clubs, and the phony perpetrators with dimes
The speed knots match voo-Do or Die, Psycho Drama, Crucial Conflict
Be pimpin' with 'em gators and dons, collect the papers and dolls
Player haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust
Sso keep walkin' the next time you hear grown folks talkin'
Motherfuckers betta shut the fuck up, 'cause we make the women suck up
You insist to be trippin' while we be gamin like Don Juan
What up the filet minion, the grey poupon
Them hoes are staked to charm, because we make the bomb
Now I don't mean no harm, but either come on in or get on gone
And let me pull my pouch of snuff
In between your thighs, come take a pull and vibe
And let your tongue go coastin low, now"
41,Emotions (Remix),1997,Adrenaline Rush (1997),Midwest Rap,Twista,"(Johnny P)
I can get inside your head
All day everyday, and play with your emotions...
Let me get inside your head
All day, everyday, and play with your emotions...
(Twista over P in background)
Huh... yeah it's Twista again y'know
These females be trippin' me out y'know?
Certain stuff they be sayin'
Like this other female she came up to me
(This other female she came up to me)
She said a little somethin' like this
(She said a little somethin' like this)
(Twista)
I thought you love me though? Now how you gonna be wrong
Just 'cause you know you got me gone in the head?
You be twistin with the lovely flow, but whatchu actin' all ugly fo'?
Left me alone in the bed
Where you goin' 'cause I'm not done, cool till you got some
Trippin' when I got sprung, but you ain't fly love
You da shit but your petty money can't but love
Is that what I does? My reply was, you know why 'cause
I could tell you was prone-to-bone niggaz I hang around
But the reefer I was zonin on, make me the one you freakin on da mo'
From how I lay you down
Now you trippin' 'cause I'm not attached, hangin' with a lot of rats
Her concerned whether I'ma act
Now you the momma mack, comin' back with a lot of scratch
Go on witcha bad ass, but I gotta catch
I done peeped the way you look into my nigga's eyes
I done recognized that I won't be hypnotized
Criticized, no more inner cries, now I'm ener-gized
With my eyes on the prize just a flick of thighs
I can't let nobody ride with me that'll lie to me
Smokin' stanky up and play with me the way you do
And you trippin' 'cause I played you too? Sho' you right
Take the whole thing in stride like the way I do
And let me play with your emotions slow
(Chorus: Johnny P, Twista)
I can get inside you head
All day, everyday, and play with your emotions
(T) Let me play with your emotions slow
To the rhythm of a kick-drum, take a body get sprung
Let me stimulate your mind, body, and soul
You know I got a quick tongue, so if you want some get some
Let me get inside your head
Everyday, all day, and play with your emotions
(T) Let me play with your emotions slow
To the rhythm of a kick-drum, take a body get sprung
Let me stimulate your mind, body, and soul
You know I got a quick tongue, so if you want some get some
(Twista)
Now tell me how you gon' act though? I saw you creepin' out the backdo'
Whatchu run up on my mack fo'?
Lay you on your back slow cause you know I got you with my lasso
Blow your mind like an afro
Come and take a glimpse of the stairs
It's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I bet you notice the smell
It's like a lotus when I flow this, cause my eyes be the lowest
If you didn't notice, then you bogus as hell
I'm puttin' woman under my spell, lock them up in the brain
Pimpin' her vain with games with the anatomy that's feminine
Then fillin them up ""Adrenaline""
Got 'em geekin we're speakin' approachin up a pimp like a gentleman
Submission and surrenderin and ain't no end in it
If it's on with a blunt from my bomb sack
In the right place with the right mind and the right line
You can get a lifetime contract
Then be wise until I look into your eyes
Now shorty freaked when she spotted mine
Took her over to my crib laid low hit it raw from behind
Then she signed on the dotted line, and she was like...
(Ooh daddy... don't make me feel like this...
I don't want nobody else, you got the bomb!)
Your mind I don't mean to make a disaster of
Like when daddy mastered love
But if a bogus brother breakin you for every penny you earn
Then how could you still show the bastard love?
I guess I'm with a cold clique
Thought you was gon' be spendin me? I bet you think you sho' did
But game recognize game now you lame in the brain stupid trick
That's what you get for tryin' to gold-dig
Now let me play with your emotions slow
(Twista)
Whassup girl? It's the Twista and the Verbal Tantrum once again
With a sack big enough for me and a friend
You do know how to roll B's don't you?
Well let's fill one up with a dub and a little bit of love
And take it to the head
For some of this long-lastin blunt passion
(Twista)
I know you think it's blasphemy
But won't you show my boys and pass for me, after he past the B?
Since you said I was your majesty, I had to see
And when you get paid then push some cash to me
Is it a tragedy, that I can get her so gone
That she be trippin' talkin' up ""I love a lot""
But the only love I got, is when I grip a mic
Or when I hug the glock or when I rub the twat
I'm pickin' up a dub in spots, skip the studs in the clubs
And the phony perpetrators with jobs
The Speedknot, Psycho Drama shocked the world
Triple Dark, there's a Conflict, be pimpin' 'em with gators 'n' darts
Collectin papers 'n' gobs
Playa haters remarks'll get smoked to a blunt dust
So keep walkin' and next time you hear grown folks talkin'
Other people better shut the (fuck) up
'Cause I make the women suck up
You insist to be trippin' when we be gamin like Don Juan
Without the filet mignon and Grey Poupon
The thieves just ain't the charm because I made the bomb?
Now I don't mean no harm; but either come on in or get on gone
Now watch me live a kosher flow
In between your thighs come take a pull and divide
But let your tongue go coastin low
Now let me play with your emotions slow"

Hit a big head later Mr. Lease Split Wig
Fucked around nigga 15, I spend

Smoked out tent no need to see me
Unless I'm creeping up on you in black and 3-D
Laying my stunt get down
Like a Westside clown is supposed to, smoking bi-coastal
A nigga got connections in the game because I'm old school
Lay down, let chop change now, we
Double up the money so we can paint the town
And grab hoes down like rebounds
And let 'em shake that ass while I crank the sound
See I'm fresh off the lot in a brand new drop
Glistness screaming fuck the cops
I got four bitches that's about to pop
With dro smoke coming out top
When you fresh off the lot in a brand new drop
You got some binning grinning hit some blocks
Spend the club hit the club like I'm always popped
Now it's time to see some asses drop

What's popping, drop the top and let's see what's cracking
Look it's Saturday nights on Madison
After that imagine what happens since I'm blasting
And he hits the action I'm mashing and henny mixed in the passion
Got me dipping in and out of traffic
On point for them blue lights flashing
Two nice scratching now hotels
On crunk so drunk I'm bout to go fell
Oh well, hit the lick and sto' for more bail
Followed by a gang of hoes and bout to go now
Twista say he got a spot where the dro sell
Liffy say we gotta stop 'fore we go bail, yeah
Let's ride but only if you party hoe
When the door, know you sexy working that body yo
I know you in love with a thug nigga, get you buy your drinks
Take pictures inside the club with you, grab your girls and let's roll

Now I just pulled out the lot up in a hard top
Standing on chrome footage that is on my block
This rich nigga behind me who was in a drop top ride was trying to clown
Eyes bucked when he saw my shit dro back and drop down
I could drop the top off of anything, but I be surgical
Leave the dealership in a convertible that'll murder you
Heard a few hoes hollered at me when I blast
I love 'em stand up in the backseat, pop that ass
Put them titties on the glass when y'all lay up on the hood
All up in the hood, after I left silly where I hood
Got some leather interior all my rides got chrome
Pac song, cause my b-hees come up with the top gone
In the winter time, I might spend some g's on a fur
At the Spring Bling holla at her please run through my hair
Sporty hummer for summer if I crash the motherfucker
I just throw it in the gutter, and go buy another"

On the porch, on the porch
Smokin' reefa
Hmmm yeah
(Liffy Stokes)
I woke up early Saturday morning sick off Rhemy and brews
Wit a hang over from blues
Hurl on my clothes and shoes stomach on wooz
From this killer weed that's so fired it made your nose bleed
I had me so high, my brain was fried movin at slow speed
This thick bitch chose me and was stickin like liquor
She look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like ""Dick her""
But wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken
I swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken
I remember wakin' up at the flat fucked up in the back
Checkin' on my weed and scratch I damn near fell out the lat
I hit the sack to sleep it off woke up woozy and still smoking
Twistin swishers thinking about last night and the bitch that was scopin
Fuck it let's get 'em on I grabbed the phone ""Girl call your friends""
Then I hit Twista and Maze and them 'bout the bitch in the Benz
Nigga push only 'cause I see them already been in the block
You know the lit niggas you'll find us in my favorite spot
And that's on
The front porch smoking reefa
The weed got 'em feelin' umm hmm
On the front porch getting deeper
Ghetto love got 'em feelin', umm hmm yeah yeah

In the summer I hit the front porch wit a morning B
Sippin on the duce duce OZ
And I be killin' me how many thick fees I see
Getting bubbly waitin for Stokes and T, I spit a little game at three
Tryin' to talk up on the shoppin' spree
Or a B of that stinky green free
Straight getting, to puff puff pass
And drive up my gas hittin all the hot blocks
Bumpin ""Legit Ballers"" to ""Rock Y'all Spot""
Everybody know the shit 'bout to drop
See from Northbound to Ten Row in it go tryin' to get they props
Pollutin the air wit squares, blunts, and tops
Settin up shops for lots comin' back nots
Each and everyday of the week
The Mobsta Elites be on somebody porch dumpin heat
Bustin' flows in the cipher getting deep
While we cheat something sweet to Legendary beats
Till we reached our peak
Scummy aloud attractin crowds to the street
Then it's time to retreat grab something to eat
And head to the late front to get up wit some freaks
Wit a treat under the seat
For the cats who get the sudden urge and wanna try to jack
'Cause when your pockets is fat
It seems like all the haters and hood-rats want to attack
And when the park close we hit the liquor store
For a box of Sitches and a fifth of Yak
South on the corner and get a few sacks
Or betta yet the whole pack so we can get back
On the

One morning I
Woke up next to a chocolate fee and a red bone
My dick was hard I started stroking and poking
After toppin I tell them to role the blunt
Cause on the front I hear them niggas steady smoking and jokin
I heard it's gonna be hot outside gotta get up and lay my clothes out
It's gonna be too many hoes out
Before my ladies rolled out I got 'em to clean up the whole house
Then I threw my fit on look in the mirror get on gone
""Nigga you looking dope because you got a knot""
Ain't no cruising up out the hop
I'm hangin' by the spot 'cause I had to put the Lexus off up in the shop
But it's all to good it's a hood thang
Never too bogus notice the love on the block that nigga coolin
Aiming the radio out the window steady grooving
Tip by the corner store wit the indo steady movin
Niggas who flippin new 98's is steady cruising
Bumpin up the block flossin for the chicks 'cause they rich
But I ain't leavin' off the front with the blunt
Set a switch just to pull in all the thickest btiches
At the crib I can't get caught wit heat
If it's some static I shall chalk and sweep
I go and get the B's up off but chief
""Come get me if the phone for me I'm at the party across the street""
I'm enjoying the breeze high degreez and no ease
Pockets be full of G's smoking B's hiding the fees
Making no enemies the po P's yellin' out ""Freeze""
Serving niggas wit ease staking cheese so nigga please
Tell me 'bout some ghetto love
Homies around smoking Newports till the brew drunk short
You can travel the world can't find a place like home

Flowin this style I be singin' and bringin'
It's breakin the people and go in the mind of a teen
Be makin' 'em hear it and manifest up in him that I'm a star to become
Quick the lyrical style I'ma kick
You better catch the rhythm of it
Cause hip-hop is becomin complicated, never be left hung
Bringin' a style like this kinda quick and crisp
A lyrical twist be comin' from Chi-Town
I know that hip-hoppers all over will be stung

Frum the tip of my tung (7X)

Frum among the tip of my tung
Rock the style of my second verse like that of my first
Be showin the hip-hop hypes my types of flowin, but not the best of T
From an imagination this was took, a mental crook
Stirring this up like a chef or cook
I hear them say give me the recipe
Breakin this off in the fashion of an erection of an adventurous style
That I'ma use to just confuse and smart people then go dumb
You say me style be wack cause y'all can't manifest what I be sayin'
Think I'm a lyrical midget, watch me then say fee-fi-fo-fum
Flowin this like a veteran that I'm incredible is what they be stung by
When I'ma give in a flow of the funk I erect like a wee-wee
Then see me gee, we be DJ Jihad and T.T.
Steppin and then I'ma find a lyrical line that'll flow from me like peepee
Rockin' and me stylin, rockin' and me stylin, wildin

Cause all women ain't lame
Matter fact the hoes pimp too
Ms. Kane will fuck around and pimp you
Coulda had control of her but they way you trick her she meant to

My fingers on frost, ears on froze
Hangin' at the club where hoes slide down the pole
Rolling with the Gs and the Foes and the Souls
With two bitches on my arms, sporting thousand dollar clothes
Looking kind of stunning, so the cameras on flick
Ain't no motherfuckers out here that can do it like this
On top of my game, and when a hater's all fall

Shake it for me bitch, let me see you get loose
Let me see you sipping on some shit that's 80 proof
Let me see if Imma let you get up in the 'lac
Bend over so I can see how Imma hit it from the back

And I'm clubbin' wit the pees, I get cheddar wit the fees
I'm always on the hustle, so don't ask why I succeed
I got flows, I got dro, I got whatever you need

And if I ever go broke, I'm guaranteed to bounce back
If beats was like a tipper, then my flow would play the cane
Got shit to make you float off the floor, like David Blaine
Get rich because I spit it universal to the drums
And I circle with some guns, blowin' purple out my lungs
I pimp and fuck a bitch, I don't need the battle-ax
I be on the move, staying paid pushing Cadillacs
Investing in my raps, if I don't make a quarter back
I throw eight balls to my homies on the corners like quarterbacks
Let me break your back shorty, show me what you got shorty
We some motherfuking killers, Chicago made niggaz making figures
(Verse Three)
Teeth on bling, rolly on flick
Standing on the stage while I'm holding on my dick
Bout to spit a new verse off out the mobstaz new shit
Holla walla pop the colla on my new outfit
If you want war, you think you got rounds to come get me
I think you better go smoke a whole pound of that sticky
Keep on talking doctrine of hate around your committee
Ima dodge that nigga that put it down for the city"

Here I am... ummm... here I am
Here I am... come and get me.
On a rainy dark day early morn,
A lethal legacy was born,
Ask any rapper around
'Bout the fuckin' mics I left torn
But they won't give me all my P's
And I won't leave the Chi to get G's
Got love for my MCs at home
But some of them still hate on me
Look how many years I done repped
Hustled through the streets and the Go
Inspired by the first rappers ever
Signed a contract a decade ago
Put Chi name on records in the East
Put Chi name on records in the West
Put Chi name on records in the South
B**** how you gone open yo mouth
To the mutha f***ers' industry
Why you hate on me and my city
Will it be an imbalance of power if y'all let Chi niggas get G's
Or is it us holdin' us back
Think hard when you rollin' yo sack
Whatever the case my Chi nigga
If it's in my means I got yo back
What the f***'s really going on
Does he bite 'cause he know he on
Don't he know I already established myself as Twista Coleone
Well I'm holdin' my city down
Ain't goin' nowhere here I stand
You know where I am
If you hate me (come and get me)
If you want me (come and get me)
Here I am
Here I am... ummm... here I am
Here I am... ummm... here I am
Here I am... ummm... here I am
Here I am... come and get me... come and get me
What did I do to deserve
All of this madness around me
Found me in the studio buryin' myself in work smokin' herb
Tried to kick me to the curb
To the back
To the ditch
To the dump
To the shack
But I sprint
In the front
In a Lac
With a fifth and a blunt
And I'm back
In the b**** wit a pump
And I'm ready to bust at you h**s
Ready to dump lames in ditches
Steady makin' fakers bleed
LB family handle business
Come and enter Twista's realm
Journey wit me through the pain
The hurt just might make you invision drama that can turn you insane
How much of my chaos bring tears
How many threaten my career
How many threatin' to murder me but b**** you know where I live
Who the f*** do you think I is
Y'all ain't comin' at no lil shawty
Why you think you can't hurt like these years
Joe why my lil P's got you soft
Think you finna' bring out my fears
Tell me why my success make you cry
And why my downfalls make you laugh
But I bet my hydro got you high
Never let hate back me down
Stand firm like a man
If you want me (come and get me)
Wanna kill me (come and get me)
Here I am
Here I am... ummm... here I am
Here I am... ummm... here I am
Here I am... ummm... here I am
Here I am... come and get me... come and get me
We got geo like Neo and of course we as sourcy as Morpheus
Or we as sick as Sir Marcus aralias, alias, atheist
Against niggas who flow be the achiest
Against the aliens and why they hate me is maybe it's 'cause I'm controlin' this radius
Of this world and this whole universe
Don't believe let me spit you a verse
Just when you thought you was worse
I come wit words that'll make you disperse
My allies know I'm too cold
My enemies know I spit fast
My lords know I bust that thang
My gangsta's know I'll whoop some ass
Mobster family steady ride
LB family steady click
When us and other crews collide
Choose ya weapon take a pick
Load up, click clack, it's on
Finna' bust, get back, run home
Come at me bogus get whacked... wit a strap... to the back... of the dome
Industry niggas get gone
Heard y'all be speakin' big words
I'll show you some s*** that'll a blow you down, slow you down, like you sip syrup
It's Chi sacrificial lamb
Right here I stand firm
If you hate (come and get me)
If you want me (come and get me)

You ever seen what a real nigga look like?
Sittin' in the Lamborghini lower than the black 'vette
With a pocket full of money lookin' for a honey
Stuntin and never trippin' on nothin' 'cause I got that
Exquisite taste, chase paper, capers on my résumé
And where I lay might get a little bit, lonely
On the grind, so I be missin' the feelin'
Of a woman touchin' me and layin' all up on me
But I see you got the make-up and the tendencies
A complete understandin' that a nigga gotta work
Even though she be havin' a attitude
I tell her ""You ain't gotta curse baby, I'ma buy the purse""
I feel like she a fly bitch
The only one I wanna see in fly kicks
And I want her to be mine so I spit her some game
From a nigga guaranteed to die rich

Deep inside sweet and sexy but you act tough

56,Got Away,2014,Dark Horse (2014),Midwest Rap,Twista,"Uh, uh
Where did she go, where did she go?
Security callin' me but I ain't ready to go
She pulled up to the telly in a Chrysler Concorde
Complimented her, told her she look nice in Tom Ford
Pulled out the six and told her let me get the digits
I'm giggin' in the city, come out tonight so we can kick it
Twista, 'mista-spit-it-fast', she can tell I do work
Only thing slow about me is the snail on my shirt
I don't even gotta wonder what a real woman is
When I look for the type, it is you
With her right on my side, on a mic, in a fight
For the night, then I might get with you
But now I'm leavin' the schemin' for any reason to stay
'Cause I feel like...
Fresh in the flesh, you a freshman at adolescence
Wanted to be with her but had to leave her 'cause you're a senior
High school sweetheart, can't believe you gon' be apart
Different colleges, why you gotta break my heart to get smart
Got 99 problems and this is definitely one
But somethin's stoppin' me from thinkin' our legacy is done
I feel our breakup's inappropriate, I want you and I meant it
We gon' figure somethin' out though our parents is against it
Say that I'm not gon' be successful, but I still won if it's stressful
Thinkin' about how I can't get that or you wonderin' if I left you
I ain't gon' be the one talkin' about I should've kept you
I ain't gon' be the one wonderin' how that shit affect you
Come up with a way to get you back
Workin' on the plot, plan
Method on my mind
She one of a kind
When I'm lookin' for the one to love
She the one I wanna find
So I gotta search
When we get back together, you gotta stay
My future, but for today
You're the one that got away..."

(Damn)
I think the club finna close man but I be the Twista
You know how I be doin' it with the slow jams
Take a look at the shawty chillin' by the door
Man, I'm really into her persona
'Cause she don't be takin' drama but she thick
When I ask her where she get
Then she say she get it from her momma
So I think I'ma pop champagne 'cause the glass tall
The bartender said it was the last call
I told her give it to me fast so we can slow dance
And I can put my hands on her ass
(Yes)
And she like it when I hold and grip control them hips
And you know I like it when she get low and dip
Plenty swagger when she move slow and sip
When they cut the lights on you gon' roll with The Twist
Lookin' so lovely in the fit, you got on
But it don't matter if you was in a dress or you in some jeans
Fragrance by Adidas, purse from another country
Look at you, girl, you doin' yo' thing
Everybody leavin' with somebody and I gotta get me somebody

On my way to the floor, baby, hold on to my shoulders
Girl, I won't let you fall, just hold on to my shoulders
She was lookin' nice, too hot for the carveya
She a melt the ice, lil' mamma kinda
Like Rihanna, she was livin' the life she be given advice
But just to have an orgasm she gotta get a device
What's that for? Is ya man, a boy?
'Cause he don't know how to give you what you here for
I think I gotta show you what the pilot get for
And the question is what I whisper in ya ear for
You nasty, love be on top, mad if I pop
If you miss the drop, you nasty, how you made me choke
You told me I can put it anywhere I want to
Sex so good she do it with no hands
I met you while the DJ was playin' the slow jam
As soon as we got into it into my slow dance
It's the beginnin' is when I was feelin' the romance
Now I be Twista with the super tight flow one might go
That's so cute, I gotta get me one before the night go
I tell the maestro that's yo' cue
Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one

Put 'em in the hot seat grab a hoe
I'll show you some shit that'll make your eyes explode out ya skull
Cause bein odd ont the block is a N-O
Niggas didn't know that I could go off, and show off, and throw off the law

Boy you can't mess wit a mad and hard head
Fool, I'm a straight low neva broke
Cause today I be a balla, shot shot caller
I don't give a fuck about one
Them hoes ain't even got love and they boo-hooin

Big T and I'm from Chicago
You know I gotta represent the city doe
A nigga fin' to shoot a new video
So I'm fin' to take a trip out to Cali yo

Hit the West coast, now I'm fuckin' with Snoop
Told a few hoes to come up to the shoot
And she was lookin' so cold pullin up in the Coupe
Pretty skin tone, a nigga got y'all
Soon as I took a look at them big brown eyes
Fat ass, my dick got hard
Soon as I took a look at the big brown thighs
Too sassy, bet you doin' nasty
And I can tell it when I'm lookin' at the way you walk
Thick lips, ready for suckin
And a nigga wanna fuck you when I listen to the way you talk
I'ma do it like this when I drop at you
Let you know that I'm the Twist' when I pop at you
Comin' at you in the Mission Impossible
Let's go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles
Then as soon as we leave we gon' have to go and get naughty

And if you got me, then I got you
I'm a player, youse a player
We some players, so we should play a
Game, do yo' thang
Ain't it mayne, turn the lights off
Hit the right spot (ooh)
Make me feel how I wanna feel
But it can't happen if you ain't real
Don't, you, play with me
Come and spend, the day with me
Everything is everything
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the dopest of 'em all
Gots to be Big Snoop Dogg
So pick up the phone and answer my call

How, long, has it been
Since you had that thang up in
They say Dogg you walk it too much

Really 'cause, I miss that bitch

Shorty tell me how you get that thick
Where the fuck did you get that fit
Come and fire the 'dro up let me hit that shit

Forever guide my guys to a better mindstate or phase
To replace all the wicked ideas erased
All the fears about the payroll
What you say Lo about Sko
We representin' the Chi, do or die for real
Niggaz caps gettin' twist off they tops for real
The conflict's in the hearts of many men for real
The convicts in the Pen holdin' plenty steel
Niggaz know they house bigger but they play in the field
Tabasco ain't gon' let it ride though
Let my brother fat folk
I thrill for the kill
Smoke me a?
Never runnin' from the mill boy I'm runnin' the field
It's the eternal Lord feel cemeteries revealed
Prophecies prophetcized stuff bein' fulfilled
And to another man I'll never kneel
Until I see Allah, fate's comin' from the wheel
And baby girl, you can check it you can dig it here
If yo nigga try to test it, you can bet it he'll

In the grave he lay, he lay, he lay

Quick to shoot a muthafucka down if he choke
Never see me in yo city broke
In the club spendin' 50 notes
Leave with 50 girls and 50 Folks
And we all tote scopes
Guarded like the Pope 'cause we got that bomb on the dope
G-stacks in our coat
Niggaz ask, we ain't hoes
Just to afloat with me, I'm livin' lovely
Baby come on and relax with a Folk
All my mackateers know why we ride down
Cliqued-up pick the bitch up bumpin' sounds, hurtin' the whole town
With raw pound all around me ya dig, the sounds off like a live round
22's on Fleet, peep my shine now
I got a whole fuckin' nation that'll ride out
And put yo lights out in a matter of minutes young nigga
So it's best for you to be closin' yo fuckin' mouth
Before I pull out and bust slugs in yo ass
You lucky yo bitch here, that's why I'm givin' you a pass
Nigga haul ass before I up and blast with no mask
And blow off you bit of mustache with yo tough ass
Shit everybody's bustin' down
My niggaz fallin' off all around
Before I go, I got my 50-rounds
To blaze a nigga before I hit the ground
He lay

It's really gettin' hot on the block
Niggaz got they glocks, niggaz sellin' they rocks
But my mind prepared to get this muthafuckin' knot
So a nigga ain't scared to put a nigga in the box
If I gotta drop him down in the grave
In the grave he gon' lay-he
Cause this shit don't stop, I shut 'me down everyday
Everyday anyway he, anyway he
If he grown or not, wrong or not
Niggaz better shake the spot and praise Allah
Don't let me see yo face nowhere by the peace Allah
A laundry mat, niggaz better have they glocks cocked off
Ready to blast off and get yo ass popped off
With 10 hot ones when I draw from ?? when I smash off over there
It's blood on the curb over there
And them niggaz that be actin' like nerds over there
And my niggaz that be flippin' plenty birds over there
For them niggaz that be gettin' on my nerves over there
For my brothers that be gettin' plenty dirt over there
For them ?? broads with all that weave in they hair
Who ain't got no walls, pussy like bees in the air
She dropped them draws and then I zoomed outta there
'Cause I got my laws, I'ma stay strong to myself
And I thought about y'all, that's why I ball by myself
I don't need no mob to make me feel like myself
I don't need no job, I'll make these G's by myself

Shit, I'm coming with the pistol, when I gotta kill 'em up
Apocalyptic imma get 'em, when I hit 'em up
Fill his body up wit holes, and the terror that will follow
Will have a nigga hit the deck, when I send it up
Put the pipe to your dome, I don't give a fuck about right from wrong
I get in the club, a nigga be feeling so bold
But if a nigga talk shit, I'll go right for the chrome
Then when you come back, come and see me do it worse
I'ma shoot the vehicle up put your body in a hearse
Bring you back alive like the bullets was a curse
Making the drive or put the ride in reverse
Don't wanna die again better get up in the wind

Jack a nigga for the dame of dames and I'll yack 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em,
Get a weapon and I crack his brain 'cause I'm a hustler, baller, pro,
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters and crawlers and hoes,
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm'a lift 'em up off a they toes,

We can get into it if you wanna do it, I'm leakin' the fluids outta the bodies that wanna come at this,
Empty out all kinds of blood for fuckin' wit' thugs, that I bury, my adversaries better want none of Twist,

And I done came a long way from lettin' me hold somethin' to roll somethin',
Found a victim 'n' him wit' venom input some adrenaline, and then kill 'em and send him to the cemetery,
Wit' a flow full of horror like a poltergiest, he called to Christ, when he saw how many men I buried,
(Shit...) And when it come to cheefin' good, nigga who that? Do that, I got the sack open,
And the herb got the flow so strong that I might crack the track, while back-to-back smokin',
Never come up when the mobs elite, nigga you ain't untouchable not when I spark the heat,
Comin' at you like sharks to meat, the blood start to leak,
I can tell when a mark's heart is weak, come at me fully loaded 'cause I'm hard to beat,

Finna spit it to 'em hard
Get your dame
Put her on the boulevard
Now I got er in training with my bottom bitch
She can learn a lot a shit
Like how to get it on a stroll
Be in control and shit on the other hoes
And be able to get fetti fo daddy from a lot a tricks
But the thump bumpin speakers in the trunk
Cause a nigga have to cop a little some some
Leavin' niggas bodies slump when I let the thump a dump
If I ever catch you fukin with the bump bump
Like a diamond I'm flawless
Ain't no fucking with rawest
When you enter my vicinity better be cautious
If you into makin' money step into my office
Makin' hoes close shop
My flow came got the block hot
Took the tens got me super through the city in the drop top
Screamin out I just don't give a fuck
I'm the chief in the booth from when you see me coming through with the crew
Make you do what to do

For the chi till I die cause there's just no givin' up.
I'm holdin' down the game
What would you be hatin' for
I'm a playa from the go with the shit that you've been waitin for
I'm holdin' down the game

You can make a buck the momma
Niggas out here like to fuck the momma
(Verse Two)
Take a look at my japer

And on the block smokin' weed with hash when I breeze pass

66,Hope,2004,Kamikaze (2004),Midwest Rap,Twista,"Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left-Eye
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers
And everybody lost period
All we got is hope
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, and I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I won't have to travel six hours to see him in jail, and I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, and I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, and I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, and I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi, and I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, and I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, but uh
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward, 'cause we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on, let's hope
'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful, and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but, that's okay
Let's be hopeful
I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring, shit
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, and I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, and I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, you feel me (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, ya dig
I hope them mothers stain' strong
You can make it whether you wit him or your mans gone, and I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on them priest like they did R. Kelly, and I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, shit (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish that enemies could talk
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game, let's hope
'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful, and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but, that's okay
Let's be hopeful
Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always so optimistic
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get 'em on
And in the famous words of Mr. King ""Why can't we all just get along?""
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, and I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, and I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfillin' these downfalls and prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church and let's hope
'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful, and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but, that's okay
'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful, and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but, that's okay

The Bible says ""Ye shall prosper""
I am such a Mobsta
The Bible says ""Ye shall prosper""
So come and bow down to royalty
Kiss both of my cheeks to show loyalty
The flow is ceremonial, the style of rituals so be cordial
And please act accordingly
This ain't a legend or folklore
Chi-raq violence is real, not a Cold War
But in the streets call it coke wars
And do not open your mouth unless you spoke for
Please Father forgive me
I had to give him two to the kidney
Didn't know that I was nice
Any night I perform like Rice - Jerry, Sydney
Ray too, hangin' out with Windy City gratefuls
In the back of the club we play pool
Only real niggas 'cause they cool
And who did bids and didn't snitch and stayed true
But now-a-days family come first
Shorties out here is gettin' killed over turf
Well if the meek shall inherit the earth
Tell me why I gotta know what a hundred bricks is worth?
...Ah, flow so gorgeous
The coldest to ever touch a cordless
I'm on the streets Forbes List
And with the rhymes I'm divine like Osiris, Horus
It's a clash of the titans
Warriors on the street blastin and fightin'
Seen it all, been a part of it all
Don't get it twisted if I'm on a different path when I'm writin
I am such a Mobsta
The Bible says ""Ye shall prosper""
I am such a Mobsta
The Bible says ""Ye shall prosper""
Blowin' loud by the quarter
Conversations about what's up with a porter
We can sit down at the table, but first
You gotta kiss the pinky ring, it's according to the order
My niggas show me how much to cut it with
And what to do when the kitchen was the workplace
Bring the pot over the stove to a boil
Comin' out the crib smellin like burnt paste
As the Lord is my witness
I done seen so many end up on the hitlist
Shootin the car till it slow down
And now I see nothin' but lifeless, stiffness, hit this
Three-eighty in the headset
Bricks in the dashboard and the door panels
Give me the ball nigga, hand check
Niggas can't ball 'cause they got poor handles
So with a wave of the hand
I'ma gain green if I offer them work
Create a chain of command
Don't try to talk to me unless you talk to him first
...In God we trust
And it ain't another Mob like us
Pocket full of eightballs on the bus
To undercovers I say what's up in the truck
Whole team full of bravado
Gettin' money since niggas that wore Movado
Rollin' in a Cadillac El Dorado
Bubble Lexus or the all-black Tahoe

Hey love, what's up, come give me a kiss
Have you ever seen a po pimp with eyes as pretty as this
And still be the rawest, spittin' flawless game while I get my G's
I hit my B's, pullin' up on fees I bet I get piece
'Cause I'm impressin', lovin', when I'm kissin' and huggin'
All into good rushin', touchin', better roll when I flush 'em
I'm causin' concussion, sportin' pellet, come here baby
My way will change, I used to kinda rugged my day
Let's dance, while we get our groove on I get known
If it's on, then Lexus she gon' get home
First get bucked up and sip on
G on the room and drink po wine up in the whirlpool
Don't leave my comb and pearl too
Leavin', let the girl cool my world, ooh

Pull my mink over your shoulders when we leave out the club
Ain't no need to knock a con, I'm feelin' like Chaka Kahn
She the bomb like Lebanon, still fine with no Revlon
Just let the Don inside, I promise pleasure and sweat
I guarantee you ain't gon' be no regrets

Girl you better be on script on who you with
She's been forcin' Liffy Stokes from the mobsta click

I'm chillin' at the click, with nums getting numb, I bumps
Tryin' to find a cutie to kickin' with, watch the risin' sun
Here she comes with them big legs, no fat on the back
What's up shorty, can we kick it tonight and choke on the sack
Come see as I foreplay, freaky at this slow-ass track
Big and black, had attention ready to dig in that
So what we just met, that don't mean I won't give you respect
I just fight the temptation to get your body real wet

'Cause on the way up to my condo, your ears pop
When I hit the lock I'm a villain, the mobstas make the killin'
As we lay on my waterbed with the mirrors on the ceiling
The wall too, got friends that's all true, I call Cru
Tryin' to fall too, I got tall brew, it's all you
Or like I be, let's shoot up to the club, like two tattoos
VIP, who gets who, no dancing with two left shoes
Do that fool, do that, do that, who that creeps on my hood
Do I see my nigs thuggin' but, dawg, y'all lookin' good
Ballers please, it's a straight playas party, can't fuck with these
Champagne and Henessies for my G's and stuck a piece, and uh
Haters please, no bustin' we up in place
Put 'em in the trunk, the flame
When I'm tryin' to get up with ""what's her name""
The precious tonight I met, let's ride, I feel this like a set
While you're dancing, I'ma kiss off the sweat

77,It Feels So Good,1997,Adrenaline Rush (1997),Midwest Rap,Twista,"(INTRO) This goes out to all riders worldwide
Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
Where playa hatin' killers and the hood niggaz thrive
And lame motherfuckers can barely survive
One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch
Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh
Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit
The high discover me, hit the front porch
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home 'cause one of them
Got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where y'all goin' y'all thick as hell
What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin' too much though
We just ridin' around bumpin sounds trippin' out while we flame janes
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang
And slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing
Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit
Speedpass the clit and get passionate
Grab the buckle and unfasten it
And we can get into some ol' nasty shit
Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus
This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie
Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by
But hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high
Cause it feels so good
It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin' high)
Rollin' through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin' with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin' high)
Rollin' through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin' with nowhere to go
Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up
When niggas we lust smokin' some but the flame tight
Trippin' off how we survivin the rugged terrain
And try to hang tight getting fucked up on gang night
Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the scrap
Even we sent Deebo back to back to back
We still be holdin' stacks of packs
Rollin' through wit black blacks, blunt reds, ash trays, and crack sacks
Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on
Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on
If ain't no strokin we strollin along
Rollin' the chrome out really trippin'
Because we take the smoke to the dome
Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones
Glisten from all the sunlight
Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight
Booty hung right and every night we see at least one fight
Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques
Now together we mush
But when are we strapped through and rug cutters
Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers
Ridin' every one of y'all my muhfuckers
So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome
We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown
Hopin to get my thang on
Not matter what block you stay on kick it
Round the world it's the same song
(So the Mobsters just flame on)
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood
Now we got up on hittin the 'cause
From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves
Mo' we got up on some bud
Straight hittin' up the block searching for love
Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone
Smokin' delight the body right what the party like
Are you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky
But only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high
Cause it feels so good
Sittin' back cruising through the slow breeze
Thinkin' how can I get mo' cheese
Bumpin a system costin 4 G's
I stay on my P's for the po-P's
Split the Phillie with my door keys
Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through
Sit on the floor playin' Tekken 2
Lesson two I'm adressin you
Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew
Bring out the best in you
Confessin true lies about your inner thighs
And where they been hopin maybe you be my lady
What's the potatoes without the gravy
What you feelin' on maybe soft with the silicone baby
But can you pay me?
Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll
While rockin' dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop
We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about
How later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks
Now is that news or not?
Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O""
Get a ""B"" and split it now watch me kill it
Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro
On billets take a choke on so I can really feel it
Thinkin' about not having the rich life
But the hood life was still a good life
And that we know always and forever though
For ever more rollin' in the ghetto with nowhere to go
And it feels so good"

Let me get straight to it
Her body like a Bugatti, ain't nothing like a Buick
When we get passionate I'm in love with how you do it
No longer want to lease it, I want the title to it
I might have blew it but now I know I want to own it
And get rid of opponents but I know fame can be blind
Never knew nothing like it is so one of a kind
I know that it'll be stupid to not claim that it's mine
She fit me like a glove, hop up right on top of her man
And with no hands she give me a hug
Go ahead and reverse it baby you pop it like a drug
Asking me how I feel when I'm inside your love
Better than the mall
In other words whenever I'm up in your hall
I feel the ripples on the wall
A spectacular feeling when I get up in them draws
And with no hands she can even give an applause
Cause you got me gone, all I can say is ""True that""
Whenever I put the soap hole inside you at
Snug, but you can see it's something you ain't new at
Ooh, I can feel it when you do that
I can feel it when you do that, she got a nigga stuck
Murder with the pussy now you just been cut
She got the kush in her bush and I'mma take a puff
Telling me that it's yours and I can't get enough
And she talkin' like

Tell me that it's the one
Tell me baby it's the one you been waiting for
Tell me so I can make sure
Tell me baby 'cause you know that it's yours
Oh-whoa
You know that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, baby
You know that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, that it's yours, baby

She got a body like a Maserati
And she got the owochi cochi like a 'Rochi
Ass fuck her in the back of the Kawasaki
But the flow is a classic so it's probably a Harley
Hotty be better than any thot around here
I see you [?] that I can be your manager
My place so let me show you I can handle ya
Scarface, I fuck you right over the banister
And it's the way that you be telling me that its yours baby
How I'm a breath of fresh air, you been so bored lately
And how you like to be reassured by me telling you that you the one
And how it be mine and how I'm going crazy
You got a nigga caught up in it, every time I'm all up in it
Loving every minute, all I know is I don't wanna finish
And I'mma be talking to you while I hit it when you ask me to

Tell me baby it's the one you been waiting for
Tell me so I can make sure

Thank you
Hello
(Turtle Banxx)
Hey sis let me speak to momma
Who me on find besides all the drama
The system took me in but then they took me under
I suffer being another number
I wonder if I could conquer dis criminal structure built to puncture
The hearts of men
When them guards come in the bars and the pen
I know I'm in hell and its hard to win
I stay up late lying in the dark for me
Thinking 'bout the night the police came marching in
It's like they wouldn't stop barging in
Asking momma what mob I'm in
Try strictly left us some scars within
Fighting back the lyrics of a favorite baptist him
It's over now can't hold a child
Mold a child scold a child or own a child a soldier now
Baby hold your tears
Become a teacher mold ya peers
Let 'em know its cold in here
This ain't the way to spend them older years
I'm over the fears of the world
No longer momma's pearl in here
It's all clear them older cats school me to the game
I'm all ears no mo rats or any cold beers
The ghetto famous disappear
They run up in my home
And took you from my world
Now ya gone and I'm feeling all the pain that your going through
(Chorus 1 in background of chorus 2)
Sometimes I lay back in my cell crying
Hells blind but I hope I make it through this jail time
Trying to stay focus but I heard they mad me panic before
I guess that's what I got my family for behind bars
(Turtle Banxx)
I'm running outta time
Momma there yet
Where my little brother let me holla at him
What's up cat
I got you covered
Stay in the books them streets is a motha
Undercovers posing as hustlers exposing the brothers controlling the
Struggle by any means
Brutality got the police running like the enemy
Our community need more hugs instead of the slugs the guns the drugs
Got crime on killing the love the spirits above
Drop a warning sigh its only 1999
But all I think about is 85 them good times
Momma give us her last dime
Icey cups you drop yours I give you mine
True love define us to divine
Calling it on another's pride but I hate to see you cry
The rain come shine
My family feel my pain inside
By the way my baby momma getting married
Brought tears to my eyes I just hope my son happy
(Chorus 1 in background of chorus 2)
(Turtle Banxx)
Ran to the phone got a hundred guys like me
And all we have is precious minutes to reach our people our free
Brother listen be strong for momma
Let her know I never meant to cause her no drama
The pain make my vain cries thunder
Will I recover my name and still discover how the game become us
Look how they done us
Watered down our pride and drunkers riders g's and hustlers
We gotta guide our younger there's better days among us
Never let the rage you under upstage the promise till tomorrow
And the C's just follow wont feel the sorrow
For the misery we wallowing time swallowing
Them better days in this gaze got my mind boggling
Oh momma and hey lady I miss you
And them ways you raised me them hard head things that drove you crazy
Realize ya son took a lot of heart from ya
Its phone check time I'm gone momma I love you

Most of you motherfuckers is comical
The rule like me is impossible
Verbally illogical I took the heat and then followed you to your residence
And spread your molecules blood floods your follicles
Damn right we don't acknowledge you
The streets got eyes of leopard for telling niggas to up weaponry
When they see your ass blast and feed your ass to the fish
Life's a bitch that'll suck ya dick
And tell them guys we hit that cash
Kick ass nigga they coming for the whole pie
Old time guys that wont be satisfied till you lay in a grave
Wont be satisfied till the location of the safe cave
Some were shining too much so I hide in the shade
The minute you made this move gave him one to his brain
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
In every video its
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
In every studio its
Kill kill kill murder murder murder

Guns that don't reach shit in a talk of insanity

I bury ya slug in them haters claiming they veins pump up
Burying blood turns out y'all the scariest thug

Controversy wild niggas that's thirsty and bodily fluids
Smoking terror that'll smell bloody hands on your soul like mascara
Disciples of death
You wont even hear fears in they cry
Don't you hear that cold in they throat and see they tears in they eyes

Deaths coming closer as you let kamikazi
Enter yo body careful or you die standin vertical
And anyone that opposes I swear to God I'mma get you
Even if I gotta murder me to murder you"
82,Korrupt World,1997,Adrenaline Rush (1997),Midwest Rap,Twista,"Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up,
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood spilling
Poppin' lip and taking over his tip is why he had to kill him
Now his bodies in chalk and no longer can talk so then a life is lost
Somebody tricked off and the killer was caught
So now his lifes his cost
You might get caught
So to make a move these motherfuckers is petrified
All the best that tried won't even slide
So just bless the rest that died
Is it a test of pride when inside
You grip a trigger but you didn't wanna pull it
Could it be a motherfucker that you notice
On the other side of the bullet
Should it matter now you figure fuck it I'ma waste him
It's just a murda for the nation
But some end up locked up, broke up
For felonies and over overly motherly abrasion
Now in front of me encased in a coffin is a body
With people around sad and froze
Teardrops and rain
But folks didn't really feel the pain until the casket closed
I was drastic chose and the mother threw a frown
Even though the gunner was found
Cause it seems like yesterday when he was running around
Now he under the ground 'cause they gonna get down in these streets Even
Though you pack a piece for heat these niggaz urgin' to bust
The game ain't the same so stay away from the curb
If you out there serving em' up and
Hook (repeat)
W/ ""make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt""
Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood pouring
Tragedy mess a man look in the mirror then I see the stud mourning
As these streets erases others it encase a brother
You had enough heart to waste this brother
But could you face his mother I was faced with other
Type of problems that had held me back
Couldn't tell me jack now I'm gone in my own zone
You ain't gotta tell me that so me trail me back to a time
When a motherfucker'd lost his will survive
Me and my folks had to hustle and steal for a meal
Eat or had to kill to survive
I remember when you had my back
When the relative passed and my momma cried
When the house caught flames
You collapsed in my arms when you heard that father d' died
I take drama in stride
Even though I had to go through a thing to get myself together
Still suffer but the worst is gone
So it's on till the roamin' man have his shelter
But if I end up back on the streets again and I had to receive my fate Smoke
Weed at the wake so the pain and hate escapes
To keep the kids straight
Cause you did straight if your seed proceed
As long as they keep learning and keep growing up
Right now we survive in a place that's full of doubt
And about to self-destruct
Visualize in invisible eyes how I individualize
Critical cries of pitiful skies that rain pain upon the ghetto land
Where the unforgettable dies
Subliminal lies mean a motherfucker never gone make it
If he don't peep it and keep it in check soon
Womb to the tomb death is in the next room
If a nigga ain't realizin' a k's and tech's doom
Let's assume another brother wanna laugh at you
I think he just took a blast at you
You won't have it you killed him
There go the trigger try to kick it but his niggas coming after you Telling
You a stranger must be crazy
To step it to a motherfucker that's dangerous
'Cause it's a gang of us throwin' knuckles in the scuffle
If we have two things of bust
It's cocaine to us and my brains to dust
I represent you up there so I try
Long as I leave my enemy bust vicinity crushed
I don't really give a fuck if I die
So why lie my people should be glad to survive in the land of the lost It's a
Plan of the boss leaving motherfuckers dying
With their grandmother's hand on the cross
So I take a stand when I talk ran instead of walked
To chalk another victory
How you did the caper hid the paper
Breaking other niggas off is a mystery
With the chemicals and drugs all of these criminals and thugs
Just keep comin' up better watch yourself ain't no love in the streets In a
Ghetto of a world that's corrupt"

(Chorus: Twista + (Pharrell))
You, you, you want the lavish crib and fancy cars
You want the face, on that Rolex shinin like the stars
Don't worry mayne, you could get it mayne
(If you look in the sky and you don't see your dream)
(Man don't feel defeated, cause trust me you can build it)
(Twista)
Now hear the words that I flow when I spit
I know shorties that be havin' dreams of goin' legit
But the hustle quicker so they cop a fo' on the split
Now they got enough money where they can go get a brick
It's on - ain't nuttin gon' stop us now
Gotta look at 24's while they watch us now
Spinners rollin' up the block while they pump out noise
But they always get into it with the jump out boys
And why? Take a look at all the people that got dubs
You ain't legitimate, you out here servin' them rocks up
I know you want the radio and screens to pop up
But we gotta get the money and try not to get locked up
Know the difference between real and fake
Different work is just like different real estate
Open your mind, you got more than the skill to take
'Cause I know
(Pharrell)
Uh, one time for my niggaz on the corner
With the burners on and with the fresh yams in they tube socks
Uh, two times for my niggaz with they hands in the air
Sayin' a prayer cause the game left their dude shot
Yes - I know that puzzle
Niggaz at each other thinkin' they will bust you
The bang is the same even if it's muffled
But the moment so loud when a dead man hug you
He's cold in your arms, but you ain't gon' be foldin your arms
You gon' be lowered in your arms
Cryin to open the jar, and to add injury to insult
You're smokin' your life away
Look at me, big car big house big jewels
All that came out my backpack
You ain't gon' do it, it ain't gon' work, you ain't gon' prove it
Even though that hurt, I just skated past that
Look - everybody got dreams about ki's
Chains full of ice with S after the V's
Horse on the hood, a grill full with the B's
Dangling your feet in San Turin-y breeze
Make a virtual picture, and spin around
That ain't it, well fuck it nigga we get it down
Never try to grab your ankle nigga we'll kick 'em down
Focus up, we gotta hit it now
Bruh when your cell goes clink, that's when you forfeit
All them dreams, all that divorce it
You ain't even get to see new mansion and Porsche shit
This dedicated to my man up in Norfolk, locked up
Ha ha... wait (repeat 2X)
My nigga open yo' mind, mind
Aren't you ready to go?
All of my fears inside, side
Let 'em blow like 'dro
(Twista)
Through the wisdom of a prism I see I don't wanna go to prison
I make the decision to get liver
Reminiscin as I take a listen to my nigga 'Pac
While I envision my ""Ambitions Az a Ridah""
Listen to Pharrell spit to the track
Pull up in a burgundy Bentley with a bitch in the back
I get to the paper like a hyper get to the crack
I ain't speculatin homey I just stick to the facts, c'mon
If you wanna get the money and the status and the mob
Better ride when you roll with the crew
Take a listen for the bub hit the bud
When you hear this in the club then you know what to do
Look at the vision of a mack spittin' crack on the track
Throw these stacks in the black Cadillac
Get it like Twista and Neptunes, I got your back
And know you
Ha ha... wait (repeat 2X)
My nigga open yo' mind, mind
Aren't you ready to go?
All of my fears inside, side
Let 'em blow like 'dro

Faggots, smelling at me looking happy, don't make me
Take your sweet sixteen and turn the ants into a sugar daddy
You need a quilt to carry like I need a bitch to marry
I pilt on, live off your ants to the cemetery
Busting my thang, and I ain't able, right at your chest
Where your chain dangle, see what the game bring you
A desert eagle thrashing, ski masking
Duck tape, a tuxedo and casket, I studied the bastard
Know where he eats, shits, sleeps shit, how you think
He stay low key 'cause he fucked with that ?arlese? bitch
But about these ships squeeze clips until they empty
Continue to act up, I clack up my back up city
My folks'll make you high stealth like ivy camoes
I only fuck with top show hoes, that wave on gold
And full of the rooms getting head in the rooms
Kicked 'em out and kicked it off with my folks?
(Chorus: Twista)
We about dissing you bitches, we about busting you hoes
We about serving you haters like we was serving the golds
Y'all can't fuck with these Ballaz, y'all can't hang with my city

Beam keep shit hot 'case y'all don't know
When you argue with your bitch she stay punking you out
She on the phone telling dude what you got in your house
Put that bitch on your mattress how you carry that hoe
Keep it real with her dog you bout to marry that hoe
Them nine O's that you copping yeah that's fin to get hit
Tell your bitch stop bitching off me giving me shit
When you see her popping her at other niggas you quick to frown
Nigga don't save her, let the bitch bust down
Except you, I'm in the projects, busting them thangs
Why you be that greasy ass fool shooting at the gun range
Your melon just like a banana, too easy to peel
Want a competition in this bitch y'all too easy to kill

Rush for the 9-8, mobsta elites
Ain't it a shame how we make ballin' look so sweet
Especially when you ain't gotta hide your shit
You know what I'm sayin', you can just ball for free
Campaignin' your nation, in a legit demonstration
And gotta face incarceration
Eh yo, Liffy Stokes, let 'em know what's happenin'
(Liffy Stokes)
A nigga been hustlin' so long, God knows I've done so much wrong
I was 16 grown and holdin' chrome, servin' blows, we in' zones
My mom didn't understand me ""Boy, you gon' die just like your daddy
From two to the head, dumped in the riverbed
I didn't to hurt you so badly,"" I was young and dumb
Fast life sprung of the money and hoes that it brung
Had a clip full of hollows to bring your momma sorrow
But now regret what I've done
Drama's all in the game whether gang bang or slang
I had to do my thang
When the shots rang, that's when it clicks in my brain
All the shit's the same
My nigga need a change, I had to get off out these streets
To get you out your seat
Flip a Trax beat, hit the crib and puff on a sweet
And let 'em feel something deep
Deep so the realest can feel
How I felt right before I bust that steel
Rappin' 'bout my life of skrill
And the everyday struggles of a nigga in the chill
Come on and take a little trip with a legit balla
Chi shot-callers (Shot up the chrome and let's swang)
Taggers wettin' up the walls.
(Some bitches in the back and a pocket full of scratch
Take a match and spark up a little bud and get blown away)
(Mayz)
This shit I've been tokin' is potent
Got me straight thinkin' about takin' Mary Jane and eloping
Blowin' smoke with the sunroof half-way opened
Countercode with the scope in close range
I guess he gotta aim, and stick a few thangs in the nigga's brain
No face straps (?) thinkin' that he can
Puttin' food on table is an everyday strain
But now I did finally flip my shit legit
And workin' a different angle of the game
Even though my hussle ain't changed
I'm still prayin' my best presence to overcome my pain
Singin' tapes of cain
The roads to riches seems longer than the freight train
And every little stop keep a nigga tryin' to plot
On the paper you done gain until you drain
But I put that on the foe
I'ma flow till I got no choice, or better yet no voice
But still by that time I hope to write enough rhymes
To own a fleet real estate with a Rolce Royce
Rollin' deep through this Chi-Town streets
With my mobsta elites on the way to North Riverside Mall
Givin' thanks to the all for givin' me a legit where to ball at
Keepin' shit tight for y'all
(Twista)
On the bus in disgust with an 
 full of rocks in my pocket
Nickel sacks in the other
For po-pos who watch, can't stop, it's hot
But I gotta make a profit for my baby and my mother
Straight up hustler
What's the mental frame of mind
A nigga had to have the role
Be sold, or be poor up in these city streets
Or with the pistol playin' Mr. Repo
Fuck Deebo, I explode like C-4 so give me 50 feet
Bustin' shots in every direction
A nigga stoppin' my money from getting made
I done witnessed public aid, people get sprayed, the tip raise
And momma cry, ""my bills can't get paid""
If I have to I'ma send cheese from blows
Nobody can hurt me I run with thugsta greed, GD's and foes
Workin' the spot 'cause we need some clothes
Who'd ever thought I'd be making money off of my CD's and shows
My crib got gats in the hall, rats steady crawl
Roaches comin' out the cracks in the wall
On the tip, bustin' with my back to the wall
Work my way up to an ounce, now I'm back to a 'ball
Now I'm spendin' stacks at the mall
Bendin' blocks on barbers hopin' my profits stack a bit taller
Twista AKA ""The Bitch Caller"", bringin' money to the mob
Just to be a pimp-shit talker

When pimpin' step up in tha house put yo bitch up,
I got a Remi bottle instead of a pimp cup,
It shine like a summer day wit' my wrist up,
She wanna wave now 'cause my nigga Twista,
Dissed her then bounced wit' her sister,
I tell her keep her head down and her hips up,
You can keep the pussy I'ma tear them pretty lips up,
Let that ass roll like 24's on a big truck,
And ya g-string let it bounce when tha beat bang,
Make it drop like them cars in tha g-thang,
Pull up ya skirt, work it like tha hood keep sayin'...
(Liffy Stokes)
Come on shorty make that ass pop, drop it like a rag-top,
Shake it like its bomb dro, stir it up like ready roc,
I gotta pocket full of tens and dubs...
I'm up in tha club, drunk as fuck, stuck, lookin' for love,
They lookin' for thugs... And I got to admit, guys we trust,
A lil' game, a lil' fame, I'll have 'em piling in the church bus,
Pumping on bomb dro, straight up to tha condo,
Open tha bus doors, head up to tha twelfth floor,
It's 'bout to crack now, layin' on my back now,
She shook one cheek at a time, then dropped it back down,
I'm goin' through a thang, I never knew tha name,
All I know is when she got low, A nigga lost it man...
(Outro: Twista)
You got my thang on swole... (Back that ass up)
Girl, you got my thang on swole... (Now make that ass drop)
You got my thang on swole... (Make that ass bounce)
Girl, you got my thang on swole... (Now make that ass drop)
Drop somethin', shake somethin'...
Work somethin', twork somethin'...
Break somethin', shake somethin'...
Work somethin', twork somethin'...
Break it, shake it, work it, twork it,
Break it, shake it, work it, twork it,
Break it, shake it, work it, twork it,
Break it, shake it, work it, twork it,
Break it, shake it, work it, twork it,
Shorty let me see you make tha left side move... (Side move)
Now let me see you make tha right side move... (Side move)
Now let me see you make both sides move... (Sides move)

Kells and Twist
Girl there ain't no other way to describe you
Your Momma raised you right
Yeah I like that
Chorus (R. Kelly)
It's like I'm sitting here in my rehab
I'm so crazy about you dear
Doctor of my soul
I won't never check out of here
Filled my prescription when I came to you and needed peace
You took me in and gave me joy and girl now I'm free
You in my circle when I needed to talk you had my back
You're my homey we go back thank you for that love rehab
Verse 1 (Twista)
You were back had nobody in my life
I'm a killer nigga or somebody gonna murder me soon
I'm a hope fiend I need a woman in my life
Could you take me to the emergency room
I need somebody that can nurse me back to health
'Cause I'm out here love sick shaking like Hoopdy
You took me up out of the Hoopdy
Put me in the Lex 300 that got me blowing on goopdy
Now why do I respect you
'Cause she down for a nigga before I was on the city in the city now she got me screaming out yes sir
Like a Pretty Ricky looking freaky, freaky while I'm smoking on the sticky hickey
When I'm down and I
You be rubbing my back because I miss you
You know I got issues
When I'm riding dirty and I got the thumper
And law pull me over you hold my pistol
Sick of how the women holding me
Telling me if I'm a see love by the way I want to hit you
You like it better when I'm not in cements because you better than Excedrin
Fellas in the hood ain't gonna get you
Hook (Twista)
I thought I knew what real love was tell I met you
I'm reminiscing on the love we had
I'm a stay sick for ever hope I never get well cause you got me in a love rehab
Verse 2 (R. Kelly)
So many problems so many peoples
So many decisions so many roads
That I have to choose
But still I roll the dice and pray that I don't lose
There where times I got weak and surely couldn't go on
And she came through
So many friends so many liars
And so many haters
Sometimes I just don't know who to trust
But yet still I turn the wheel of life and try my luck
There was a time when I was broke and didn't have a job
And this woman she showed me love
Since we first met I've been rising like an escalator
Now five years later We've come up like an elevator
You make me better babe
When I thought I was going crazy
I was just about to lose my mind
And you put me in your love rehab
Verse 3 (Twista)
I'm a spit that love flow
Forget what they all say
She the only one that help me
Hit her with a little bit of twelve play
When Twista wasn't poppin' I can remember telling the love doctor that I need some help
Nigga fire like I'm shocking I love to cock a pistol and I feel like I'm bleeding to death
My surgeon and my Methodist were the only ones I talked to
When I was left alone
You're the one that helped me fight through my challenges
Tell me what's my psychoanalysis
Exit (Twista)
Kells and Twist
Gotta let her know she's that's the only reason we make it through sometimes
That's why we sitting here in my rehab"

Saw a little motherfucker and y'all was ready to bend
Left the mob for something petty but then fetti got thin
Now you back where you begin while I'm livin' on ten
Got inns sittin' in a Benz wit rims sippin on Hen
Wit Stokes, Twist, and Mayze while you broke bitch I'm paid
Should have stayed but betrayed look at the cheddar you could have made
You started with the mob thought you was harder than the mob
But ain't no one motherfucker larger than this mob
Swear to god, for y'all C-Wall ain't got love
No only one that's gonna be on you side is this hot slug
For the dead and locked I'm throwin' my mob up
Cock and bust to all y'all bitches die for crossin us
(Liffy Stokes)
I smell some bitch niggas amongst us, now they gone
And when you see me on the streets be strapped 'cause I'm at you dome
And that's wit or without a mask on, 'cause I'ma blast on sight
Even if it's in traffic in broad daylight
The only way you live if it don't spray right
But you out your death wish so if I miss you'll be facin barrels by midknight
And that's on these four fingers I hold high
Anybody who crosses my mobsta family they die
I hollered at my boy James to bless me wit some mo' thangs
A mobstaz hard to kill like stopping off of cocaine
I'm leavin' out sweated no dynasty clicks crushin bitches wit this
Nigga your songs ain't shit, they can't even fade our skits eat a dick
Nigga cross the mob so what's up
In every destination retaliation gotta fuck 'em up
Nigga cross the mob so what's up
In every destination retaliation gotta get 'em up
Shit are y'all about ready to die for this fetti fuck everything that's petty
Down to do dirt lets put in work
Stay together whether we rappin' of slangin ye together
Get the paper but don't cross the mob and get hurt loyalty's first
(Traxster)
When everything was all good y'all niggas threw the wall up
But when the shit hit the fan I watch you bitches ball up
Now you time is all up, fuck who you call up
My niggas all bust, my killas all nuts
What the fuck you call us, what you say about C-Wall
Playa hatin' how we ball, nigga we'll be to see y'all
And you mob gonna end up the same homie, put this pain on you
No love my slugs got them thugs name on 'em
If he wit his kids I'm blow his brains on 'em, put the chains on 'em
Go insane on em', guess he done wit that work range on em
Rain over, so nigga respect my mob like royalty
Till I'm dead y'all hoes dred my love, life, and loyalty
(Twista)
When you come strapped in a circle
No I'm finna hurt you
Cause the mob put me peeped all of your loopholes
Cause the trigger work you
Bust all of you bitches and all of you hoes
When the bruh come
Thugs betta run shit look at what thugs want
See what drugs done
When held the gun got you runnin' from a loved one
Thought you was down to die but you been found to lie
So fuck you can't trust you, gotta bust you
Crush you now you can't lick hits and hustle
Try to flex your muscle
But my criteria gotta over comes yo strategies
Try to make a mob out of peas
I can ride on you wit Money-T and an amount of cheese
Plus I had a lot of bud in 'em
I get mad at the budgin' 'em
Whippin out the stud in 'em
But I ain't even studying
If again and it's on I just put a slug in him
Duggin him dead and headin hoes off at the pass
Open up a can of kick ass
Toy wit me loyalty die quick blast
(Maze)
I roll wit straight mobsta leaners
That always carry beamers
And exercising trigger fingers on niggas who come between us
Shockin' the world wit young slingers
And we can't be defeated, even if you triple team us
Cause this game got my mod deranged if you in pain
Kamokaze like my nigga Lo if we loose to you man
So ready to aim cause it ain't shit to explain
Shots to exchange plenty of paper in the game
To help us remain on top of the world until we go bang
Doin' our thang while y'all niggas just hate and complain in vain
But it'ws still gonna be the same we gonna mob forever
And out shine all you bitch ass niggas together

When I pull my h2 up to your h3
You know that you want to be in this movie
So don't be acting like a trippin' with a stranger mission
Recording you while you lovin' me down below
Switching the camera angle when we change positions
You could be the director aiming the camera down at me
Filming me licking until you say cut
Ready for any footage you wanna get
Ain't gotta call nobody else because
I do my own stunts
It's the X rated version of a box office hit
I see you ready to strip for this
So let me get the music in, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh oh)

Sexy, I wish I could film every bit of her
Kiss her neck down to her stomach and then I'ma
Tell her we could be in a personal cinema
I let you hold the camera first and then I hold it then
'Cause I wanna see how its coming out and goin' in
Let you see such a freak in me, I hope this never leak on TMZ this is 50 world star or CNN
Baby girl you kick the world off the axis
I'm yo director, filming you for practice
And you know I think you a hell of a actress
Especially when I'm shooting you on a matress
Shawty straight to the top that's where we headed
And I'ma see my name in the credits
And be the shit if you let it
See somethin' that you not really feelin'
Then we can always go back and make an edit
I'll be sippin on patron platinum
She knew about the rapping
But didn't know I'd be on acting
Now a personal reality show
So then, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh oh)

In the presence of a god, see how he thinks, oh, look how he talks
And I'ma come with the style, most of 'em like, then, most of 'em bite
Whether they go write it down, or spit it in, they, mobil device
Niggas could never compete, they lesser than me, I'm, destined to be
Run the Midwest and the reason the lesson'll be, one of the best in the streets
Takin' a lesson from me 'cause I'm wreckin the beat, a molecular special MC
If you wanna take it and be, with knowledge of self, there's no better weapon than me
And I hope you got the kush, gimme the woods, cause, I gotta smoke
And if you don't got the dough, then it'll be, adios, I gotta go
Unless you got somethin' to say, look at the time, no, look at the mind
Don't think about what I'ma do if it ain't about money or you don't say nothin' divine
I'm loving that you in the way, I wanna get, that, power and guap
Remember I used to get break, now I don't sleep, nope, now I don't stop
I do it for me and you
They wanna know why do I work work (c'mon)
Why do I smoke? So I could be turnt turnt (c'mon)
Why do I grind? So we can floss floss (c'mon)

C'mon; look at the rage, look at the night life
Listen to a dope individual, not one of them niggas who flowin so pitiful
Hopin to get with you so when you payin' attention your focus is critical
Snappin like a Kodak'll be, hope you get the picture, now Twista you notice I beast
Don't flow after me, I'll eat 'em up and then say ""Bon appétit""
And it'll be so depressin if I talk about everything that bother me
Millionaires livin' in the same country as people in poverty
So fuck you and your opinion, I'm on my own dominion
Street scriptures, hieroglyphics that ain't the book of the Gideons
An infinite era I'm in, travellin through a multiverse
Keepin' it smooth, I tell a motherfucker come insult me first
Can I get ahead of us and I can see you be scared of us
And you be talkin' et cetera, et cetera, but everybody'll know what you spit is a replica
Of what I do so I'ma just stay hot
And I be makin' the cash, and when she ask why I'm away a lot
I do it for me and you

Why do I smoke? So I could be turnt turnt (c'mon)

Hit k town and come back wit a bus load
Full of niggas that's down and dirty, pushin thirty
Minutes beef it gets muddy
But I'ma swim through the murky water
Hold it down like a carter, live long like a godfather
Kick Volvo's, fuck tight hoes
Live a life many kill and fight for
And campaign in this rap game, cause ain't nothing out
Here in these motherfucking
Streets man, and that's comin' from a nigga you know who chose
To be legit and still rip foes
Mob niggas, cause drama, till it's hot
Get shot, see the dot
Same day back on the block, set up shop
Hat throw thuggin', throwin' up
Fo's and forks, strapped up
Screamin out I ain't gon' never die
We can be shot at, battered and bruised
Bloody and left out in the cold
But real niggaz never fall, if I'm a hundred years old
I'm still gonna murder you
Cause mob niggaz don't die
(Turtle Banxx)
We release no doubt
Just close are eyes and open fire
Mash and bang on niggaz let them hot boys fly
You can tell a maniac got a look in his eye, card green, two
Magazines and a throw away knife
My position is thorough composition
Competition is minimum blocks
We bendin them shots
We're sendin them at the rhythm
Hit them put venom in them
Bloody up him in his jeans
And watch the white shirt study the scene
Gang bangin' ain't go' Never cease
As long as there's streets, police and heat, dope rocks and weed
Chronic, empty stomachs and mouths to feed
Who want it niggaz off the deed
The K Town we spray round
So stay down, this ain't no play ground around here
You could get found around here
Shot up, battered and bruised
Headline of the news
The chosen, the few, mob niggaz don't die fool
(Liffy Stokes)
Hey, my papa told me, boy if, you wanna be a G
You gots, to flip them keys
And avoid, them federalies
'Cause they, be on that ass
Ready to blast fast
Nigga fuck ask they take it, an' I'm shakin' off
Charges like Payton
Hot stepping out the courtroom in gators, true playaz
No the business
No case without a witness, its senseless to resist this
Hostile take over
To late to pray to Jehovah, death closer, I lit him up like a toaster
Then put my shit back in my holsta
Blood crumbled on the posters
I gave a foe like a nigga was supposed ta
(Twista)
Shit, was wit the bogus bird, I don't want it
I can tell when I rub my finger across it it got sumthin on it
Fuck it if you niggaz wanna get killed wit a chick in the coat
Cause you can die wit the dick in the throat, hittin the dro
Back on the block servin'
After the murder packin
For work 'cause we're lucky popo's ain't havin' 'em nervous
Think what I was in, family show up, an' the enemy
They lay, got it locked wit ten rolls
If they spray, fuck it
I'ma come back in the buck n'bloody fractures on my body
Bustin' out on the public, bringin' the ruckus
Screamin, die punk motherfuckers
Reminice on how them hoes put the nigga on crutches
Smokin' on dutches, fifty sack in my clutches
Ballin no flows go, hataz Askin' how the mob's so strong
I belong to the breathin' niggaz that wanna take over after pop
Label me the verbal aftershock
I'ma never die!"
97,Mob Up,1998,Mobstability (1998),Midwest Rap,Twista,"Yeah, mobsta style for you muthafuckas, you know what I'm sayin'
We fin to bring this shit like this here
This muthafuckin' Chi shit, check it out
The niggas in my mob can't be touched
You best to mob up to come fuckin' with us, oh no
Niggas in my mob bring the heat
You best to mob up fuckin' with the elite, oh no
(Liffy Stokes)
You just a bitch in the sky, I hear cries
'Cause you can't whistle for your guys
Surprise when you saw this pistols in your eyes
So I peal like mere mortals, bet I shoot bloody portals
To muthafuckas who owe us, niggas die, causin' horrifyin' pictorals
My passion for blastin' made me an assassin on all enemies that work us
Whose purpose is to serve (?) timbs till they high and they hurt us
Murders got us murders, I pull my weed and gun out
Blastin' till they run in the house while I got the blunt in my mouth
(Mayz)
We in a rage bustin' rapidly like when I'm on stage
It don't get no rougher than Liffy Stokes, Twista and Mayz
In the blood of your day, then lay flat on your back
Then while he fuckin' your hoe
The mob gon' be straight coppin' you stack
(Twista)
Your mob lacks, I'ma defeat you run three-two on contact
Cogniac, get me strapped with the black gat itchin' to bomb back
Hoes can't get no sleep
Bullets hit your chin for the grief that you bring us
Shots hit his face as he grabs his chest
Then we watch him bleed through his fingers
Now come on, come all, but if all come all fall, fuck all y'all
We road dawgs, then I come gunnin', niggas runnin' like they sold y'all
In the heat of the night, the (?) static we start up
Guards up, while we come strapped they come ready to mob up
(Chorus 2 w/ 1)
If it's static, one of my niggas gon' get two niggas
Two of my niggas gon' get four niggas
Four of my niggas gon' get more niggas
That's more triggers meaning more killers
You muthafuckas better mob up
(Repeat)
(Liffy Stokes)
It's a static, it's automatic, so grab the automatics
And pumps and pull the triggers and make some niggas look acrobatic
I was cold but frantic, the foes have panicked
They got bloods blew out their dome, bet the bullets run rapid
I kept bustin' for the love of hustlin' squeezin' my wesson
Ruger, gang (?) maneuvers, niggas wanna be bruisers but I'm a shooter
Fuck the squad, because when it's said and done
Liffy Stokes will do some poppin'
(Short Skit)
(Liffy Stokes)
Nigga the devil's knockin' at your fuckin' door
With some hot ones and toe
And ready to hit 'em with nothin' less than four
Nigga let me go, I'm 'bout to pop this bitch
You know you know the lick, art of the mobsta click
Fuck the argument, mob elite's runnin' up apartments
Kickin' in doors pistol whippin' hoes be heartless
Searches as the bullets marches between your arches
Make one call and wait and reload the cartridge
(Chorus 2 w/ 1) - (2x)
(Mayz)
You can't even mess with a mobsta, nigga, is you sick in the head
I torture that ass and have you overdosing on lead
Or maybe I just leave you cut up, drippin' and dead
With your crew skippin' town scared, my lead gon' lead their ass red
Don't get misled, don't mistake me for somebody but a soldier
The elite niggas got more death than AIDS and ebola
Getting old and colder
I be quick to (?) start uppin' but that chip off your muthafuckin' shoulder
(Twista)
Behold the stack folder, gun holder, AKA blunt roller
Mayz if I die for you get your (..?..) and trap holder
To hurt particular niggas comin' with perpendicular figures
Crushin' triggers, y'all niggas better bring back some memos
(Mayz)
It really don't matter if that nigga pack a glock or a gauge
'Cause whatever the fuck Mayz blaze gon' make him see his last day
Takin' 'em out, my life and makin' sure his cast stays
Jack 'em for his last days, that's how livin' fast pay
Nigga, you know the word on the street
It's the mobsta elite that's servin' the streets to the rockin' these beats
You better have a nice way to greet us than rolling with your guys
And you could still die in a multiple homicide
(Chorus 2 w/ 1) - (2x)
Let's mob up"

Nineteen-ninety-muthafuckin'-eight
Mobsta elite's back up in this muthafuck 'em (Bitch)
And we airin' out all you playa-hatin-lame-ass niggas
And we on this laid-back track, something smooth
Eh yo, Mayz, whatcha don' do, kick it
(Mayz)
And ride on, niggas get your high on
While we pump this shit to vibe on
The muthafuckin' mobsta elite'll leave you breathless
When we hit you like this
Early in the morning, hop into the Chevy Caprice
I'm hurtin', so I'm thinkin' of ways to gettin' paid
Cheddar in a bundle, fifties and hundreds and G stacks
If I could just hit that big lick I could relax
And ease back off of thuggin' and stick to hustlin'
Concentrate on paper and let the shorties do the bustin'
While I motivate on power moves, you live be coward rules
Singing the blues while I pack shit that'll knock you out your shoes
'Cause I'm a fool playing the game of the streets
Claiming elites, making sure my family eats
We roll and it flees, bunkin' niggas out of their seats
While mobbin' on beats, soon niggas can't back down or retreat
Preventing mine, just doing petty crimes, I'm not petty or nice
Standin' in line, calmly waitin' on my time to shine
'Cause when I shine, I'ma glisten
As all the heads come up missing
I'ma slide in and assume the position
My mom's stick thick, who the killas and convicts
Bulletproof now, pistol holsters under the arm pits
Ready to go out in the blaze of glory
Standin' firm on the deck makin' the front-page story
When your mobs' at your side and they're ready to ride, nigga
(Nigga, that's mobstability)
And when you go from movin' O's to keys for more cheese
(Fool, that's mobstability)
And when it's money over bitches 'cause you're stackin' your riches
(Playa, that's mobstability)
Gettin' your mind right for payin' for the year 2G
(Gotsta be mobstability)
(Liffy Stokes)
I heard a raw beat, somebody told me the funk did it
But if Trax didn't do it I can't fuck it
'Cause it's a family thang
You know Chi-Town's the motherland of the wild
The chain of mobsters and gangs
But we're the elite few that just can't be contained
Tippin' only the plane, determine it's about the game
Like a playa stays the same, ain't tryin' to act strange to change
'Cause the more paper you got, the more you got to slang
And there's more haters to bang 'cause they all want a piece
You got to be slick as grease 'cause they want the playas deceased
Restin' in peace
But my motto's simply too tight for you to threaten my life
With a knife, gun or mic
You don't really wanna fight so just swallow your pride
Before I come inside your crib and kidnap the shorty and bride
Every nigga alive wish he had a psycho status
Will your punks ready to ride so the bitches can come at us
In the city of thugs, police, politicians and drugs
If they ain't passin' the bubble, niggas carry a grudge, but no love
So I don't give a muthafuck if you killin' me
I'm pissin' out headshots, protestin' my mobstability
(Twista)
If I'm not into nothing, I don't feel right
So I circle the block strapped
Watching the workers while they circle muthafuckas at night
They work to tippin' me 'cause dope fiends ain't wangers
These wanches are skanches, this ain't just how the cracks and hiatus
My crew react tamers than sweat hogs, to protect that (?) bomb
But no teflon, your flesh was tearin', for the love of this heron
I bare arms and I'm quick to snatch cards to those who react hard
Don't judge these, got you robbed, I'ma get more cheddar for my black mob
My legion is broke down into sections to run every regions
Slugs and thugs, rifles for rifles 'cause we walk every season
Having shootin' apartments, cars with hidden compartments for po-pos
Zip polos holding pistolos and mobstas know those
Sooner then booted, looted then zooted, (?) shoes so can I
Automatics but semi, then I, watches your midnight
'Cause I be handlin' my function when the nine-milliter get to jumpin'
Dumpin' on niggas who claimin' my muthafuckas ain't worth for nothin'
I'm bustin', how's game I peep when I was a shorty
Having big dreams on money, cars and bitches by the time I reach forty
Nation affiliation, dummy paper-chase and willin'
For pay probabilities only seen through mobtability, feelin' me"

Mobsters reign, we hope you feel this
Speedknot Mobsters
My click been strugglin half a lifetime tryin' to get our shit on
Got no G's to sit on, even so niggas sell packs to get on
But let me take you to a place
Where these niggaz learn to better pain and stress
Look a murderer in the face, comin' up with a wilder range you're blitzed
1, 2, 3, and to the 44, the good, the bad, and the ugly sticken you
Fleein through the front door, and we gotta do one more
Even though dealer watchin me like the lottery
We can still fulfill this westside oddessy mobster prophecy
Well mobbin what can be better than weed, drinks, bitches and loot?
Hangin' off 20 G's cause you got more money to scoop
Lives a hustler by nature, fiend for paper, schemes and capers
Constantly eyed by neighbors, who do the Feds favors?
It ain't no major dough, what this lady yeya blow
As long as its payin' me for my occupation criminal
Pullin up on hoes, as the weed smoke blows, the absence of a mobsters presence
Is the reason she chose, as the regency rolls, it rolls, the pearl white O's
Mobile, shit I'm a ride high till I die, get killed
Smoke like fields, forever dodgin blue shields,
We're blue steel I got full proof escape skills
We're paper chasin leavin' trails of shell cases
And chasin to the part of your body
Where the bloods wasted, on the life taken
Chicago ain't a city it's a nation
It's all this my foundation within the mobster organization
If it's gonna be shakin it up, if it's gonna be cookin it up
If it ain't hustlin and we got some skunk we gonna be smokin' it up
(Well I'm a payin' mobster for life, caught with gold and ice)
(Speedknots roll two shots too cold to die, know I'm a get high)
It's an everyday thang for my Speedknot Mob to hang
Callin cops for thangs, readin to squab or bang
Takin' your riches, 'cause we know we snatchin your bitches
The wish I reign my family gotta maintain, it's a mobster thang
I'm a fat booty fuckin', love gettin' the sucks in and bustin'
Givin' niggers punkin heads for nothin', while bumpin, handle my functions
My pistles pumpin, got hoes jumpin', a mobstas always into somethin'
I can feel Killuminati lookin' over my shoulder
Somethin' keeps tellin' me to get mine before it's over
Smokin' on plenty of buddahs, the brand to get blessed, with forgiveness
For the last time I'm sent on the survivin quest
From hustlin 24-7 to makin' niggas get undressed
The mobster in me got to be obsessed
With lucci and success, so I can care less
If I gotta be lootin and woopin,
I'm sick of beggin niggas for rides
Id rather be the one that's scoopin
Cause in these last days its day to day hustlin for me, I won't rest here
Everyday
Fat ass chain and 3 blades,
Trippin' on that 2 faced, that nigga sweatin dick
While I rock the stage,
Like these bitches is just tryin' to get paid to give a nigga AIDS
Like I can use it for turnin' tricks
Or either for hittin licks and then rap about the shit
In one the mobster's greastest hits,
And when we come to your town (?) then raise it
Finest skunk we just can roll it up and blaze it
I'm gonna make it through this New World Order if I gotta be rappin' and robbin
You can't stop the Speedknot from mobbin and if you try we squabin
We waitin for you to fall off the square so you best keep your head up
When these shots how niggas roll, 'cause we don't believe in goin' head up
On this week 100's, 50's, and dubs, trigger finger itchy with snubs
Hit me wit love, black gloves, red eyes (?)
T-shirt up on my face, fucked up and ready, I cocked the 380,
Got a grip that was steady adrenaline
Rushin po-feddy, while lives is rolled with Sisqo
May we rock the tightest flows but tinto up with the clips though
Gotta find out what yo pockets hit fo, 'cause I ain't that scummie
Mother fuck (?) got no time for rockin',
Choppin in the car stoppin' with a stack ofpacked money
But you trustin me, then I cup this shit,
Snatch all of your luxury, try touchin me
Actin' tough as shit, my moms is a bust for me
Fuckin' me or make me hate you,
Permanently sedate you, when the bullet penetrate
You its goin' straight for your face you, unless we chase you
When we escape through your pockets
By all means necessary the rest is secondary
Comin' for back till my flesh is buried, the test is carried for me to survive
And hope we still will be thick, with a trilogy click but now seven
Mobstability shit
Ha, I just take a pull in the hail,
Thinkin' about my niggas that's locked up in jail
My mind dwells on crime sales, we wipin off mad shells
Only time will tell if we gotta use em'
Ain't lookin' for stack, but if we got into it
We gotta do it, ha, mobster anthem for life"

The stress of everyday living is slowly corrupting my soul
I'm 2 months out the joint on papers walking with 3 years parole
I did 4 and a half a slab and shit a nigga was dying
I'm finally back in the world and its hard but I'm still trying
Not to fall and risk my freedom again trying to ball
While waiting for this pussy ass job to call
And it ain't hopping
Got me tipping to hear them things popping
Cash bags dropping
With plenty of cane for recopping oppurtunity knocking
It's what I'm on
I cry when I'm at home 'cause I'm alone
24 years and grown with a future unknown
My heart was torn from the pain of being back in the game
But I'd rather die getting my hussle on and live like a lane
So its back to pistols and cane
Plotting on licks hitting stains
The mob life runs through my veins
It's too late for me to change
These streets got me deranged
Strapped up and paranoid
Ready to add on situations I can and can't avoid
Plus big voices getting hot
They constantly sneaking on blocks
They trying to bring me in unconscious
But them pins got popped
Now they got me on the run
Cherishing every last breath
But I ain't going back
Its freedom or death
That be my motive for murder
(Begin CHORUS)
(Liffy Stokes)
Now I know you the judge of life and death
I ain't evil or nothing
But somebody done brought me pain and sorrow
So I'ma have to kill something
Let me count the ways that I can repent
Trying to stay holy and focused
But that evil in his eyes let me know that nigga too bogus
That be my motive for murder

I'ma survive these streets another day
I know the pain in my heart won't go away
These mother fuckers try to murder me
And won't nobdy hurt my family

9 times out of 10 you can find Mays trying to hit a better lick

Where bitch niggas trick
And thirsty mother fuckers beat you out of everything you get
But it seems like everybodys trying to make some type of come up
Quick
Before it's too late to get straight
And the most I make is final pick
Anywhere they shit like riding slick
With a thick chick slobbing your dick
Even if it means fighting these niggas in cases
As long as neither ones thick
'Cause I swear when I get hit
I go in a crucial rage like a flick
Turn straight lunatic
Making all these bitches niggas hear their final tick
But that don't mean my minds sick
Just 'cause I'm motivated by a lot of cheese
When trees by the p's
And fuckin' fine fee's and 3's with ease
For sho the skilled poets
Within in the mask up kill for it
I'll whoop a fiend with a crushed grill
I'll bet his dumb ass'll stil blow it
Bullshit ain't nothing
I'm trying to get this first mil in the bank
And drive a bullet-proof hummer tank
So the next haters who try to air me out come up blank
And I'ma have to sacrifice your life
With a wrath that's stronger than Christ
And forces of life that's know to do damage to human eyesight
I guess its true
Moneys the route of all evil
Cause crooked or legal
It's all manipulated by the eagle
And be my motive for murder

Lord knows I was hurt from a judge from the start
How I'ma hide love from this mark
This nigga made my homie die in my arms
Had to put a slug in his heart

Took his dreams and wishes
Try to do right but my attitude like blast them bitches
Drowning all my sorrows in bottles of yack
And a quarter ounce of dro want a rap

Here come the big pay back
Looking up on the dresser for the black and gray strap
I'm crying and shit
I was hurt so bad I felt I had to go kill him
Even if a slug hit him

Can't control them pains

Taking of his nikes
I know it sound cold
But this bullet put a hole in my soul

And at the funeral I got to watch his mama's tears roll
And I know he used to wild sometimes
Carry a 9 but you took away your sunshine

Balling and coming at bitches with blunt lines
But this nigga ain't going to want mine
For the pain I'ma handle this funk and dismantle this junk
Fuck all that
In all black and then pumped
To run up on this nigga
Tip up on him then jump
Mission to kill armed with a fist full of steel
Eyes gleam with the fury

I know you skeptical on dating based on your past relations
But I got patience plus I'm waiting on the right occasion
I'm yours for the taken ain't no mistaking this
Alone to see ya face and be bracing with every kiss
I'm hating the time we missed the fellas don't understand
It don't matter them are boys and I'm a man
Your boyfriend Buddy you calling him husband
When you not looking he trying to holla at ya cousin (thought he wasn't)
Play like it ain't nothing can't disguise the hurt in your eyes
Late nights I hear your cries for loving
(Johnny P) Come on baby
(Chorus - Turtle Banxx, Johnny P)
(T) In my apartment, slip into your sexy garment
Candle lights and music set the tone now convince me darling

'Cause if it's ok we can play in my apartment

Street hustling now became thangs of the past
Money at last again help me baby channel this anger
Ready to blast at oppositions
They don't give me the chamber
I talk the strangest cause my homies only want paper
Don't get me wrong I won't put you in danger the nature of the streets
Ready to claim another life asking God to save us forgiven hearts
The tamers the youth is hard to train em
They only want money and cars status and stars living ghetto famous
Ain't this the shamest lets resolve the changes so they won't be namest
Broke starving and banging
Like that old saying home is where the heart is gods will gods will
(Chorus - Turtle Banxx, Johnny P)
(T) In my apartment, slip into your sexy garment
Candle lights and music set the tone now convince me darling
(P) Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Is it all right if I lay you down
On my waterbed while we smoke this pound
Got ya feeling buzzed off the Hennesey
Tell ya girl that you wanna ride with me
Meet me out front in my six fo' fo'
I spit a little game now I got you home
And when ya man ask where you've been
Been with me in my apartment
Baby I want to play... let's go all the way

Mmmmm let's get it started girl
I really want to play... take me away
In my apartment in my apartment

Relaxin maxin to the maximum
To tracks a hum
The wicks where the stacks are from
Inside the styles of a funky lyrical wiz
What a miracle is
Get down to spiritual business
Now my tongue kissed
Put words in your system wished em
Respect the blackness em
Give in 'em win 'em the peace they want
But don't want the peace signs unless its in the mind
Become a victim because I kick 'em sick em
Supposed to be black but they be wack
Those who pretend to be a muslim I gooshed em
Positive ones I pushed em
Into the path or righteousness might get dissed
Those who pump a fist but ain't right with this
I increase rhymes wacks and weak minds
If it ain't real stop throwin' up peace signs
Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
Untied we can get over, yet were still apart
Terror wished 'em ima terrorize elorize in disguise
Those for side for tizin and I begin
To creepin' seepin thought out unrighteousness and dissed
Connect of venomous gangs with the rhytmness
Figured they manifestin g I can address
Individually each emcee is throwin' up peace but don't pray to the east
I write the lect the soul should be playin' towards mecca
But snakes and devils wont letcha
Freestyle some religious free dump see
To letcha know how come dumb some be
Ignorance a comish to look like a fish
And since we whipped from bars to a ghetto priz
Ima wiz some brains I give 'em a brain washin
When I'm walkin' devils I'm squashin
Science fiction mixed in tricks in fixin
The ways of all sort for good
Come in my fortress ima gonna force this
'Cause it holy don't try to fold me
Some just say peace tryin' to the black guy
Some say peace thinkin' it means bye bye
So g if ya never mean this from the heart and the mind
Stop throwin' up peace signs
Lets walk the path of a vo-cab-ulary
You'll cary the thoughts of every righteous man
Lets fight this plan of a other man
Waxin thoughts of a brother man
Satans waitin for us to be hatin' each other
Sister brother or mother color
Blackness don't try to attack this fact this lets now practice
True peace new salon one who is a peace
Cease when you see hunger than give peace
Blacks a supplied them and applied them identified them
You suffer inhale and say why them
'Cause you did not follow the path that I laid out
Say blackness and get played out
Like children wildin some try to kick a fist
Pick a fist I take a piss wikedness to get crushed up
Movin up on that bustop while stand inhale bustop
So you must stop
Fakin the holy faith in wakin'
Star don't come apart our hearts get a stake in
So don't be mad so what minds to the minimum
'Cause in the 'em sendin 'em holy wisdom
To let you know from the heart and the mind
Stop throwin' up peace signs"

Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga (put down that 45)
Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga (gotta let that 40 ride)
Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga (let's do a homicide)
Don't ever wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga
Don't wanna see you with that 45 unless you gon' ride
If I say you gon' die motherfucker I get so loud
What you be procrastinating I think you fuck around with pistols 'cause they fascinating
You motherfuckers ain't gon' do nothing
When you get through frontin niggas out here already know that you ain't gon' shoot nothing
End up at the pearly gates when they test you
Gotta dirty face but what you know about a 30 ain't special shit
And I know them hard words make you jump up with your? when you got the mosburg pump bitch
And the shortys lookin' at you like a punk bitch
Cause you ain't making what you claim ain't gon' dump click
You gon cry when you hear them bullets dumping when them shortys come and ride on you (when the pistol click clack)
If you still alive will you really get the dumpin if you got that 45 on you?
Once upon a time in the sha there was three real killas who bust guns and puff fire
They cut weight by the key and baggin every gram
Instead? bustin' with the pistol in they hand
I'm preachin murder like a vicious reverand
About niggas who claim they shootin but they never seen 357s
Now what reason would you hold it up
Put that pistol down nigga pick that weed up roll it up
Twista up the light you don't really won die
Stop your blood clot crying
Your bullets don't fly
? Aim smooth? I keep that smith and wessel with me like I'm blackmoon
Toss up the living room storm through the kitchen
I caught that nigga in the bathroom shittin and pissin'
What you shakin' for I thought you said you ready to ride
Don't be coming with me if you ain't strapped because I
I keep a p95 nine milli ruger
You fuckin' with a shooter
Quick to bloody your suit up
My aim impeccable point like a decibel
300 feet away in a tower snipin a festival
What you know about 9's and glock 40's
And 45's see our 15's with the 5 pound slide
Thirty shot clips snub noses with the rubber grips
Wicked techs that'll put the kiss of death on your lover's lips
[? ] We get the squeeze nigga
Ak-47s make them bitches retreat nigga
Like a g nigga
I make 'em bleed nigga
? I'm bustin' that's on my c nigga
My war chest is filled with ballers and techs
Ski masks gloves and vests so nigga what's next nigga
It's real thuggin' you a bitch to the bone
If you ain't go through nothin' shorty leave them pistols alone"

I hang wit pullers of automatic triggers and gold diggers
My mob's full of go getters
Go live or die by the cold niggas
Wit drama bringers ear ringers and pistol slingers with itchy fingers
Getting high on inhaling nigga smoke that lingers
Buck wild hostile we verbal barrels threw nostrils
My hollow point apostles turn living flesh into fossils
It's through gospel niggas will wet it vick Malif'll shred it
Beef on these streets only gets the best of you if you let it
(Malif)
Well it's that Westside nigga from K-Town always gonna stay down
Lay pounds on the table, smoking while watchin cable
I'm able to lick the shot from the porch of my block
And when the gun spray stops there's no information for cops
Nigga I'm heartless some say I role wit the forces of darkness
But the closest I burned to death is the reason that I spark this (Spark this what)
Dramafied premeditated homicide that coincides with the day you die
Cause G, I'm about to let it ride
Petty niggas down when the bullets fly,
No remorse your fuckin' wit a mobsta
For fuckin' wit a mobta
If you got your shit right then run and hide,
'Cause I got a slip quick clip on the side
For fuckin' wit a mobsta
(Turtle)
Fuck the car jack we do a body snatch
Tie niggas up in the trunk wit them rats like a mac for owning scratch
SpeedKnot's unstoppable muderin as many niggas as possible
Makin' heaven a hospital, and where I'm from it's highly probable
In a Benny reefa roller street patroller stackin clips for lethal loadin
In the city where secrecy's golden
Live or die in the Chi, we kill demeanors wit inferred beamers
Death is the sinner
Whether the Reaper awaits your fate with your soul on his finger
(Mayze)
Nigga you can't retreat
When the Mobstaz greet you with bullets like Robert De Niro on Heat
And makin' killin' look sweet
See a nigga like Mayze break the safety I hold the clip till infinite
To show your definite when I make you cry blood like I broke your virginity
Shit my Mobstaz is straight cheat vs. killers for cash
Quick to stick your ass and flash this 3-80 and rainbow macs
And now you thinking of bringin' that bull shit in this direction
Just cause you rap a lot don't mean you can't get a lethal injection
(Link)
Picture Link the mercenary fuckin' you like missionary
Position them missile carriers precision till them bitches buried
But a mobstaz sip on Sherries snitch niggas sing like canaries
Where we wrong be carrying clone Periyon and Herringbone
We on the streets in territory we chill come and get you chest pealed
Hot steal and banana clips standing on tip you get your flesh filled wit rhinos
Energies feel for my soul they holdin' captive
Visions of living strengthy posses me lets make it happen
(Twista)
Smokin' on sweet reef for the beat freak
'Cause it's in the heat seaker of the street sweeper
Think I'm lying if you want shit is deadly as slugs
Got you swimming in the blood like sea creatures
Cause you done lit to the land of the lost
Where our straps looking as pretty as bitches
But pullin up in a hearse to a church is the curse of these hideous witches
Hittin hoes wit, 44's and four by fours wit the pain of a figure four
Wounds hit you like a hit will blow
Every nigga on this track I'll pull a trigger for
If you test the rock vest, pullin slugs like a lockness
I'm a for show protect my chest
Everything in holes is what I unload and not less
Until meals make progress
Y'all niggas no who y'all be never let me see your face in my spot
While you still be facin your block I'ma be erasing you block
Snappin off like Jason on rocks tastin your knots
'Cause when it's pockets for profit
I can't stop it this mob got me
If you ain't gonna pop it don't cock it
'Cause if we working you, ready to us carrying clips that's reversible
Takin' all our business personal diss wit a verse we all hurtin' you
Bull shit aside, (Niggas is knowin' I fill another wit holes and not hide)
Better role if not ride unless you hoes don't got pride
No remorse when your fuckin' wit a SpeedKnot Mobsta
(Chorus 2x, variation on last 2 lines)
If you got your shit right then run and hide
'Cause I got a slip quick clip on the side and drop ya
For fuckin' wit a mobsta"

Disgruntled motherfuckers and suckers, today we call 'em haters
I'm so major, hoes on me and they wanna fight
They wanna bite 'cause I'm original like Bobby Digital
My style is critical and yours intermediate
I'm just a rappin' legacy, I got the recipe
For cookin up and servin', and they likin the ingredients
I'm mackin', I'm a genius, a flow of horror, I could peep your
Aura and see what your inner feelings might be
Niggas talkin' shit 'cause they ain't used to bein'
In the same room with a legendary nigga like me
Some of 'em really wanna be me and they want my car, ho
And they flow like me
Niggas wanna take away my style, they can get it how I get it
But they money never grow like me though
How I live it is exquisite and the picture is so vivid that the riches
Are not only monetary but within the body and the mental
Spectacular graphics in back of a plethora of energy
Vocally vibratin rhythms through a instrumental
Spit and tellin' niggas you don't really want it
Bitches you don't really want it
Think I'm dissin even when it's hypothetical and I ain't really on it
I'm known to body my opponents
Should I say opposition, in my position I'm expected to be venomous
I beat 'em down verbally the way I rap
Like it was multiples of me, I fuck 'em up like it was ten of us

If I didn't know how I spit'll be the conversation of lyricists
Congregation'll fit with this, I'll leave you volatile
If you got a style you prob'ly got it from hearin Twist
A certain section of my '97 patterns
My 2004 lyrics, how they copy
Cadences and mannerisms, I can tell it when I hear it
I can tell it when I hear it
And I'm never specific 'cause if I do
A nigga gon' take it the wrong way
I'll fuck him up for whatever he gon' say
Dependin on who he be I'm thuggin' like I'm PeeWee Longway
Blowin' after a long day
And I want my haze, kush
And my diesel too
How you ain't gon' have nothin' to roll up with me
If you gon' fuck with me if I be blowin' weed with you though?
Old fake-ass niggas, they be the reason I don't fuck with them
All over the dick when they see the Gucci

Blowin' for when they free my lil' brother and free Lil Boosie

That I'ma rock in the funky party with
They think I won't, but watch how fly the party get
They follow me, follow me, black, I'm not wick-wack
They follow me, follow me, black, I'm not wick-wack
MC's be ever so angry 'cause I step in the fortress
Then I rock the party because I rock everybody
They follow me, follow me mic chants
I tell the men 'say ho', they say 'ho'
Follow me mic chants
I tell the men 'say ho', they say 'ho'
A victim of the way I kick them flows
I chose 10 bros I picked from 10 shows to rock the 10 toes
I make the rhythm rough enough to make the feet scuff
Across the floors and rock them dirty drawers
I see your sweat pours, ya step with no flaws
I rock the second show with cuts like chainsaws
The mic is yours
I rock the 2nd show
2 down, 1 2 go (8X)
Me comin' to flo-ow, oh-oh
It's time to rock a 3rd show
Flo-ow, oh-oh, it's time to rock a 3rd show
Me stamina rocks again
The tick-tocks of clocks again
Drops the men, they need some oxygen
If suckers think I'm wack I call 'em out like bingo
Or ooh-uno 'cause I do know hip-hop judo and you know
The hip-hop chops rocks akis, don't drop no abc's
'Cause I only drop these to drop knees
Please, dis a Chicagod, ya lose
'Cause I can rock with stars and still get ahs and oohs
And voodoos choose to put me on tours, I rock like this
I rock a male and rock a female, ay y'all, pump the fist
Because I be rockin' the funky words and cheers are heard
That be the 3rd show - 3 down, no mo' 2 go
I rock the 3rd show
3 down, no mo' 2 go (8X)"

Princess cuts hurt ya eyes,
Got tha chicks that work them thighs,
Pull the top back on the prowler,
Like tha car ain't circumcised
Burglarize hoes,
Leave ya eyes closed,
Bricks in my truck while I ride slow,
Smoke yo fire dro,
No repercussions,
He was disgusting,
Turn my volume under ten,
To keep my speakers from busting,
If them people come rushin,
Can't say I froze,
Won't open the doors,
Bout time they caught up,
I done exposed of my outer clothes,
Car in tha garage,
I say good God,
My day was hard,
Call two freaks up for tha m'nage trios,
Parlaying hard,
Sade was suave
When we was screwing,
Sheets was ruin
If beef is brewing,
I'mma put slugs deep into,
Money they be pursuing,
The nerve of these jealous bastards fo hatin',
Master my patience,
Them custom wood grain caskets is waitin,
Passion for satin
They must have
Gave them a blood bath
Had to show them who really holdin' shit down wit they tuff ass,
We alias
They wishin they be us,
Can't three eighty us,
'Cause we'll wreck everything within a ten-block radius,
When ya see me betta speak with love,
Or leak some blood,
I got connections with all type of BM, Chiefs, and GOVS
Deeply plugged who gotta retire from crime
Bout to hit that big lick
So we gonna pull it
One last time
I got some good news man,
Some good news,
We gone come up if we just make this quick move
Lay it all on the line,
Hit'em in the body and da dome,
Left tha after party wit tha chrome
Come up wit a milly
Soon as everybody know that I'm gone
'Cause I made it mama your son he's a success,
Now you ain't got no reason to stress
Gotta keep it Gangsta,
'Cause I'ma Hustla
Do it like a balla,
'Cause I'ma a mobsta
Cause it only takes a second to pop me a snitch,
Call up my connection and cop me a brick,
And he sent a chezovoceian chick,
She was actin' cocky and shit,
She like watchin blow at the hotel
Wit big dreams to never stop being rich,
And she wasn't too sloppy wit dick,
Said when she get on she was gonna cop me a six,
Platinum blue spreewell shoes,
Detail smooth,
On some Mickey and malery me and my female crews,
Type of demo what's tha beno
I gave her two six plus ten four,
That's twelve five for the brick,
And five hundred for the plane and limo,
Plain and simple called my guy and told'em thanks and send more,
Meditating plot on my lick when I smell them frankensen blow,
Do my thugdizle I ain't scared of this,
Fly ya head like peagus,
Bloody up that necklace,
Hoe I'ma Aries,
Them terrorist fucked up tha lick when sendin chicks on tha plane,
Put a major glitch in tha game
But I'm get me them thangs
As I come wit new ways to travel watch my shorties get on em
Comin' back wit pound and packages wit tha scorpions on them,
Of course we been on them,
Niggas know they two for forty and want'em
I done seen truck load wit more keys than accordion
And you think I'm past up that quick fast dust,
Let me mask up
That ain't a fast truck,
Get yo ass stuffed,
I spit words that be gangsta shit
Make hustla tip and ballers rich,
Hatters sick mobsta hitz,
I'm tha shit,
You can't see me visit the optometrist,
Cars I flip unorthodox like Dr. Bonovich,
Prada lic but nigga got whooped,
Should have seen shit was funny,
My old connection he got reason to gun me,
I know he took tha money,
Even if I probably wrong,
Turn down tha volume,
Shoot him on plastic to lay his body on,
Fuckin' marcon,
Two to tha caveza,
Pincha puto,
That ring on your pinky was too cold,
Got pinch for two O's,
And a half brick my staff is sick,
Had him confess like a catholic,
Always thought things was funny now you don't laugh at shit,
Stupid bastard bitch,
Never fuck wit Twista, Turtle Banxxs, and Stokes,
Coming up dro flowin slangin dope
I tried to chill,
But when I see a lic to make the world mine,
On tha love,

Damn, the fuck y'all get this weed from?
Motherfucker overdose or some shit off this shit, god damn
Check this shit out though...
(Twista)
Now pussy player haters say that I'm too raw with it
But y'all thinkin' 'cause I be talkin' shit
Them hoes say that nigga cold as hell
Fuck what the punks are talkin' bout
I wanna get up with that big ballin bitch
Plus niggas feelin' what I'm on as well
Plus got my mind in the zone
The one that's rocking fresh Pelle Pel's
Sweet tooth'll shine on his bone
Somebody beatin' up the block on fresh rider rims
If it's me hell, you can tell by the design on the chrome
Crying on the phone
Hoe thinkin' I'm in love with her
'Cause she took me shoppin' and had me tryin' on cologne
So I left her on the line with the tone
Got up with this other bitch
Brought no weed 'cause she fire'n up her own
So hurry with the Phillie bitch, I'm really sick
Off of some illa shit
Here go a rusty razor blade, but still it split
And fill it with the killer shit so I can really trip
It's like the bud was tailor made for milli-clips
And mac-10's, I lit the b from the back end
Straight to the chest and it got me sprung
My lungs started collapsing - shit nigga what's happenin'?
The sess got me trippin' off the drums and guns, ready for action
Duck a swang or either other thang
Try to be tough and bang and scuff and hang
Suffer pain left deranged then youse a bogus m'uhfucker mayn
Since the beat struck a vein, I'm too strange
For m'uhfuckers to compete with
I'm on some infrared heat shit
With a deep clique, what I eat sleep shit
Well if it's a freak bitch, she can suck a sweet dick
Till she's seasick; blockin niggas out like an eclipse
When smokin' them devils put your hands together
Like you know the host
Cause ain't no nigga that can resist the words from the Twist'
Leavin' niggas comatose from my overdose
Chorus: Twista
I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
We overdosin on weed and sendin all y'all off into a thang
Kill off all enemies while makin' G's, catch you off on your knees
And snatchin fees now that I'm up in this game
I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
We overdosin on weed and sendin all y'all off into a thang
Kill off all enemies while makin' G's, catch you off on your knees
Niggas rollin' me b's just so they can hang
(Twista)
Can you figure out the cause and effect?
Niggas comin' on your set
Thugs comin' out they drawers with a tec
Victim bleedin from the neck
Shirts is getting wet, shorties yellin' threats
Lookin' for the one who called for the deck
Now they airin out the hall in the spot
Hitting stomachs leavin' niggas pinched up
Bodies balled in a knot
Bullet holes in the wall from a glock
Searchin for the one who called in the shots
Hypes crawlin for rocks
Goin' all in the socks of the recently deceased
From what was released
From the chrome beast to the dome piece
Visions in my mind bein increased by inner beef
And some grief, but when I chief on some strong leaf
I'm snappin hard enough to make a nigga try to check his own chief
Violate him but can't annihilate him
Pickin' up his own teeth and it's on with the microphone deep
Stimulate him with pistols penetrate him
Nerves still droppin' cause adrenaline pumpin is a m'uhfucker
Hit him with the steel bloodsuckers
Murdered the bud, and I was makin' sure
Every one of you hoe studs suck us
And I bullshit you not if it was full clips, two glocks
You would still die or you'll get too hot
'Cause when my fuel kick you'll drop
Hypes is trickin on you
Tell me where he at bitch and you'll get two rocks
(Okay!) 'Cause when my tool click you'll pop
Can't have this hype nigga stop shit, I'm hazardous
Makin' musical miracles like I'm Jesus of Nazerath
Yet disastrous, smokin' on half and hash, fuck if it's cancerous
Bust ass (??) 'cause I mastered this
It's hard to breathe, I'm bustin' like an A-bomb
'Cause I'm in the zone, twenty-two a cold shit up my sleeve
It's hard to stay calm
Thinkin' about the bitches that I've been up on
Hittin my enemies and competition up with lethal rolls
That's damagin, flows that's callous and we're leavin'
Thick ladies frantic and people in the industry panickin
I thought we got in this to get out of pistol handlin
Now it's possible m'uhfuckers could start vanishin
Fuck the Anacin I be toking plenty of stanky for stress
And flowin over notes; them studs thinkin' they can get close
I know I got you trippin' off the shit
A nigga said off a overdose
(Twista)
C'mon and toke on a dub with me; I love cities with parties
That's full of bitches where they let me rub titties
Be able to pack a snub with me; in case we get in some static
And gotta start leakin blood from stud skinnies
So don't ask if it's the bud in me; because for some reason
I smoke on some weed and get too wicked and raw
It can't be nickel or somethin', way it's chokin me
Potency'll have me rockin' mics
And givin' your bitch dick in the jaw, I'm hookin the law
You're lookin' in awe, took what you saw
Got the B's pen and pad out the bottom drawer
Then got to bitin and formulatin some shit you called your own
But take it to the rehab cause you got a flaw
To put it simple you ain't cold enough
Trippin' out like you can't control the stuff
Lackin rhythm like you known to bust
In a different zone from us
You niggas need to sit the fuck down
Get a swisher and roll this up
If you think I'm speakin' too bold, whassup?
I ain't even on no hoe shit; plus the mob is so thick
I'm the type of nigga you should wanna get up close to
And take a smoke with
If there's static then check yo' clique; my mind is so sick
I be tweakin with speakin' releasin energy to show I know the ropes
'Cause when it comes to this rap shit
Niggas will choke till I'm ghost
While I breath reefer smoke from my overdose
Try to put me to the test, gimme some budda bless
I'll show you who the best
Release the vocal trilogy...
Traxter Aight T god damn slow it up mayn! M'uhfuckers done felt you mayn!
We can go on to some next shit
Twista God damn man you stoppin' motherfuckers and shit

You looking chilliy wit yo thick ass
I know you got plenty niggas out there who trick cash
I damn near caught whiplash as you walked pass
Fucked up the blunt ashes
Peepin your script perpetrating you high
Youz a rat in disguise I see the freak in you eyes
You got between your thighs from fuckin' to many guys
And yet still you play the sweet role but we know
That you juggle dicks like slot machines at a casino
I'm high as hell so I'm flaotin
Up in the party tokin
A 44 max and nigga don't jack
'Cause I blast away fuck up a niggas whole day
Get the wildin and shoot this btich up in the party
Mobsta style you ain't had a thug in a while
I hit her wit the proposition as she's peepin me out
So what's the lick shorty? Fuck the game me or the lane
She hoped in the Range and then her attitude changed
She said ""I know you fool you one of them Mobsta niggas""
""Who rap wit Twista, where's he at"" fired up wit some liquor
Hold tight shorty we almost at the City Inn
I told Maze about the lick soon as he buzzed me in
Baby if you want to party tonight
Then let me see you touch your toes
And show me you a party hoe
I got my niggas you got your girls
Cause bitch we fucked the world and how do we hurl
Only if you partying hoe
(Maze)
I gotta confess I think I'm obsessed wit group sex
Yo lets have a contest and see who do it the best
Inside of Nubian flesh make me wanna get undressed
Tap that ass from the back cause baby your bodies blessed
And your friend to she bend too
Bust out some ginseng brew so I can dick your whole crew
That's the shit I'm into pass some pussy to my guys
Put my dick in your mouth shoot the loogy in your eye
I don't wanna socialize I'm just trying to get bucked
So after you get fucked you hoes gotta raise up
Bumpin out just blaze up big ol' B and the T's
Kick off the party wit you and your homies or your knees
While y'all party to see who got the most superb herb
Nigga Stokes gonna stroke that ass wit the killa curb
Till sober and then do it over again
Cause who ever taste the most dick is the one to win
So open them thighs wide while a nigga slide in
Let me see how many different ways your body can bend
Trippin' on Liff spinnin your girl like he gonna miss her
While I'm opening the door for my niggaro Twista

(Twista)
Would you mind if I take your thongs off with my teeth
In the middle of the sheets I'm a freak with some whipped cream and a peach
Would you mind if I snatched you straight up out the club to the dubs
Running dubs to the tubs, to the bedroom, to the couch, to the rug
Now would you mind if I beat it up on a sink in the kitchen
Or watch the flash screen on the wall flicking high definition
Now would you, mind not the chicken alfredo and champagne
If I go back to spanking that thang why you give me good brain, c'mon
(Mecca Soul)
It's two a.m., just left the bar
Pull up to the front valet my car
Roll up an ounce on my platinum car
C-note, the bell I'm superstar
Who serve this champagne and cham'
31 floors let me get that hip
Six inch heels, sexy thong
Gucci dressed, now take that off
Would you mind, mind, it's the penthouse suite
Room full of fiends that thug at parties
Would you mind, mind, get on the tour bus
She ain't with you she leaving with us
Would you mind, mind, it's going down
Take your girl and then turn her out
And the night is mine, the panties strapped
The remix hot, and it don't stop
(Mecca Soul)
Look at you shorty do your thing
Look at you on the TV screen
Look at you shorty you's a freak
Look at you on top of me
In and out, and up and down
Soft and rough around and round
Jacuzzi, pat-i-o
Shower, bed, want floor
Dance to the cha-cha for me ma-ma
Shake it make it drop drop for your pa-pa
Twist your hips and your na-na, get hot
Bounce, them ta-ta's, don't stop
(Toxic)
Open the door come in, Toxic these whore again
From the penthouse to the spas been in
She said pour me some gin and where the weed at
But all you gone get is a fin and catch a cab when I get a ski back
Now see that, you trying to sip the whole bottle
But gin ain't the only thing you and your friend gone swallow
You ain't no model so how you gone trip
No ass, how you gone sit, shit I'm bout to dip
(Mecca Soul)
The party's over, we at the penthouse
Eighteen and older, come to the penthouse
Man thug gone show out, reefer gone flow out
Get drunk and roll out, get some get throwed out
Down here, in low-low's, come to the penthouse
You and your grown folks, we in the penthouse
To all my groupies, with big old booties
We making movies, in the penthouse suite

I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time
Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line
(Repeat)
Play with mine you'll find that it's the wrong damn move
I was the wrong damn dude
Gino told me do the usual leave him in critical
My brother Bruce told me that he didn't pay dues
You snooze and lose
So what I'd do is make this man take a bath in his shoes
And it was all on the news
See I knew that it would be that me or him gonna bleed
And it wasn't gonna be me
So what I did was popped one up in my chamber and I sent 3
No women no kids
And I'ma shine on this nigga like Mop 'N Glo
You think he stopped and load
He jumped down with the rocks and a bomb on a dope
But he didn't have to be so bold
He rushed the Mob like a blob with the glocks and more
And even called the cops on Sko
He be shitty chi with the diamond in the watch in the coat
The medallion to match with the rope
No cars and the trucks in the cars that he ride
Lookin' like a star when he glide
I swear to God when he hear the bullet fall through the sky
He be jackin' like a rabbit tryin' to hide
Kinda hard to catch a nigga who be gone in the wind
Purple Navigator and a Benz
A new ??, the old niggaz that he used to fuck with
Took a fall for strength of a man
(Sko get it) before I step outside and do my job for Allah
Pray to Allah, undo Allah
Anythang go wrong I pray to Allah
Anythang go right I give my praise to Allah
Anythang in sight I'ma bless for Allah
Everythang tonight I'ma test for Allah
Everythang you write I'ma erase yo bar
If you ridin' tonight you better hop out yo car
Cause the moon tonight is traced in 5-star
I feel for ? my sisters at the bar
Y'all be aight just keep yo self to yo self
Y'all can see aight out on the streets it's double dare
Over there it's the end of the road East 99 find my kind
Still blind to the times and the signs
On the streets niggaz killin' elites
Killin' ??
Killin' the chief
5 stars in the governor
Everybody gettin' covered up
Wrapped up in some bloody sheets
I came off the deep saw throw my heart
Niggaz slangin' a V with the L's on his way all the time
Since I'm dyin' then I'd rather go right now
Than to be waitin' in line
I can't seem to get away from all the things in the world that bring me down
And I can't seem to get away from all the pressures
And the pain that I find myself around
But I need a little more time for me to survive
All the dirty things that I did in my life
I can walk by I can try to crawl by I can run
But I cannot hide from my piece of mind
I hit him clean in the middle of his dentures
He was getting carried away because I let him slide
A couple times he went off on an adventure
Bloody murderer only to die it the Darkside
And god I like to for killin' over some Benjamins
But it wasn't about my money it was bout his pride
He had to run to the van he was defending it
In a line of duty he died for a piece of mind
I never knew I would have to murder the motherfucker
I was the one fighting and piecing and increasing the peace
I could (?) hit me and my brother
We was the reason for a record that CD release
We B.I.B. to the avenue about the trigger time
You can't be alive in the hood when we dirt ride
And motherfuckers got down cause never could
Never survive with the goods that god provide
So as I bogus wack him for doing my job
Eliminate niggas that hate 'cause they ruining the mob
I choose got bruise when I toss that guy out in the squad
While they flossing the cars we busting and turn into god"

Yeah... no introduction is really needed
But it's, the Bishop Don Magic Juan
Chairman of the Board, of famous playas everywhere!
Playas, playas, playas!
Representin, green is for the money
Gold is for the honey, ain't it man?
Pimp pimp onnnn, pimp-pimp onnnn
Pimp onnnn, pimp pimp on!
Then get your pimp on
(Verse One: Twista)
Peep how the Twist' puttin' down the luchie while smokin' a lot of dro
Whatchu know 'bout checkin' yo' paper for a down-ass bottom hoe
Or snatchin yo' new fur model mink with the hood off the hanger
24-karat rings standin a half a foot off the finger
Custom seats are amazin tellin' nobody could touch that bitch
Shoes my Maurie, piss by the month, he cut shock shit
Anything from my hoes when I ask, I get it
In the Cadillac I kick it, since y'all I wanted to be like macks and Bishop
Type wanna get up in the club, drinkin' Cris'sy from a gold cup
Flossin my club, peepin persons yellin' out ""Chuuuch!""
Finna attract to trick politicians I'ma maintain pimpin'
You can't change pimpin', from the Stone Age to the ""Space Age"" pimpin'
From Southern mackin in Memphis to the playa mo' when you shoot to Chi
In the black diamond with fuchsia dye pullin out hoes like Supafly
All I gotta do is spit fo' lines
Now she got me chameleon gators with colors that flip fo' times
Now get yo'.
Pimp pimp onnnn (pimp on)
Pimp-pimp onnnn (pimp on)
Pimp onnnn (pimp on) pimp pimp on!
Then get your pimp on
Pimp pimp onnnn (and if you want it the 'Llac with three hoes in the back)
Pimp-pimp onnnn (feelin' like a mack while you checkin' yo' scratch)
Pimp onnnn (then you gettin' yo' pimp on) pimp pimp on!
Then get your pimp on
(Verse Two: 8 Ball)
Uh... yeah... yeah, yeah
It's the fat, mack - EightBall to most of y'all
You a hoe need a pimp, I'm the one you supposed to call
Shit talker, somebody's daughter she my street walker
She call me daddy, she a hoe so that's what I call her
Or big toed, hard-head ass hoe
The rougher I treat her she love a nigga even mo'
Brush my hair, manicure and do my toes
Knock bitches from them niggaz who act like hoes
I'm mink draggin out my 2-2 Paddywagon
Sittin' on 2-3's, diamonds on 24 karats
Ball not a bitch ass, and I don't make deals
Peel a meal from a pussy, know how that feels?
High heels and furs, Lexus his and hers
Hpnotic, ex' and sex mixed with the words
Pull up, and let the window down, here she come
The American way, I was taught how to.
(Verse Three: Too $hort)
Playa getcha pimpin' on
Gotta getcha game together man, all your women gone
To start all over, ain't nothin' to a mack
Just put 'em to work, and watch yo' money stack
That's fo'sho' doe, everyday a G a mo'
Asked your little sister, ""Girl, why you wanna be a hoe?""
She got turned out, like Red Riding Hood
Goin' to Grandma's house, now she lookin' real good
While the Big Bad Wolf tryna eat her out
Pay up, the cash is what we be about
Squares, we don't care if you don't understand
Players break out the game power, you don't wanna go there
Say it in your prayers you wanna be like me
You down on your knees but it's not likely
To ever happen, so I just keep rappin'
This real mackin, this ain't actin'

124,Pray for Me,2001,Legit Ballin' 2: New Testament 2K (2001),Midwest Rap,Twista,"(Feat. Todd Nitty)
(Todd Nitty)
Here's the tale of a young black male
Raised in these city streets
Out here hustling to make ends meet
In a world that's so corrupt
That's ran by greed
Money and the power
For me I'm a survivor
I do what I have to and only God can judge me for that
So before you cash your stones down on me
I want you to take a look at yourself in the mirror
And ask somebody to pray for you
Cause that's all I'm asking is to pray for me, understand
I was born around gangstas, hustlers, and killers
Drug dealers with math figures making hella scrilla
In the city of Chi the home of the G's
If ya don't work ya don't eat that's been the code of the streets
As for me I was brought up at an early age
Learned how to cook cane started to gang bang
And it's a damn shame I chose game
But see I'ma knuckle headed nigga with no one to blame
And I'ma gonna keep on tipping under the street lights
And be wondering which nigga wanna take my life
Until then I'm staying two feet in front of you haters
I'm living the street life
And I just can't get away
I don't know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
So everynight I pray
Oh I pray
I'm living the street life
And I just can't get away
I don't know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
So everynight I pray
Well I'm surrounded by rats, roaches, and dope fiends
My whole world is being weighed up on a triple beam
Man I don't know what's in store for me god
Will I reach 21
Why is life so damn hard
See that's the question that's asked
And is there a heaven or hell can the young black live
Or will he be chained in the cell
I don't know as for me I only trusted a few
I had to hustle to survive now what else could I do
They say there's chances for everybody that's bullshit
That little girl had no chance when that bullet hit
I mean it blew to the sky
And all you heard was a cry
Oh lord don't let my baby die
Till the day that I die I'll stay true to my neighborhood
Fuck with my neighborhood nigga I wish you would
Ain't shit changed like oh once said
And oh no fool my nigga Fred ain't dead
Neither is Pook or Kansas City
True og's still here with me
My homie boo, boo what up
And you know I can't forget about my nigga, nigga Novesnake
Nightime boats and herbie
Shine and Cherelle would ya pray for me
I rock genue death so dam sensless
Big houses what the fucking radio been missing
And there's one more nigga that be true to my heart
Mr. Motion you the reason while I'm breaking 'em off
So our
I peed 'em to dead
Whole reason was love
To that nigga twist for believing in me
I got a shorty to feed
My priority is to make sure this shit don't have to struggle like me
And if I could ask for one more wish
I tell 'em I wanna hug ya 'cause I'm missing ya since
So I'm asking to pray for me
Mamma pray for me
Daddy pray for me
Baby pray for me
Please pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me"

Ratatattat
Ratatattat
What's the sound of a gat
Ratatattat
What's the sound of a gat
Ratatattat
What's the sound of a gat
Ratatattat
Show 'em how the Tung smacks

Show 'em how the Tung smacks
Ratatattat
Show 'em how the Tung smacks
Ratatattat
Prr-prrrr... buck 'em down
Sucker ducks, comin' to pluck 'em down
Hope the hip hype hip-hop horn struck 'em down
Climbin, I'm never rhymin Simple like Simon but I'ma do what Simon said
He told me to put that head to bed
Givin' an eyeful, funky rhythm of a tongue will stifle
Trifle 'cause I pop the tongue like a rifle
Watch the funky words pounce
From my mouth watch 40 bounce
Cappin a sucker duck like a 40 ounce
Some flows are wack, but as for me I cause a catastrophe
Like callin Allah God steppin to me is blasphemy
I shoot the tongue like a machine gun
Know what I mean, son?
A chunky spunky tongue if you ever seen one
Cops, I give 'em props, they cap men, mostly black men
Mouth will pack, then smack 'em like a Mack-10
Bop - another head flown like a frisbee, it is me
The clips from my lips could drop a Grizzly
Hear me vick, I pack a kick for the ballistic, animalistic
You didn't know my tongue was this quick
Cops that be cappin thinkin' that be spunky
Watch I hit them with the lyric and then I'm cut 'em up with a funky
Ratatattat
Poppin' and poppin' and poppin' the flow of the hip hype hop rhythm
I bust caps like I've been hittin false teeth with raps
Rip your show apart, I know you got no heart to start, I flow art
I got the style that even Humphrey couldn't Bogart
Syllable serum, suckers hear come a style to smack a man
And it be sort of like a smack of Jackie Chan
I pop the funky gun of hip hop, I hop with hips
Droppin' battle ships I put the automatic clips up into my lips
Funky like a drunk, I buck 'em like a hunter
My rifle will make 'em stifle like Edith Bunker
Suckers I tag em, my rhythm'll rag em, drag em
They felt the funky flow of the formula .44 Magnum
Minimum against the maximum, cracks a maximus
Charge tax and dust, thinkin' about waxin us
DJ Jihad will slice 'em like lard
Check out the funky cut, rocks god be gunnin 'em up like buckshots
Cappin a brother if he come in a centimeter
Comin' to drop the style of Tung and then I bet I'm gonna beat ya
Shootin like mi Uzi, I re-arrange a fella feature
Filimeter, mi funky rhythm is like a 9 millimeter
Ratatattat"
127,Razzamatazz / Jazzamatazz,1992,Runnin' off at da Mouth (1992),Midwest Rap,Twista,"Oh - back again makin' the rhythm kick jazz
Used to be wick-wack, now I got funky pizzazz
Idryss'll do my fade-up 'cause he cuts 'em like class
And the chicks want me to lick 'cause I'm too quick, I think I'll pass
Dollars, if I don't fold em, I roll 'em like a bolo
Other steppin to brothers 'cause he be God? Oh no
G-o-d, I be not he, it's true, don't call me loco
And my man Eric the Wiz will stir the mini mix up like Coco
Cut like Michael Myers, start up fires, I'm a scar hard
Thinkin' I be wimpy, I just simply rip 'em far apart
Ansaars in New York, I know that you know that you are God
This brother's from Chicago, so I guess I'm a Chigagod
Rhythm is my producer of rhythms on the wax
The posse Lower Level be kickin some funky tracks
Never ask, I ax, I get madder than Max
Diggem smacks, if they try to tax I play 'em like a sax
Rock - me call it what?
(Razzamatazz)
Rock - me call it what?
(Jazzamatazz)
Styles, I hand em, I brand 'em like cattlecakes
Better get flows from your bros if a battle takes
I hear a hiss, the tale of a taddle shakes
Backs this breaks givin' aches to the rattlesnakes
I get spunky with funky stylin
Rhythms I flow, I kick them wild and
Tryin' to get with the styles I'm pilin
For your sob story I better get the violin
Come again - watch a fun one construct
I don't like sissy chickens and I hate a sucker duck
Some label me a sucker because ducks I like t pluck
The only way I be a sucker is if women wanna suck
Always goin' broke so I don't dig into my stash
I'm cool as Brian Robbins on the show _Head of the Class_
If you don't get the picture, make the camera go flash
When this rhythm was a baby, doc spanked him on his - jaz
Study my culture, soar like a vulture
My teacher Marvin Howard will create my sculpture
I'm kickin Islam, some brothers try to bomb
Facts can harm but I still say Salaam
Sometimes I blush, bust and leave puss
Hush if I must, plus I don't forget to flush
With suckers I fuss, thought I was soft like a slush
Chicagods crush 'cause they think toys r us
Hip (hip what) hop
This funky hip (hip what) hop
Is funky hip (hip what) hop
This funky hip (hip what) hop
'Ll make a drip (drip what) drop
I like to rip (rip what) shop
I always slip (slip what) cops
Reachin' the tip (tip what) top
Come in again
Buck-buck, my rhythm be knockin' at the do'
Mi stamina rock, mi stamina rock, bloodclot, I do not know
Why they judge me by one rap and say too fast I flow
Even though I kinda thought I said it slow - oh"

Ain't no give and take nigga I'm taking no giving
It's a wild ass ride sometime I hate that I'm living

Keep my mind on this money cause a bitch got to stay flicking

Get down to the club
Chokin' on sticky and everything was loved, oh yeah
Look here now
Then on came the lights, hey
All the niggas and bitches in the party was feelin' high
Liffy Stokes bring it
(Liffy Stokes)
Tonight's gon' be the bomb, it's warm and calm
I got to take this cool in my arm with an ounce in my palm
I done took the bottle with Don, and I'm back for sure
Actin' a fool, gettin' skully, mixin' henny and mo
With plenty to draw, and we gotta blaze by the door
With too much M to the O from rushin' the dance floor
Mob style runnin' wild through every section and aisle
Drinkin' River, pissy now, collectin' numbers to dial
Talkin' loud, flash the cheese just for the haters and keys
That try to catch me sooner so they can cease without the cheese
Through mobstability, y'all be killin' me
With that weak shit, a nigga just came to party
With my guys and women probably pitchin' couple of innings
Break 'em down through my winnings and come out to drink winnin'
With my paper and ladies on the E doin' about eighty
Tryin' to get to the (?) so that freaky bitch can lay me
When the mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
'Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with
The mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
'Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with
(Mayz)
I'm bendin' curves through the gym straight smokin' and drinkin'
Westside, mob style, and the mink and the lickin'
Trippin' on the cutie that's winkin'
'Cause she know we got the shit that rocks her block
And put the boom in your box and make your speakers pop
So I take this as my cue to make sure shorty don't snooze
The mobsta's rockin' tonight at the House of Blues
With some mo and some crews and now she lookin' in dues
Talkin' about bringin' our homies and puttin' on dancin' shoes
It's like that y'all, let your paper stack tall
So when you hit the club you can ball and get some numbers to call
Don't worry about the playa haters leanin' on the wall
Because when they get the gold and start to ball
They gonna have to fight us all to the end
Playas get a glass and a set of twins
In different clothes so they can be a thug's extend
'Cause when this party ends another begins it don't stop
So flash your knot and beep me at my guy's red shop
(Twista)
Hey hey, oh suki-suki now, look here now, what's cookin' now
Shook it shook it, child, shake it down, let's boogie now
From the hood and I be the chief, feelin' good as taters and waiters
With playas with the ladies pullin' up in big-ridin' Mercedes
This party gon' fade me, smokin' with the brokes and the brothers
Cherry gators, yo dawg, this pocket's full hundreds and rollers
I'm kickin' it out with tippin' dippin' off from the laws
In the glance of an eye with drawers, while they hustlin' just to ball
(?) So I bought a drink, sport a link, recall the mink
Hoe figure she was pretty and think maybe I ought to wink
And she takes a glance, party'a boomin' so maybe I got a chance
This cutie got too much booty and I asked her to dance
Flippin' 50s in my hand, champagne all up in my face
Takin' pictures, (?) close 'em all bitches' probably in the place
Straight po pimpin', I'm trippin' (?) it's the weekend
Steady quickin', take a pimpin' and pay the scraps for sneakin'
'Cause when the...

Throw it up, are you a true money maker
Throw it up, 'cause you a big time playa

When blue and white's come, what you gon' do - RUN
If you can't get away then stash the gun
Before you get popped off, have some fun

9 times outta 10, you escape when you run
But if you can't get away then toss the gun

You'll be livin' in county hell
Niggaz in the bullpen'll erase yo block
Muthafuckin' Ricans done stole yo car
You wanna see this type of shit - NO
You wanna go this type of place - NO
All bullshit aside nigga jail ain't fun
Especially when you can't make yo bail and run
Sittin' in the D-A room talkin' about appeal
They ain't tryin' to hear that shit, be for real

They knew every place that you hid the dough
So you the muthafucka that wasn't on post

Served too slow when PIG's in the hole
If you knew you had a ??
Why the fuck you act like ice and froze
What was you thinkin' when you sold that crown
You coulda been bout three blocks down
Hittin' gates and gateways and all that
Kept all the cash, the yay, and the gat
Took you a break, woulda smoked you a blunt
Came back out and shot back up
C'mon, c'mon, and RUN

Leave the gateway open so I can dip through the back
Smokin' ?? they got in a pack
Tippin' from all the hypes that's pullin' up on bikes
What the hell am I doin' out here servin' with two strikes
Niggaz don't know I'm trainin' to be a track star
(Whoop, Whoop - Errrrr!) Put yo hands on the car
You must be one of them tight big niggaz that's old
But I'm from the bigger number with the rhythm and roll
I hit blocks, dip cops
Kept the knot, dropped the glock, ended up on Wilcox
It don't even matter now 'cause I done throwed them rocks
Went through a house that I don't know like I was Goldie Locks
I broke a sweat
Now I'm smokin' dro in a Lac
I'm throwin' a pack
Shit, I ain't never goin' back
If I happen to go to jail, niggaz better tryin'
I make a getaway cleverly and never see time 'cause I'll RUN"

Loadin, explodin, causin harm, poppin' and droppin' a bomb
Breakin it down like Imaam, so be calm, cause see, I'm
The capable, no mistakable, makin' the unbreakable breakable
Able to hook 'em like cable cause Sinister Def ain't stable
No deceivin and weavin a web, I be leavin' a stain in your brain and bustin' your vein
Pickin' and kickin a style I be lickin' and shakin and bakin and makin' it rain
Simple and plain, I smoke 'em like hickory dickory dock, it's time to clock
So brothers I mop, the bigger they drop, so stop, Tung Twista, pop
(Tung Twista)
Gotta be that it be lyrical hip-hop
Rockin' a rhythm, I never stop-drop, I'm gonna give 'em a pop
Flowin this up and breakin the suckers up off of the mic and then rip it to shreds
I be kickin and makin' the people come off in a rage
And my lyrical magic I'm makin' and movin, I label this funky
Oh, this dope rhythm I throw be pump-pump-pumpin 'em up in the mind
And be bringin' 'em up into hypeness
This funky tempo I throw, I know that I be slappin the dope hypeness up in em
And then I'ma bend 'em a lyrical rhythm
I throw with the tongue, be leavin' 'em hung among
This style I be throwin' to tangle the mind of a sucker
Then label it lyricalism
And scopin 'em in a prism
And givin' a lyrical flow that will fizz em
I tackle a rhythm and break it up, only my lyric was left
My Tung Twista is def first, let me take a deep breath
Flowin the lyrical magic of mine I be moppin and sweepin
And breakin 'em up and then makin' 'em break in a sweat
I be makin' 'em jump and then sit up and lift the style
I be kickin and poppin' the rhythm I'm rockin' and pumpin
The lyrics I put up inside 'em be makin' 'em rock
And a flow of the rhythm I'm bringin' into the mic
I'm gonna give 'em a concept, never let a con step
To what I be givin' the crowd that be makin' 'em hype and then leavin' a con swept
Breakin the suckers up into chunks, I be leavin' 'em sinkin deeper than south
I'm gonna twist this up funky, T.T. be runnin' off at the mouth
(Indeed)
Run off, run off, run off, run off at the mouth
(Sinister Def)
Listen to the tongue twist, twistin is the Tung
Because of my trickery my tongue is slippery
This style is wild I brung
Terrible, tragical, mystical, magical, wreck in a second
The ladies I'm checkin' and trickin
You think that I'm sickenin, hoes be kickin when I stick it in
I got the enemy jumpin' like Jimny like it was ten of me
Try to be friend of me, suckin my simile
If I'm ill, then give me the rememdy
I'm bakin like Daxon, waxin, givin' 'em facts just like a lawyer
Cause Sinister Def be runnin' off at the mouth like Latoya
B-b-buck 'em down, see, buck 'em down

Lyrical wiz, never a wanna-be, gonna be rippin 'em up into particles
Then I'ma come in the pitiful puppet's mind
Seekin' a rhythm and you shall find
Me rockin' the funk of the rhythm, me stamina crammin 'em up in a t line
Be devine, me lyrical purrrrfection, a funky feline
Cappin a crowd with a mic and then makin' 'em mangle

And if you never come into cheer me, I say cheerio, hero
Me rhythm will float like a boat, let's see how he flow
My freedom of speech I'm a reach up against your lyrical flowin, a styler

Intro, I break a, break a brother ten fold
Oh, 10-40, stomp 'em like a dinosaur
Poor excuse for an MC, so-so singers
The things I bring'll snap like fingers
Rugged hip-hop, I'm gettin' funky like a cheap perfume
Doom, take 'em from the womb to the tomb, whom
It may concern, I return from the mentally dead
To fly a sleep sucker duck's head
A thouroughbred in this talent, I be snappin like I'm coo-coo
Try to fade my spade, you made a boo boo
Suckers say 'ooops', troops, I spank 'em if they rap happy
Never calm, 'cause I'm snap happy
Am I snap happy? (mh-hm)
Tell me am I snap happpy? (mh-hm)
Tell me am I snap happpy? (mh-hm)
Yo, tell me am I snap happpy? (mh-hm)
(VERSE 2: Tung Twista)
Snap happy - snappin on those who think I rap crappy
The Tung is snappy, rougher than nappy, you can't outrap me
Punk, with suckers I toy, I'm stronger than a droid
I don't avoid the noid, I destroyed the noid
So I gotta make a scrub pay hay
Suckers I slay, they lay stinkin in the subway
Focus, my rhythm will scrub, say rub-a-dub-dub
'Cause I'ma step into 'em like a bathtub
I make 'em run like waterfalls, use your eyes for pool balls
Then run through rappers like school halls
I'm breakin sucker punks' backs
Facts on wax, when I step, instead of footprints, I leave tire tracks
My rhythm be delicious while
I flow, the skunk of this, funk of this with a dramatically vicious style
I destroy your phoney hip-hopness like the Lochness
Monster, just because I want ta
1 to 2, I'm comin' through
Swig 'em like a brew, ooh
You think I bit off more than I can chew?
I break a sissy up with no twist
Don't make my tongue flappy
I still can be labelled as snap happy
DJ Jihad get loose
(DJ scratches) (Hit me)
(VERSE 3: Tung Twista)
I snap and make 'em yield
Spin my tongue like a windmill
And crack your skull like a windshield
Show me where a sucker makes a error, I give him terror
Be smooth as Aloe Vera, they run like mascara
I turn 'em over like a page, engage
I eat 'em with rage and trap the duck behind my rib cage
Flow, my jock'll make 'em blow
Want me to take 'em slow
I flow speed till they can't take no mo'
Get the urge to see what I'm servin', bee
I make an emergency for the sucker to get surgery, word to G
You thinkin' what I said'll miss
But I'm the head of this, what I said'll diss
'Cause it's a mega-diss
If you sleep get into bed of this
But if you wake up, I'ma fly that dreaded head like Pegasus
I'm a son, but for some reason they wanna call me the rap pappy
I guess it's 'cause I'm snappy

I can do shit to you that'll make you shake in lust
Comin' through how I be stoppin' off, kinky when I make you cum
How could you wanna do shit that'll make me break the trust?
Shoulda knew you were sheisty the way you lick me on my body
And actin' shady when I'm out the crib, lightly
Cause somethin' bogus just to fight me spite me all in my area
Plus I'm a Sagittarius, you a Pisces
For some reason we be clickin like we on business
But you be on some bullshit
Askin me where I go, what I do, how I kick it
Won't you get with it baby girl, I don't cheat on you and pull shizz
Now who don't wanna roll on, chrome with then go home with
Get you to the crib, give you some grown dick
I let you hold my pounds down, purchasin you phones and fits
How many times I told you, I ain't known shit
But you steady don't listen even though it's your friends that listen
Gotta have trust, but you won't back up on a couple I'll catch you wishin
Claimin that I'm fuckin' on another bitch and
All in my privacy on no preminition, you trippin'
Tell me why do you - doubt a brother, in one ear and out the other
Cause in my shirt you done found number
You steady lurkin while I was up in the shower
Dumpin all of my pants pockets, trippin' cause you done found a rubber
And all I gotta say is.

I'm grown - baby let me know, and then I'll let you know
'Cause I'm the one that's footin the bills
And I'm not the wrong one, that's for real
You can get your shit and go, gooooo!

Now you don't see me all up in your dresser drawers
You don't see me goin' through your Jag
You don't see me in your cell; you don't see me
Searchin through your thongs, and you don't see me though your Gucci bag
Baby you got the shabazz; sometimes you need a swift, kick up the ass
Just to to see how far a foot can go
Would you wash it and took it slow, couldn't though
Pressure cookin low, bitch I hope you find what you lookin' fo'
I'm losin focus from fuckin' witchu, don't get me charged
Come in from a show, my whole closet be picked apart
If anybody should be paranoid in this motherfucker it should be me
I'm the one smokin' hydro by the jars
You need to leave my stuff alone, go and get some business of your own
Cause me and you ain't spendin precious time together
Baby don't touch mine, I shouldn't need a ""don't touch"" sign
I ain't explainin nothin', you can find whatever
And all I gotta say is.

Now when I get up in your ooh-watcha-katcha
Move to the mm-ch-ka mm-ch-ka mm-ah, don't lie
You peepin the details of my fax, mail and voice mail
And E-mail and why sugar, don't try
To come up with the justification for what you doin'
The relationship's about to be ruined for what you persuin
Steadily tryna see who I'm screwin like I'm fuckin' the nation
It's nothin' but hatin' that the homies be doin'
Spittin' rumors all up in your ear, tension in the atmosphere
Baby what's the mission here, listen here
You lookin' for numbers and fist in hair
It must be here for a reason so quit before I have to make you disappear
I can do without you pokin through pockets
Prophecy's potent, whatchu peepin fo'?

Shoulda told you when I thought about it a week ago
But now I'm tellin' you.

Lookin' finer than a girl that be groovin on Soul Train
I try to to hit her with some cold game
I hope she - feel me; try to holla at a shorty
Get a better vibe wit her while I'm sippin on my - Henny
I wanna kiss her on her body
But I gotta make her holla while I'm givin' her - the D
Gotta really love a girl
They know to kick it but she know she gotta make that - money
Goin' shoppin' for the minks and the leather
But come back and bounce that ass - for me
My East coast girls, that's what's up
Tell my Southside shorties we can get it crunk
My Cali girl make it bounce like a six-fo'
My Chi girl bust down, make it straight buck
When I see up all the girls that get down for hers
I gotta get up wit her if she gon' let me
Career woman with some goals, fuck the broke-ass hoes
Baby girl cause you look so sexy"

That the crew came down on to me
Y'all took my brother from me
So now open up your books
And turn your pages to ?live you well?
12-12, and it reads ""You are now entering
The gates of hell, all cause of betrayal
Y'all took my brother from me, it's war time
Y'all dying, cause the ? is mine""
(Darkside Ballaz: Sko)
I'm feeling neglected, disrespected niggas don't appreciate my effort
That I, put forward, so I'm bringing forth war
Make 'em respect me, who the fuck wanna catch me when I'm speed
Looking at niggas hit the ground and bleed, who the fuck leave
Nigga, eat, sleep, now my heart's full of grief
Y'all put us six feet, you bitches killed the chief
He said, you don't know who did it bitch, you lying through your teeth
You said you running with it bitch, he got killed on the D
Get 'em all, till them all fall, kill 'em all, for betraying me
Get 'em all, till them all fall, kill 'em all, for betraying me
Get 'em all, till them all fall, kill 'em all, for betraying me
Darkside love, eternally, now my thoughts of insanity
My heart beat, dirt concrete, I couldn't see
Couldn't, couldn't sleep, couldn't breathe my soul on me
Fell to my knees and ask the lord to breathe
Through my brother's lungs when I heard he got pumped with them slugs
(Chorus: Oobie)
Somebody got to die
Now I don't wanna take his life
But when I see my homie died
I knew somebody had to pay the price
It hurts to see mama cry
But I got to make a sacrifice, yeah yeah
See two wrongs don't make it right
So forgive me this night, somebody got to die
(Darkside Ballaz: Lo)
Should not of even took the dime out the bottle
Still Lord, over there on Wallow
Them niggas came with big shit
And took my cousin life real quick
They ain't give a fuck, them niggas had they pistols buck
I heard when Lyn hit the ground they kept on hitting him up
The only thing on his mind was trying to get away
Hoping the law had something good or score for him that day
But since he didn't, I guess it was time for him to leave this world
He always said he wanted to die while he was breathing yeah
We had our mind on shooting that video that early morn
Now not before we got the chance that living be gone
We don't need to know who hit you and took your life away
But one day we gone get them niggas and make sure life be straight
Everyday I think about you, and I just cry, picture you face
In the clouds, cause down here it ain't that same without you
You was the realest nigga, I know you feel this nigga
And it turned your brother to a killa they hurt my feelings nigga
And when we go and get em, I do the honors
'Cause they done heard my eighteen ladies, Sky, Tre and Ladona
We wasn't ever the type to take nobody life, but they
Took yours, so now they got to die, Lord he didn't deserve it

Man, thangs ain't the same since I lost my sense
Now I'm on some, kill 'em all, fuck 'em all, straight murder and shit
Drinking, fifths and hennessy to ease the pain
I can't maintain, sometimes I think I'm going insane
As I, look into my mama eyes, and all she tell me
Is, why oh why did her baby have to die
So I'm, bout to slip that clip in, 'cause I'm all about revenge
And catch you slipping and do his monkey ass in
Nigga what the fuck you thought, I wasn't gone break you off
Make somebody to get you touched, nigga you got your life fucked up

Blast, his hoe ass and get my dash on
And not, bout to let it ride

This goes out to all sides worldwide
Let that playa ass nigga Twista be yo guide, as we go on a ride
Hood to hood, chrome, leather, and wood
And it feels so good...
(Twista)
One mornin' I...
Woke up next to a peanut butter and a caramel chick
Feelin' fucked up, flicked out, freaked on
Thinkin' about my new truck with tha' deep dish
Meanin' deep chrome, deep chrome, in the deep dome
After a massage and a ménage, we got in the shower
Let water trickle down the crack of the back of they booty
Got out the tub and went back to the master bedroom
One put on prada, one put on Ludi, I put on gucci
Duty calls, I'm bout to hit the scene and ball
But before I leave I spray on some Itsimiaki
Take my truck up to the wash, put the sparkle back on
Wax on, wax off like Mr. Miyagi
Go to the liquor store so I can get blunts, get Yak
So I can sip some while I split one
Chronicle enter ever pholical of my body
Calmin' down every molecule, makin' sure I don't trip none
Hit one...
Hop in tha' ride, come and kick it wit me
So I can take you through tha' so-and-so hundred block
And show you how my people be kickin' it in the windy city
I wanna show you where I hang out at, where we make our scratch
While we sit on leather grippin' wood
Where tha' hustla's got packs and the G's got stacks
And tha' pimps got lacks, rollin' through the hood
And it feels so good...
(Chorus: Jazze Pha)
And it feels so good
Turnin' corners with my pinky man
Through my hood
Chokin' on a B and switchin' lanes is understood (understood...)
I'm a baller livin' pimpish
Man, leather and wood
Said it feels so good (feels so good...)
(Twista)
Now I done seen plenty niggaz flip twenty's, flip twenty one's
Flip twenty two's, flip Jordans, flip two-fours
Mega ballin', new clothes
Momma got a new store, TV screens, hundred-forty spokes
And we fittina' roll, right off madison to the manor in a drop-top Lexus
Sippin' henny rollin' reckless
Feelin' so motherfuckin' good I could roll my vehicle to Texas
And spit it like, this is for the syrup sipper's...
Gotta slow it down so you feel it, plus it make the words figure
And spit some screwed shit and do shit so that you understand
When it come to spittin' rapid-fire lyric adrenaline then I be the motherfuckin' man...
Get the love, when I hit the club gotta freak in
It's the weekend and the DJ bumpin' ""Tattoo""
Track move like some southern, black blues, or like the Cooper, got cruise
And they got shoes it's packet-proof instead I be the hottest rap...
Dude... Ride to this while you peel, yo, hood
You could go around the block or travel the whole world
When you come back it's still yo hood
And it feels so good...
(Twista)
I spit some game wit the intellect
To the media, like I'm in the Encyclopedia Brittanica
Come and take over the world wit' me girl
If you good I might can see if I can be yo manager
Get yo career on track and yo life on point
And I'll show you how yo taxes go...
Tactics flow quicker than a hat-trick go, smokin' on some fire, galactic dro
I know it's good when you smoke that fire
Puff that herb, get that dirt, hit that lick
Cop yourself a motherfuckin' Bentley car
Cop yourself a motherfuckin' Bentley crib
Pop that ass, throw that dick, twork that thing, bust that nut
Drop that top, turn the base up, put you a chameleon paint on the truck
Get iced up, bumpin' Twista grooves
As I cruise new shoes rollin' smooth up in K-Town
In my city come and feel it ghetto blues
If you snooze you lose don't pay dues for the tre-pound
Take the time to kick wit' yo home girls... And feel yo nugz...
Keep on hatin' on the L, big family we gon' steady come up
And I'ma still smoke good, and it feels so good...
[Chorus] - repeat 2X
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some...
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some...
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some...
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some..."

Take you degrees deeper than death I get you dissed
To get you pissed, the mister split ya wrist
Thinking I bit twist now picture this
Me biting something from you, and you can't top me
Better yet stop me, or drop me, your technique is sloppy
Check my flow autopsy
Copy yet never be cleverly my shit blows up
Leaving them froze up, straight from the toes up
Rip these shows up, in my city, we run shit like president do
Turn you to residue, snatch you your revenue
Rip ""This and That"" like Dres'll a due
Vestibule, your dead bodies I feel we cut your hair short
Dissin the Chi, why dare sport
We fly more heads then airports
Thinking you hard but when I pull your card I bet ya stretch
Go fetch a Treach, I make him disappear like Etch A Sketch
Wretched nigga, keep Chi out your mouth or get your neck split
Quickly I used to wreck shit, but now punk I'm on some next shit
Check it, the crew you tried is making sure your bluer side
Face the beat down bitch nigga, fucking with Chi, suicide
Suidice when you're fucking with Chi - BOOYAH
I wonder why (I wonder why motherfuckers wanna die) [x4]
I come deep as golpher tactics, pop them like prophylactics
With flowmatics, no statics takin', breakin' punks up I'm a pro at it
Go at it with whoever, crew never cracks, pack gats
Fuck your chains and locks, chainsaws, hatchets, butter cutters and bats
Braids and blades and machetes, petty shit you carry
Can't scare me fairy, burn your obituary at the cemetery
II to a casket, heads in bread bask', was dead when lead blast
And burn him like ashes, FUCK A GHETTO BASTARD
Huh, come with that ""hey ho"", better stay low
End up with a halo, spread blood like mayo
Looks like a TKO, say no, to Treachery, bet ya be thinking you're ganking
I do the shankin', Naughty kids always get a spankin'
So uh, go diss some more emcees instead of these
Punk your better ease, or get your head filled up with holes like cheddar cheese
Never let a breeze, slow me down kid this ain't the season
""Tung Twist' back to Chicago""? Bitch, who told you I was leaving?
Suidice when you're fucking with Chi - BOOYAH
I wonder why (I wonder why motherfuckers wanna die) [x4]
Selector, my DJ cuts up, B-hyper, what's up
Let's beat the nuts up, eat the ducks up
Then sweep they guts up
The things I bring will make you spring forward and later fall back
Talking about Twisting don't impress you, like your shit is all that
Go get your tecs I got grenadas to pack pins
Be quick to stack men, black men with mac 10s
Ready to let their finger back bend
And if I catch your dreamin', of descendant schemin'
Y'all find an intoxicated demon, sucking semen, hear what I'm screamin?
Huh, another pussy wants to break me in a homosapian
Beat him down and wont give a fuck what type of shape he in
Yellow is the color of cape he in, punk your style'll be
Facing fatality, split his head like a personality
While I'll be cracking heads like jokes, leave a tight stitch
For dissing me hype pitch, fuck you and that white bitch
I'm hoping your mic switch
Remember that show in the West?
Thought I waswimp, man please, the pimp slam Gs
Swing on MCs like chimpanzees
Get your nose bust, bones broke, make rappers split with this shit
Talking shit about the Chi behind me back, now you get this bitch
What's up nigga, come on step, unless you just a sucker
Fucking with Chi, suicide mission motherfucker

You nowin the truth but you steady just be holdin' on
You harboring feelings but you don't be tellin' me
When you be see'n me would it be better if we was hollin on the phone
They tellin' me you got a problem, if it's a cancer
Baby the twista got tha cure that can solve it I got the answer
Too many guys, too many guns
Plenty muscle when I hustle
You think a nigga was takin' enhancers
We need to holla and get it resolved like gentelmen
Because if we don't I got those the turn niggas feminine
I'ma pursue when I pop it to'em they're goin' to be choppin and screwin as if I swallowed a bottle of benalyn
I'ma just goin' to end up and dumpin if we just don't holla bout somethin'
Because you just might makin' a plot to come murder me
Oh, your word to be, open heart surgery
Yeah you got a white t but I'ma be turnin' motherfucka burgundy
I think there's a better way that we can handle this
So sit down and talk at the table, we got to be adamant
Takin' a ride, and choppin it up in the phantom
As two niggas breakin it down like an analyst off the with cannabis
He say, she say
A nigga was steady be hearin the bogus remarks
Thought I was goin' to have to go get it when it get dark
We talked about it, shit squashed
Now how will I ever be knowin' about when struggles arrive
If you don't be open enough to let me see inside
Right on the surface of things you thinkin' that he's still alive
But since he's been incarcerated his spirit has died
He's sittin' off up in the county while he goin' be fightin a case
I'm seein the pain 'cause I'm lookin' him right in his face
Never got caught off for pushin a bird
Now he goin' be lookin' and 30 for murder
Even though he ain't on the tape
Soon as he got locked up I had to visit him early
The truth was the homies and none of those niggas was worthy
He gave me my game and told me how bitches'll burn me
Damn, I want to kill of the district attorney
The loser aka the prosecuter was a steady accuser
Of my boy as bein around as the number one shooter
They sayin' that the evidence is a rueger, a steady pursuer
What it do and make you disappear like the bermuda triangle
Why dangle a weapon in front of the court that I know he won't use
Now you in deep shit
Now I just gotta go pay off my lawyer's retainer
Homie gonna have a better defense
And I know that you ain't really feel like talkin' about it

Damn girl, you got a tattoo right there

Is it buy your cat (uh huh)
Where your tat, tat, tatty

Where your tat, tat, tatty

Hey there shorty, what you working with
Let me see you pop that shit for daddy
That's shining blowing big pound out a pro caddy pick up
Diamonds flick up protect your tip tattoo bezel that lift up
Blinding them ?booshy? hoes
I bends through the Gucci store
Grinning, Sprewells spinning, but I'm standing still
Man trying to call up this zig-zotic hot mama out by the Ville then
I'm talking top flight, high priced brown sugar
With the curly butter, thick hips and all
With the easy-e kitty cat paws, tatted above her bra
When the Twist sat down by her draws
But I guess that leaves dust and all
Cause a man keeps on running off
Just dropping her cheese, but shorty got me's
Taking trips to the tat shop, come on the black top
Let her feel Anita while we sold b's
Cause you really gotta get greedy
Fish that pearl, and then show it off to the world
Thickness shorty got niggas out here screaming
Let me see your tattoo girl
(Bennie Franks)
It's Mr. Fat, freaky, black, nasty and here for money grams
It's something 'bout a red bone tattoo, god damn
You need a cover up, X out your baby daddy name
Girl I know you love to fuck, just the way you took the pain
Check my name and Eddy came, oops I don't mean to be rude
I got a fetish for oops I mean I love some tattoos
Let's get up on a room, everything is on me
Ain't got an A and the ointment but I got some Vaseline
The Brandi, I can't stand it the way my mess
And let's get stranded, I kizzel my nizzel fa shizzel
My cameras handy, bumping to this shit type to break the walls down
In Miami, top notch swallow and keep the ostrich and get up
(High Beam)
I guess you with me like a reeeeal
And then she suck me like a neckbone
I've been gone slap then I took the Milly that home
Since nobody needed to drive I'ma be the one they gone put it on
(Did you know me daddy) Man I ain't even have to ask shorty
It was right before my eyes, tattoos on her chest
Snake wrapped around her legs all the way up to her thighs
Her size, scrumptious fulfilling the fantasy of me and my guys
When she pulled her pants down
Made me wanna buck she oh my, what a surprise
Man I'm hoping, she'll let a nigga get it wet I gets wild and open
Way too provoking, on the beach rubbing her body down with suntan lotion
What's that, another tat with the Playboy bunny by her cootie cat
Got one going in the crack of her ass
But she can't really see cause her booty fat
Girl you don't know what I'd do to that
Got limo scrapes ride the butter crack
Put Legit Ballin all across your back, take that off and let me see that

Sip the cris and light the hydro
Spider chick across the dance flo'
Pimps like them tilt the kango
At the club she shotguns 6-0-0
Straight to the Mo' she came out, her clothes
Tattooed up like her nails ain't gold
I'm searching around like I'm 5-0
I'm bout to put something on it this ain't no tattoo hoe"

Where we push up in the corners that we fight for
City from the shores breeds gangsters and Vice Lords
Bustin' pistols while we runnin' from the five-oh
Hit the adversaries up because we drive slow
Oh I'm a killa mayne, standin on these corners
Hustlin for my denim mayne, and if you try to move
Soon as I hear one shot
I'ma let the tec and desert eagle ride non-stop
If I have to I'll commit a murder just to maintain
Tell me what you thought I'm from a city where they gangbang
And I got that thang thang
Get it however you want it cop a fo' and then split
Hustle hard and work your way up till you holdin' a brick
Cop an ounce of this 'dro I got the flyest shit in town
Bet you within a week you'll be able to get a pound
Go ahead and drop you can whip on 24's to get around
Gettin' paper make me feel like... {la-da-da-dah-deeeee}
Let me see all of my gangsters come up - in Chi-Town
Let me see all of my hustlers come up - in Brooklyn
Let me see all of my riders come up - in the Bay

Let me see all of my bitches come up - in A-T-L

That's where the thugs lurks
I done been out there and seen them niggaz put in bloodwork
When I'm in the 100's you can always smell the scent of purple
These niggaz always gettin' money in they inner circle
Fuck with 'em they fin' to hurt you; gotta get they cash on
Necessary evil they quick to put the mask on
Then they gotta put the mash on; steady bustin' at each other
I take a tool and bust my strap and scream out ""Free my brother~!""
Bitch-ass motherfuckers; I'm about to break 'em out
If they hit me before they get me I'ma take 'em out
If we successful we gon' smoke a blunt and cruise home
Introduce him to his new Charger with no shoes on
Till the haters move on
Fin' to set up shop now, gotsta hold the block down

Where the true thugs, and the elite members of the mob at
Know somebody; better call them out or try to tell them later
When they tell you ""Where you from"" when they catch you on the elevator
The fiends lurkin, niggaz serve in pissy hallways
Can't say shit 'cause they be gettin' money all day
Mercedes parked out front, chillin' with a hat cocked to the left
In the ride with the glock cocked smokin' a blunt
300Z with the Lamborghini do's and some hoes with a big ol' project booty
And the beat kinda hot but the cops wanna come
To hold the work he got that duty
So they can't do nothin' to me
Seventh flo' with the 'dro now, nineteenth flo' by the rocks now
Gettin' paper make me feel like... {la-da-da-dah-deeeee}

But I didn't even blink in that fiscal karma
I just be stuntin' on these niggas and ballin' on 'em
Tellin' 'em I'mma be forever young
Cause ain't no motherfuckin' artist alive fuckin' with me
You know it, they compare to none
I am a Dark Horse
Creatively comin' from a dark force
Closin' the unexpected turn of events as I commence to
Givin' you another definition of hardcore
Lord have mercy on the souls that competed with me
And didn't know what I was capable of
Let a nigga on the track and I attack and snatch a beat
And murder it, especially off of an eigth of the bud
Now recognizing me is an abomination
Speaking on the coldest and I'm not in the conversation
Overachiever, forever the underdog
I spit it but still omitted from every writer's congregation
When I ain't on the list with the mic splitters
Every once in a while I do be quite bitter
The big 3D style about who quite iller
Dark Horse, Ray Allen, Mike Miller

Can't forget about him, 'cause he stuntin'

Spit it how I get it and they want it 'cause I flaunt it
Because I get to the money
If I get to that honey, I'mma have 'em all hatin' on me
Screamin' out ""that nigga just don't stop""
Intricate part of my style is the way I swag on 'em
When I'm goin' so fast and still it be so hard
And when I do I know these niggas can't fuck with me
Style, it be ugly, they don't want none of me
And if we do get into it, it's gonna be
Just some shit that's in front of me
I'mma come gunnin', we conquer all obstacles
And if it's possible, I'mma get money, we
Welcome haters and challengers, fakers not down with us
Takin' our sound from us, we can get it on
If they want a rhyme from us and I...
Be takin' 'em out of the faith of a doubter
The face of a coward, who's bravery's forsaken for power and then I...
See if he learned his lesson, not to bully the lil' one
'Cause he don't want it
Probably get the pistol off a molly that'll hit you
A one that'll come with a style of another phenomenal that'll be turnin' up the
Party when he diss you, it'll probably be an issue
If you think I'mma let you forget about the way
I can throw flames on 'em
Trinidad, All Gold Everything on 'em
Pull a Juelz and go all cocaine on 'em

Apparently, he went _Kamikaze_. The big question is,
Will the rapper survive?\""

You're gonna make it - you've gotta fiiiight

Now it was a war it was like I was in Vietnam
But I kill 'em all, cause _Kamikaze_ was the bomb
Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist
Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm
Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because it
This cup of death, Death was not yet meant for me to drink from it
Thinkin' how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride
I even had C4 duct taped to my stomach but uh
(You got a right to survive)
But you gotta have will and always be ready to come off the wall
They gon' be willin' to test you and catch you if you talk the talk
But I'ma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin' my body in chalk

Look at me now 'cause I'm standin on top of the globe (say what)
Makin' big money for spittin' my popular flow (say what)
Now look at the swagger of a platinum veteran servin' 'em medicine
It's not a given to work 'cause I'm choppin them O's
Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh
I'm stickin them daggers in haters just look at them cry
The shit don't affact us effect us they wanna imagine
They take us lay 'em on the back, I'm makin' 'em look at the sky
If I think they cool, I give 'em a dutch
If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch
If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust
If they talkin' shit I'ma bust at 'em and get 'em to hush
Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the streetsweeper
A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I)
Lyrical retriever but good with them heaters
When I'm full of passion and fury like when you listen to Syleena (and I)
Went multi-platinum when I stepped on enemy grounds
Now bodies all over the world is fin' to be found
And _Kamikaze_ was successful now c'mon and feel _The Day After_

In a hoopty shorty's will design a spot
So when the get pulled over them people wouldn't find the spot
But if you ain't got it hid you have the flowest
If you can throw it and motherfucker it's a nine or not
Just go back to where your thang lay
Cause lo key niggas they started out in the gang way
But if you wild when your aim spray
Them niggas that you aired out is gonna be comin' back the same day
In the middle of a war you ain't on the tip
If you get the guns and clips to keep doin' what you doin'
Is it the same chiefs that got the same beef
Claimin they ain't been doin' but be givin' it to 'em
Flamboyant niggas must be slow
If your bitch ain't get popped then it's a blessin she a lucky hoe
Cause no matter where the fuck he go
In K Town they will dress him in a casket and tuxedo
Cause you can't be actin' thug roof
Because of Hennesey and drug use these niggas love juice
Some don't even considered gettin' caught
'Cause when you talk up some shit the gonna be quick and let the slugs loose
These motherfuckers heart is love boo
Especially like them niggas up at Ghostown Windy City snipe
'Cause it's a pitty when hype
For niggas wanna get witty
For comin' too pretty
Get the chilli filled and desipher
To pay the piper and bow to viper
Twice is rough
Now is what I'm kickin hype enough
Cause every time I puff and write this stuff
I kick a frenzy facin fuckin' and fury 'cause I don't like to bluff
So if we ever get into it and let the static get to me
Lets squash it and make it history
Niggas actin' like the glad to die
So if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me
Just an unsolved mystery
(3rd verse)
Now listen they be kickin hocus pocus
I done said shit to put your motherfucking eyes out of focus
So writing what I wrote is hopeless
If you see our base and you said then you better be ferosheous
And matter fact I hope the dopest
For to try to cope this is hopeless
Cause my lethal rhymes
Is the kind that can beat you blind
And pre-design
I pee through mine
Like I see through lines
Check the brain and see define
The reason I'm gunnin I tried the runnin'
'Cause I should have let you know
I don't give a fuck you was fronted because you was blunted
West side to the hunters you can't step to hoe
In the state of emergency urgenlty the ambulance will come
And then the law will come demand the gun
But bullshit irrelevence they need evidence
Or trippin' on elegance they be holdin' out they hands for some
If anything they'll hand 'em some
Or get wit him here come the victum he be shot up in his pants and lungs
'Cause he actin' hard and ran his tongue
Don't mean another nigga he meet in the street gonna be the man to run
Cause a prison is some shit to see
Matter of fact fuck the talkin' my lip let me hit the B
Niggas actin' like they glad to die
So if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me
Just an unsolved mystery"
159,Up to Speed,2010,The Perfect Storm (2010),Midwest Rap,Twista,"Twista been comin' with fast lyrics for year,
I'm glad to see niggas catch up to speed
But when I come to doin' a intricate pattern I bet you
Y'all can never fuck with me (no way)
'Cause when it come to this music,
I am a Mobsta', I am a chief
And when it come to this rap shit
Then I am a monster, I am a beast
Never let negative energy interfere with this
I be from the Outer Limits and I devour to men to haters
That intend to annihilate what I put together
They don't want to do what I got out from a military
And they want to push and then fire my lyricist
I would murder 'em with the dialect of an apostle
I'm apocalyptic and I can kick it whichever way you wanna hear it
Ain't no tellin' who I'ma kill and bury
How can you fuck with a nigga willin' to kill 'em all
With the ability to body and brigade a motherfuckers that come
With the ruckus screw who any that's out of me
Whoever strategy you will try to initiate
Theoretically I'm decipher that's infinite
In other words I'm a molto I came through with polo
And one day I'ma go back and tell'em how them niggas
That hate on me 'cause I kept a circle and no will not affiliate
Ain't no impossible nigga I go the whole yard
Ain't no law with my continuum my minimum is forever
And ever nigga so whatever you wanna do it
Don't really matter to me lets handle it right now
What happen to goin' and pullin' nigga hoe card
Fuck all the thuggin' on the internet
'Cause I'm not into that I'm on a higher intellect
And I don't wanna catch a murder 'cause I know
That it's possible that you might die
Now they be tellin' me Twista come with the hard shit
I don't wanna disappoint 'em so I gotta get it in
And kill 'em with every syllable after syllable
Like a gorilla do when I beat 'em at a physical
I be knowin' the way I spit it be God's gift
'Cause I'm feelin' so fab, when I fuck a nigga up,
And send immaculate conception of something
And more than one the proportion of the distortion is biblical
Like Isaiah Deuteronomy and Leviticus
I be a lyrical prophet I'm a disciple with a rifle
When like John the Baptist,
My raps is a revelation of the genesis of ya down fall
I'm a playa you should follow me 'cause I'm infamous
And my flow is off the chain, I be rappin' about something holy
Then I talk about your body being cut up in pieces,
Out on the premises when they found y'all
You gotta give me the status of being a legend
In my continuum what I be givin' 'em be killin' 'em in everybody
Feelin' 'em I'm colder than December I'm a symbol
And I make 'em remember my emblem
I hit you with the automatic and see you in heaven
Committed a verbal murder we heard the surgery wasn't a success
When you was in the hospital so if I ever get charged,
I hope that I'ma get the minimum
(Repeat: x2)
Now there'll be no killing of Twista 'cause I'm omnipotent
But most of them niggas just hate on me 'cause I flow different
Like the way that I spit it once I get in a niggas ass
Intricate patterns of intelligently spoken words,
Killin' my enemy off with the dialect the Chicago and I'ma blast"
160,Victory or Death,1999,Legit Ballin' (1999),Midwest Rap,Twista,"2000
No mothafuckin mercy for tha new millennium
It's Victory or Death
I'm tha Twista in this bitch
Mothafuckaz talkin' 'bout styles and shit
And who bit what and who made what
Nigga fuck all y'all styles
I'm finna set this shit off like this here
Chitowns murderous mob gothic
Hard knock it give me tha mothafuckin ammunition I'll cock it
Respected like I'm one of Gods prophets
Gotta put it down for legit ballaz and you don't think
That I'll rock it annihilate that nigga
'Cause like a lamb I was sacrificed for this verbal murder religion
Imprisioned by my hunger to succeed
By the heart I be driven
No shakin, no shiverin, get your shit to bleed
Reciting street literature, shall I spit tha creed
Now who them mothafuckaz talkin' 'bout bitin
Go get me the pump-out of my trunk-I'm finna buss
Y'all better run punk
Fuck where you got your style from I be the one
Rippin the track and I'm murderin
I'm in the middle of killin' 'em off when the guns dump
With a young pump two to the brain don't even harm me
You fuckin' every party, you won't even startle
You' the harder crew of lyrical giants
Turnin' mothafuckaz like you to microscopic particles
To hype, to stop it the modules on cruise control
Ride out on these niggas-bitches-ho's
Ain't takin' no titles I instantly bruise your soul
Talkin' that shit to me- trigger vicious flows
Get to rippin my clothes and start snappin like I'm
Sniffin shit up the nose, and catchin convulsions
Till I'm trembling no surrendering start shootin and
Knockin' mothafuckaz out like Benalyn
Reminiscin' on that adrenaline
Oh, now you rememberin
Overdose 'em on poisonous poetry from the west to the wild y'all
Gangbagin like Gotti, rockin' tha party
Straight up shockin your body doin' it Kami Kaze style y'all
'Cause it's Victory or Death nigga, better stay out the way
When my adrenaline pumpin or you can get a..(click-clock-blast)
Die mothafucka die!
Ain't no makin' me bleed 'cause I've got family to feed
(Repeat)
Its victory or death nigga
I would rather die before I can't prosper I'm a mobsta
Won't stop ballin, because it's meant to be,
It's Victory or Death I gotta hustle till I'm gone
(Repeat)
To all the folks and the lords.
The bloods and the crips and every ward lets roll
You gotta go- for what you know
If it's retaliation get low
When you get to the calico let it flow
Make these niggaz know in the door
Make a mothafucka bleed for what you need
'Cause the familys gotta eat in the last days it's hatred and greed
Luv to the Gov's, B.M.'s, Field marshals, elites and the chief
Soldiers we better take heed and realize
Signs of the times, stand by yo 9,
Watch out for tha haters and write yo' rhymes
But the industry is set up to fuck you so you better be on the grind
Don't be one of the blind gotta stay alert
And put in work 'cause time is almost up
Twistas, Hurricanes, and Volcanoes erupt
So we can't stop the struggle,
I'm killin' my enemy, breakin 'em off and not givin' a fuck.
And I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
When I go to the sky
Thank you from savin' me form a torturous life of hell,
But hile I'm here I'm straight legit ballin until I die
Lets better these years, feel the blood sweat and the tears
Organize, I'll sit back and smoke a Philly witcha
Never scared of my peers, I only got federal fears
And I'm known to put it down for my city nigga
And when we get full of this indo
Hydroponics and Chronic lock up ya doors and tha window
Better go and call up your kinfolks
Cause the riders that's down with this mob
Will murder when the wind blow
Don't know what you info
We bring terror in this Apocalyptic era of Armageddon we headin in
And the only way we can survive is if we come hard
And strive to be gods instead of men!

Now, everything that I want in a woman
When I be lookin' at her body and her mind that's you
Me bein' able to give you what you want or what you need
When I'm becomin' a love, that's true
Please pose because when you do that
I know I could never say that the romance is through
D. Rose when I be comin', the whistles send you to a victory of an orgasm too
Have her with me when I kick back
When she roll one, I lit that
She a cold one the way she lick that
When I hit that she hit back, AOWWW!
When I give it to her how she wanna get it'll be the way to make her crazy
And every time that she see me on the TV screen she like ""There go my baby""
'Cause I be fuckin' her, she like the way I'm freakin' her, how I'm freakin' her
I'm the one I know she wanna be with
Make the call, what time you want me to pick you up? (you up)
Tell him you got somethin' to do when I hit you up - because

This could be reality far from folklore
When I look at your body and you be so fine
Like a coke line, the way she after me gotta be somethin' else I could tell she addicted
All on me like an methamphetamine but a better fiend
She was thick as hell so we kicked it
She became a follower, but she was a swallower
Got up with her 'cause I wanna see when she go bottoms up
The way she turn her bottle up - oh you a nasty girl
And you know that I'm the same way, and you like that shit, so don't give up
'Cause we gon' fight, and we gon' fuck

163,Warm Embrace,1998,Mobstability (1998),Midwest Rap,Twista,"(Liffy Stokes)
It's like I got the 4-4 cocked
On the block in it two door dropped
And my spot is keepin' but hot
The pussy-ass cop throw some murder in the lot
My nigga got popped with a bullet that was meant for me
The adapt by T's and B's and the regencies
Fuck what the reason be, I'ma start squeezin these
Them niggas ain't G's, they wanna be thugs
And it ain't shit, these ain't no motherfuckin slugs
The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here
I done dropped more dead bodies than tears
Brought to life momma's worst fears
Pictures of a son dyin' from that hot ones flyin
Baby mama's cryin at the funeral
Cause the magnum lit him like a Black and Mild
When I rolled out on his ass on the solo
I caught him up on mo-mo cookin up co-co
I got to tip on the low-low
Bust it there like po-po takin' lives with the, oh no
It's a 4-4, mini-missile with a silencer for the whistle
My favorite pistol, 'cause when I let that bitch ride
I know the homicide is being carried out in official
Niggas steady bumpin guns, but don't want none
Because of these hot ones that explode on contact
A manic that's prepared to die in combat
Besides all that a 4-4 keeps me laced, don't be petty to say
I can see the fear in your face
As I reach my waist for this warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-4
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go
Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride
But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill
And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill
But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace
All you muthafuckas better duck and hide
Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside
Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace
(Mayz)
I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives
With my customized 4-5
Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys
You muthafuckas better get wise
Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin' to kill the elite
Cause you ain't gettin' no more tries
Hate to make a nubian mother weap, but fuck it
Long as I don't hear the hoe cry
Split a beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise
No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five
Make sure the nigga crossed through dies
You don't wanna throw them thangs
'Cause when I cocked and aim it's time to think in a split second time
But Mayz ain't new to the game
I use the spark when the shots light up this thunderin crime
But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin
Punk pretend to be your friend till they get close enough to your ends
To do you in, that shit puts me on ten
And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend
Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin' big shit about war
Like he don't know my Speedknot Mob gon' win
But I dare one of you niggas to say my name
'Cause I put a fuckin' bullet into your closest kin
Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe
Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin
So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace
Before I fuck up your face like a can of mace
Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case
Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace
(Twista)
With you my passion, nina squeeze off seventeen, for sure
Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go
Miss Millimeter's makin' a mockery of motherfuckers gotsta be ruckus
When I get my clutches upon this hoe
Itchin' to let the barrel blow
Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow, geronimo
Spit 'em up and swallow slow
I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back
Payback from flashback, some bitches know
Bust till I see the chrome from the intro
You was fucked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion
Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked
Fuck the gazin and enemies get tore up from the blazin'
Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass
Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list
Deposition die for servin' them six
Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick
'Cause I be working my bitch
Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang
Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon
Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds
And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug
When it comes to her love, it's none above she drawin blood
Static under the bra 'cause every time I take a hit at the bud
And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug
Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock
When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess
Fuck the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls
If I see y'all be laid to rest, let me hit the sess
Loose revolver used to be a problem solver
But the nina made me a baller
No strap could take the place of the black nine
Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste
From my warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill (Nine-mill), nine-mill"

When you climbin from the bottom
To the top of that pole

The New Testament
These are the Street Scriptures for all my riders, niggaz, and hoes
Let me ask you a question:
Why give a bitch fame by sayin' his name?
When all I gotta say is you's a bitch
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you nigga
You ain't no killa, on the riz-illa
So High Beam my nigga, get with 'em
(High Beam)
Ah!
When I look that fool in his face and tell him he's a lie
Everybody want a cure but nobody wanna die
Put the cash in my face, I might take a try
Money motivated that nigga that threw up my sign
My wife's on my side with a .9 ready to ride
Hold my sixth sense up and ask buddy why
Shit get deep in the cold city of Chi
Could somebody, anybody tell me why-ay
Why-ya-y-yaah
Why-ya-y-yaah these boys they wanna try me-eeeee
Why-ya-y-yaah
Why-ya-y-yaah but these boys don't wanna die-eeeee

I'll sacrifice my word and my balls for this here
Straight down to earth with my real niggaz crack 'em beers
Straight up that mean mug muthafucka havin' no fear
What the fuck
You thought I was one of them bitch niggaz standin' right here
Legit Ballaz is the clique I break bread with
Niggaz I bust lead with
In the midst of confrontation, high-speed chasin'
Bend 'em, and bust 'em and stick 'em, I'm runnin' from the FED's shit
This is the New Testament, uh-huh we never dead bitch - NO
(High Beam)
I'll make that damn fool get on his knees and say please
Bitches in the neighborhood spreadin' disease
Hatin' ass niggaz starin' and studyin' me
'Cause I'm fresh up out the bank to get my daughter some cheese
But I got somethin' on my side like a lemon to squeeze
Lickin' 'bout a pack up at you muthafuckaz right at the knees
Probably givin' somethin' to fools cause the man in need
I been deep up in this game for a century
Now I'm makin' major moves and stackin' paper is my motto
Different day, different gear, hoppin' out a different auto
Put it on and I'll be jackin' off louchers like lotto
Showin' love to my niggaz who show me love in Chicago
It's fair but it's square, for the love of the game or they hate it
Many done died, plenty done tried from imitatin' it
Fuck what they say, keep faith in this world you'll make it
Thank him for everythang and every blessin' but don't fake it

Trapped up in this wild life, thinkin' to myself
Askin' the Lord for forgiveness and thankin' him for my wealth

Saturated with racial hatred result in a slug
That's why I stay high, gone off green
Fuckin' up muthafuckaz lyrically with the Beam

Using mommy as the rule of dumb when you choosing em

Seeing Kane cruising and wanting me and you with them
Cause it went down but you ain't true to them so who is them

Get up with a mady 9 chick that brings life to dicks
With Viagra's lips dips a tits and whips
Leaving dirty tips that chicks while they ride

Wide open

Babs coating she glad stroking
Loving the shit floating the drip

Ain't sugar coating shit blood sucking the dick
Type of chick hella buff picture perfect nigga
If I jerk this shit you must be worth it nigga
I know ya had a bitch but I converted nigga
To a hot dick sucking that clit ass licking perverted nigga
Got the nerve nigga pulling out a fat dick
Like a bitch wont get it wet with a slick lip
Lick on the tip with the tit lips
Deep dish how ya tricking on some sweet shits

If you ain't sucking than swallow back of the Tahoe
Mommy had ya happing like problems in sea like macono
Bitch sucking ramodo

Rub the dick all on my face while this nigga still cummin
Still humming niggas stunning what you tryin' to say something
