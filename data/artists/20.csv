0,"""P"" Is Still Free",1993,Return of the Boom Bap (1993),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Awww yeah! All ruffneck rudebwoy hold tight
Just a little somethin' for the Jeep
Turn my voice up a little bit and let's get this started
Comin' to you live and direct from the 1986 version
Comin' up to 1993
Of course Premier on the beat
Now check it out
The girlies is FREEE EEE cause the crack cost money oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE EEE cause the crack cost money oh yeah!
Ridin' one day in a '92 Beamer
After seven years I seen Denise she still a skeezer
But look what she did, she went and had a kid -- no dad
And just released her ass out the rehab
You think she'd act like she don't know
She's still a hoe, but umm check my man for the show
""Hiiiii, DJ K-R-S""
She tried to shake her butt, I rolled my window up!
She got pissed and said, ""You ain't all that!""
And went and got some other girl schemin for crack
In my car, I couldn't hear what they spoke about
I hit the ac-celerator and I was out!
I never check my man but I knew the plan
Come to the jam MC's in there be thinkin' they Superman
Sure enough, the place is packed with no breeze
Crazy girls -- and wall to wall MC's
I'm like a cat these MC's are Fancy Feast
I'm thinkin' of rhymes but I'm interrupted by Denise
She said, ""Kris I really need a favor honey
My girlfriend here really needs some quick money!""
I looked at her girlfriend and her girlfriend was fly
But I ain't stupid, she had that LOOK in her eye
I touched her back, she said, ""Denise has he got the crack?
Is he the one? I gotta run back and feed my son""
I said, ""How old is your son?"" She said, ""Three months""
I walked away but my man cold bust her fronts
So she pulled out a gun and shot him in the party
Except for the MC's, I knew EVERYBODY
She tried to let off a shot, one more time
But got stomped so bad, she turned to wine
No one could find Denise for several weeks
You know the time, on this '93 beat
The girlies is FREEE-EEE, cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE-EEE, cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I knew a group that had a dope lead singer
Swinger, single guy, that knew his style was fly
After the show he was tired sweaty and kinda sloppy
But of course, a million girls are in the lobby!
He saw a group of girls hangin' out and lookin' good
So he took one to his room because he knew he could
Inside the room he said, ""Make love to me and never stop""
She said, ""Sure, but how's about a crack rock?""
I knew my man down the hall had it all
So he called, down the hall, but homeboy wasn't there at all
He turned to the girl and said, ""My man ain't there""
So she let down her hair, unzipped his pants down right there
Oral sex in effect, or rather deep throat
But just before he came she bit his dick and slit his throat
As he fell back dizzy, he began to choke
She took his wallet and said, ""You ain't broke!""
The girlies is FREEE-EEE, cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE-EEE, cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
* DJ Premier cuts 'n' scratches ""Oh yeah!"" *
Yes Premier you know you rule hip-hop, an'
Yes Ced Gee you know you run hip-hop, an'
Yes Kenny bwoy you run hip-hop, an'
But KRS-One'll rock it non-stop!
When I'm Brooklyn, we rulin HIP-HOP!

Over in Brazil yes we rulin HIP-HOP!
Over in Germany we rulin hip-hop
But in New York, we rulin y'all tonight badda-bye-bye-bye

We come to rock you whether you black or you white
Cause KRS-One, you know I'm never frank, come catch the style
The girlies is FREEE-EEE, cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE-EEE, cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!"
1,1st Quarter - the Commentary,1997,I Got Next (1997),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Welcome to hip-hop culture
Where DJ-ing, MC-ing, graffiti art, breaking
And the philosophies are expressed everyday
Within the inner cities of America, and the world
You are not doing hip-hop
You ARE hip-hop
Love yourself and your expression, you can't go wrong"
2,2nd Quarter - Free Throws,1997,I Got Next (1997),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Anybody in here right now with tape decks turn 'em on
And put 'em on record, I'll give you a second
I want to add authenticity to your tape
So when it's sold out in the street
You all can know this was a real party
These are poems circulating throughout the nation
Everybody's bad and everybody's tough
But how many people are intelligent enough
To open up their eyes and see through the lies
Discipline themselves, yourself to stay alive?
Not many
That's why the universe sent me today on this stage
With this to to say
The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer
And in the final hour many heads will lose power
What does the rich versus the poor really mean?
Psychologically it means you got to pick your team
When someone says the rich gets richer
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture
The rich get richer, 'cause they work towards rich
The poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto
Let go, it's not a novelty
You could love your neighborhood without loving poverty
Follow me, every mother, father, son, daughter
There's no reason to fear the New World Order
We must order the whole new world to pay us
The New World Order and the old state chaos
The Big Brother watching over you, is a lie you see
Hip-Hop could build it's own secret society
But first you and I got to unify
Stop the niggativity and control our creativity
The rich is getting richer, so why we ain't richer?
Could it be we still thinking like niggas?
Educate yourselves, make your world view bigger
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture!"
3,3rd Quarter - the Commentary,1997,I Got Next (1997),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"For those interested in higher knowledge
On issues of health, wealth, and self-mastery
You are urged to register with the Temple of Hip-Hop
By filling out the attached registration form and questionnaire
Located on the album's pull-out panel
And here now, another KRS classic"
4,4th Quarter - Free Throws,1997,I Got Next (1997),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Yeah, listen to the lyrics
We are the ones prophesized to return
My main concern is for all of you to learn
How to live, yes through the lyrics I give and send my friend
This age is coming to an end
Not the world, but the age is ending
Ending, listen to the astrological message I'm sending
I'm sending, tell em
Truth is truth, whether or not you like me
We are living now in the age of Pisces
When Pisces is over, at the year two thousand
When the Sun of God, changes his house and
Enters the Age of Aquarius
The Sun of God as man is hilarious (okay)
When you think of Jesus, think of the Sun
The flaming Sun, that's where they stole this concept from
Stop believing and read your bible logically
The new testament is really old astrology
Jesus is the son of God no lie
But they might be talking about the Sun up in the sky
The Sun, that hangs on the cross of the zodiac
The zodiac with twelve signs to be exact
Each sign is a house, and you should keep in mind
Each house equals, a period of time
The time, two thousand years and that's a fact
It's called an age or a house in the zodiac
The twelve disciples, are twelve months of reason
The four gospels signify the four seasons
When Jesus fed the multitude with two fishes
It signified the Age of Pisces, not fish or dishes
If you read the bible astrologically it's clearer (no doubt)
The next age will be the age of the water-bearer
It's called the Age of Aquarius (word)
When logic and truth will take care of us
So in this age, of spiritual dignity
You'll see a rise in femininity
And creativity, meshed with masculinity
You got to get with me, this is your true her-story (rrry!)
Do you wanna go higher..."
5,9 Elements,2003,Kristyles (2003),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Well my ladies and gentlemen
This is a rapsession and my name is ""KRS-One!""
And when I talk about ""Hip-Hop Music!"", I know
(Kris)
One : Breaking or breakdancing
Rally b-boying, freestyle or streetdancin'
Two : MC'ing or rap
Divine speech what I'm doing right now no act
Three: Grafitti art or burning bombin'
Taggin', writin', now you're learning! uh!
Four : DJ'ing, we ain't playing!
{*Scratch*} You know what I'm saying!
Five : Beatboxing
Give me a {*beatboxin*} Yes and we rockin'!
Six : Street fashion, lookin' fly
Catchin' the eye while them cats walk on by
Seven: Street language, our verbal communication
Our codes throughout the nation
Eight: Street knowledge, common sense
The wisdom of the elders from way back whence
Nine : Street entrepreneur realism
No job, just get up call 'em and get 'em
Here's how I'm tellin' it, all 9 Elements
We stand in love, no we're never failing it
Intelligent? No doubt
Hip-Hop? We're not selling it out, we're just lettin' it out
If you're checkin' us out this hour, we teatchin' hip-hop
Holy integrated people have it, I'm the present power!
Rap is something you do!
3x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*
Rap is something you do!
Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*
(Kris)
Skaters, BMX-bike riders rock
Don't you ever stop! You are hip-hop
You doing the same things we did on our block in the suburbs
You know you be packing that black block
Selling that crackrock and ecstacy
Gettin' pissydrunk, fallin' out next to me
But like I told those in the ghettoes
Here's the facts! True hip-hop is so much more than that
Some much more than rap, so much more than beats
Hip-hop is all about victory over the streets
What you see on TV is a lie
That's not something you wanna live or pattern your life by
But, huh that's too much preachin' ain't it?
You don't want the ?education?, you wanna be dead on the pavement
Well, so be it, some of y'all ain't gonna see it
Others wanna enslave your mind! Kris wanna free it!
Rap is something you do!
5x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*
""Oh yeah"" *scratched* --- From ""P is dead""
""I have spent my whole life livin'"", ""talk to the fullest"", ""no doubt""
(Kris)
You know that's why these rappers can't hang
Cause the essence of hip-hop is not a material thang
They so careless, hip-hop is in a {?} we give
Rap we do, hip-hop we live
How many times I gotta say it? How the radio ain't gonna play it
And you hip-hoppers sit back and okay it
Think about it! (think about it)
The present course of action, we have got to reroute it!
(Chorus: repeat 3X)
Hip-Hop is something you live!"

True school, you got to stop BS'in, with this
New school you got to stop BS'in with this
Cause y'all don't know that y'all ALL are bein controlled by corporations
Where's your hip-hop museum? Where's your hip-hop doctors?
Where's your hip-hop judges? Hip-Hop lawyers?
Where's our hip-hop agriculturalists? Our hip-hop army?
We better have some hip-hop police police our hip-hop self
If we gon' do all this killin'
We are at war brothers and sisters...

7,A Freestyle Song,2003,D.I.G.I.T.A.L. (2003),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Here comes the mighty
Yes I'm a righty
I live in a apartment with my mom
I rap becuz I listen to beats on CD roms
Man I wish I was on the road to fame
Instead they say I'm lame
But ill try to prove them right
I just think they're lookin' for a fight
Forget it
Ill just get my revenge on them rabbits
No I'm just playing
I just hope I keep praying
I couldn't hear what my mom was saying
All I heard was
Blahbleebblibblob
My brotha has an imaginary friend named
Bob
All he does is talk about gob
Naw ill quit talkin'
And ill just keep walkin'
I'm outy
Before it gets too crowdy
I'm out"
8,A Friend,1997,I Got Next (1997),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"The beat was sposed to drop right there
The beat was sposed to drop right there
The beat was sposed to drop right there
Yeah yeah yeah... uh
I send this one out, to my right hand man
Or mens, or womens, the whole crew
The real fam
Chorus: KRS-One
We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin videos
Or actin' really silly yo but really doe
All that can end...
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend
Verse One: KRS-One
If we can't have trust then you can't hang with us
We respond to those who show respect with respect
We respond we connect on the same deck
Same intellect, my man, never shifty, thinks quickly
If you can't understand, we boys we boys
We could stand on the corner with a hat sellin toys
It ain't about your Benz I hope it ain't about mine
My man, I be dissin in my freestyle rhyme
Gettin' G's around the world, I can trust you with my girl
My man, we chillin' at the jam, what's the plan?
I'm not a yes man and none of my friends are yes men
Or women, I'm drivin', I see my peeps yo get in
Where you fit in? True friends are quick to sit
In the beginning of all trouble, and when your bankroll doubles
Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble
Still I got my own space like Hubble
Verse Two: KRS-One
Cause don't nobody care about us, all they do is doubt us
Until we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
And wanna shout us, but you my man from way back
I just gots to say that, actin' large I don't play that
But I can't say that, where I play at isn't fast-paced
A friend can acquire the taste to become two-faced
And that's a disgrace there ain't nothing you can say to us
When the kid you grew up with betrays your trust
When we used to ride the bus we had trust
Now we cash checks and drive Lex, and can't show respect to one of us
Yo the heads I hang with ain't tryin' to just get
What they can get, sit quickly backstabbin the click
I roll thick, but only some are friends really
Down to the end, my right hand men and women
Mutual support, from the beginning
Been in, exactly what I've been in
Verse Three: KRS-One
Back to back we attack corporate America
Gettin' fees that amount to G's in every area
You my man I ain't gotta drag you along
You pull your own weight, yeah you definitely got it goin' on
I don't see nothin' wrong wit a little bumpin car system
Thumpin, between the crew we always got sump'un
But if we had nuttin no frontin whatever
We'd still be crew you and me, me for you together
Word, fake people ain't worth a turd
They only want to be your friend because of what they overheard
I send this record to the well respected
Friends that I've collected, I hope I am what you expected
Yeah, so check it, so check it"

I be illin, parental discretion is advised still
Don't call me nigga, this MC goes for his
Call me God, cause that's what the black man is
Roamin through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
Let it be known, you can lean on KRS-One
Like a wall 'cause I'm hard, I represent GOD
Wack MC's have only one style: gun buck
But when you say, ""Let's buck for revolution""
They shut the fuck up, kid, get with it
Down to start a riot in a minute
You'll hear so many Bowe-Bowe-Bowe, you think I'm Riddick
While other MC's are talkin' bout up with hope down with dope
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY!
That's for calling my father a boy and, KLAK KLAK KLAK!
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO!
That's for calling my sister a hoe, and for you
BUCK BUCK BUCK, 'cause I don't give a motherfuck
Remember the whip, remember the chant, remember about rope and
You black people still thinkin' about vot-ing
Every president we ever had lied
You know I'm kinda glad Nixon died!
Verse Two: KRS
This is not the first time I came to the planet
But every time I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin' to like
Get wit you, showin you, you are invincible
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
In my spiritual form, I turn into Bobby Seale
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
And enters into Kwame Ture
Verse Three: KRS-One
In the streets there is no EQ, no di-do-di-do-di-do
So I grab the air and speak through the code
The devil cannot see through as I unload
Into another cerebellum
Then I can tell em, because my vibes go through denim
And leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin'
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin'
Have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
We got no time for fancy mathematics
Your mental frequency frequently pickin' up static
Makin' you a naked body, attic and it's democratic
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic"

Uh! They don't wanna battle
They ain't ready for the battle, uh-uh, uh-uh (Temple of Hip-Hop)
Listen, listen, listen
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Your spirit AIN'T READY
Your church AIN'T READY
Your bishop AIN'T READY
Your deacons AIN'T READY
Your choir AIN'T READY
Your ushers AIN'T READY
At the Temple of Hip-Hop
We teach many!
(KRS-One)
Look! To all my people hurtin', all my people searchin
What we know for sure, God is always workin
Workin while you flirtin, workin while you jerkin
Workin while the world is turnin' and these cities burnin
God is always workin, workin while you learnin
Workin while you ignorant and when you're not concernin
Christ consciousness, get that, got that
Spit that, rock that, hip that, hop that
You sniff that? Stop that, I give back and got back
Greedy? I'm not that, you needy for that shock rap
Slangin on the block rap, duckin where the cops at
I don't know that, but Jesus done copped that
Not that man on the cross, it ain't like that
You must act like the son of God, that's where the lights at
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
(KRS-One)
One thing's for sure and believe it hurt
It's when the pastor ain't sure, and deceives the church
They don't know God's law, and can't see God at work
So when they see hip-hop, they push it to the back of the church
Like fig trees or figures they don't bear fruit
They gospel artists, still tryin' to chase that loot
Hear the truth now, I come to enhance the light
They women of God, singin' while they pants is tight?
They not hot! Really they, regular
They clothes they flows, all that, secular
What's the difference I could stay in the world and wild
If these church girls wear more makeup than Destiny's Child
Keep it real Christian, some of y'all liftin ain't likin
But this is the difference between a Christian and a Christ-ian
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
... Listen, listen, listen
(KRS-One)
Look! Spiritual minded, you must find it
Find your spirit and go deep inside it
This goes out to the Christ-ians listenin
This is the flow that, gospel's missin' it's
Urban inspirational rap
We got our own section in the record stores, in our own rack
We respect tradition, from the start
But we now know, the true word of God is written in our heart
We gotta say somethin' to the streets kid!
All these churches surroundin the devil still ain't defeat it?
They the type to get down, I'm the type to get up
From ""Criminal"" to ""Spiritual Minded"", now raise your head up
Let me start, these rappers ain't got God in they heart
All they want is quick money, and a movie part
Let me begin - what, where, why or when
What's the use of double platinum if you're livin' in sin
Hear the truth - how long you think you gonna last
Rockin' the mic, without havin' to go back to class?
Now you're forced, to listen to the teacher outrap them
Yes there's life after platinum"

They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one
It's supposed to be...
(KRS)
This is the way it's supposed to be
It's supposed to be like you more close to me
It's supposed to be about our families
It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
But it's all about salary and flattery
Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
And you know about how they runnin' this game out
It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
But it's all about clout and poppin' them chains out
Instead of forgiveness, we poppin' they brains out
It's supposed to be about seekin' in the seek out
You witnessin' injustice, you got to speak out
If you claimin' you love this, you got to release doubt
Knowledge is what I'm all about
(KRS)
Well it's supposed to be sunlight over me
Light over you, not you runnin' over me
It's supposed to be a two dollar royalty minimum
A Hiphop guildówe got to begin buildin' 'em
It's supposed to be NO police brutality
And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
It's supposed to be museums and archives
Where people can see the importance of OUR lives
But it ain't about any of this
Cats are trying to get that diamond-studded Rolex on they wrist
You hear a voice in the wildernessóyou know it's Kris
Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
But it's supposed to be about makin' it better
You see, Hiphop's not a product like pants or sweater
Go aheadóbe a hero, get your cheddar
Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that
(KRS)
You can see in your heart how it's supposed to be
You doin' your part, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
Pursuin' your art, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
Today you will start, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
It shouldn't be about you movin' slowly
Then talkin' junk when you don't even know me
And you cats be pussy like Josie

Everybody in the hood ain't your homie
I spit the truth, but I'm not the only

14,All My Men,2008,Maximum Strength: Two Thousand Eight (2008),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Woo!
Where my men at? Real dudes
Where you at? Look
(Chorus: KRS-One)
Me is a mon, understand, not a passin trend
Me is a mon, understand, we provide and defend
Me a mon with a plan, my love it never ends
I'm callin - all my men, ALL MY MEN~!
All my men that be holdin' down they house and they spouse
Men, y'all know what I'm talkin' about
Real men, providin for the kids, no doubt
Holla out, 'gwan shout, you the man of the house
Men! In my opinion if we gonna start winnin'
F'real, we gotta respect women
Every mister, hug your sister, it's the
Time to support your woman and not diss her
It's the, teacher, overstand
I'm like a preacher, reachin' your upper man
Man, many don't understand
How important it is to have a plan
All my men that be holdin' they house down, true workin
All my men that be holdin' they spouse down, for certain!
You spread love when you drivin' around town, not jerkin
You a healer, you take away what's hurtin'
'Cause if a man can't do what a man plans to do, his purpose
Then a man makes plans with empty hands, he's worthless
He can't even understand the plan
What the second or the first is
Let me verse this or reverse this statistic
We gotta think futuristic
Strategic, logistical and even mystical
We need a new ritual
I'm tired of jumpin' over buildings
And havin' to stop to hold adult hands like children
C'mon, you can do it, c'mon
And when they get paid then they quickly run along
This ain't just another song
This is that fruit that reveals the right from the wrong
It won't be long here, before the storm's here
And real men are gonna have to be strong
Be a MON, stand on principle
Just be a MON, let God live in you
Just be a MON, walk in the spiritual
Metaphysical, political, lyrical
Just be a MON! Understand you not a passing trend
And this is the end"

Gather round, I want to tell y'all a story
See if you can get the meaning
We gonna go real far (all right)
Watch this (God, you all right)
I'm steppin' in this place like it's all right
I got my partners with me, yep we feelin' all right
I got my woman with me, yup she lookin' all right
When it's time to move I'm never left, I'm all right
Well, I met my man ""What up Duke? "" - ""I'm all right""
He said ""Listen to this"", I said ""All right""
He said ""This strictly confidential"", I said ""All right""
He said ""Yo, you like this spot? "" I said ""It's all right""
""You wanna change it? "", I said ""All right""
""I got a way that we can purchase it in 30 days"" - ""All right""
""How we gon do that? "" He said ""All right""
He put a stack of hundreds on the table right there, I said ""All right""
30 days later we all right
Limousines, elevators, yo things are lookin' all right
All night everybody feelin' all right
I told my man ""I gotta go"", he said ""All right""
""Let me take your Jeep"", he said ""All right""
But just as I started the car it got all bright
I started liftin' up, felt my spirit driftin' up
What's goin' on? The Jeep is gone and everything's all white
I heard people sayin' ""Is he all right? ""
Floatin' above my body I felt all right
How can I tell 'em, really tell 'em, that I'm all right?
Standin' outside my cerebellum I'm all right
The fourth dimension is all right
The fifth dimension is sure right
The sixth dimension is all light
Livin' as a spirit is all right
But then I didn't feel all right
I felt the shock in my chest, it wasn't all right
They revivin' me - all right
I heard a paramedic say to someone ""Yep, he gonna be all right""
I'm back alive, people askin' ""Are you all right? ""
""The Jeep exploded. It's a miracle you all right""
Layin' there on my back, strapped up all night
I smirked and said to myself ""God, you all right""
""Ha, you all right""
""Yes, God, you all right"""

I'm known for my scary feuds
That's why I'm called The Terrorist by the Daily News
I rarely lose, I'm known to rattle a cage
I'm known to throw rappers off the stage
Maybe it's a matter of age

17,Alright With Me,2003,Kristyles (2003),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"I've got the illest live show (Now what you sayin'?)
I drop the illest rhyme flow (Now what you sayin'?)
But you still want to act like you don't know
Well, that's all right with me
People sample me like James Brown (Now what you sayin'?)
When they want to hear that sound (Now what you sayin'?)
But you still want to put me down
Well, that's all right with me
(Verse One)
The Kristyles is officially on blast
Don't worry about what he say, 'cause he won't last
If you want to learn the way take a seat in this class
I write albums like singles and release them so fast
I get around the whole country on foot like Flash
I don't fly across country I be there with the mass
Drivin', drivin', pulling up to your hood spot
You sayin' to your son, ""now this how radio should rock.""
I pray for these radio cats 'cause they don't know
How fast I be movin when they be movin slow
This ain't no fast food rap dude, get it and go
This that home cooked type meal, lyrical flow
Spiritual grow, ya know 'cause ya was there, fo sho
Like Joey Greck I'm not the average Joe
(Yo, welcome cats to the BDP show
With KRS, Kenny Barker, G Simone, and Chalk-o)
I've got the illest live show (Now what you sayin'?)
I drop the illest rhyme flow (Now what you sayin'?)
But you still want to act like you don't know
Well, that's all right with me
People sample me like James Brown (Now what you sayin'?)
When they want to hear that sound (Now what you sayin'?)
But you still want to put me down
Well, that's all right with me
(Verse Two)
I spit when I speak, when I speak I spit
When I spit what I spat it splits ya clique
Spit, spat, speak, spoke, either way
I spat that your rap's not dope any way
When you spoke I spit that splattered your scope
I split that and spit that unanimous quote
No hope when I battle I'm staggering folk
They slip-sliding away there rappers ain't dope
Get my coat, I make sure you can see shells
For sure you gon' see them 'cause all you see is sales
Forget it you ain't wit it, admit it
Every thing you did I already did it
I've got the illest live show (Now what you sayin'?)
I drop the illest rhyme flow (Now what you sayin'?)
But you still want to act like you don't know
Well, that's all right with me
People sample me like James Brown (Now what you sayin'?)
When they want to hear that sound (Now what you sayin'?)
But you still want to put me down
Well, that's all right with me
(Verse Three)
Too many emcees not enough time
Nine out of ten niggaz say they wanna rhyme
Four out of nine talk about drugs and crime
Three out of four say they wit it but they not
Two out of five spit fire plus the underground
One out of three spit righteous but they never shine
One out of two claim they ballin all the time
And only one make it to prime
Do that math, only one Biggie, one Pac, one Jay-Z
One Nas, one Fifty, one X, one Slim Shady
One KRS-One, one L, one K, one Busta, one Pun, one Love, only one me
Take that TNT, that spit is my property
You copy me, fuck you, pay me (nigga)
I've got the illest live show (Now what you sayin'?)
I drop the illest rhyme flow (Now what you sayin'?)
But you still want to act like you don't know

Right here with the teacher, KRS-One
Album #13, ""Keep Right,"" or you gon' get left
You know what time it is, ain't no time to be frontin
Trust yourself, get with the movement
Yo teacher, let 'em have it - like this, c'mon
(Krs-one)
You get the CD and then, it's time to see me again
You break it open and then, no we not jokin again
Turn on your player and then, the rhyme sayer again
Put in the CD and then, you can't believe me again
Turn up the volume and then, we blowin' by you again
You start to listen and then, you see the mission again
You start to listen and then, you get the vision again
U-N-I-T-Y that spells unity man
On G-O-D I demand, as you can see I don't end
Your family I defend, don't battle me you won't win
I'm not livin' in sin, but I'm livin' with Him
Her/They/Them/Us trust yo let us begin
KRS is unique, you can hear how I speak
I be teachin the streets, I'm fin' ta reach for the peak
I rock a club every week, I keep them thugs on they feet
He's back, just me, please, don't try to compete
I kick that knowledge in college when I club it it gets rugged
And you can see that these others be garbage and I love it
Uh, what's the state of hip-hop? Don't confuse it with rap
It's the state of your mind, it's the way that we act
It's that thing that makes you say yo I can never be whack
It's also clickin through my lyric lickings spittin' the facts
Hot tracks y'all prep for combat
Baby I'm back, they crazy whack, takin' 'em out!
The philosophical flow son, that's live at my show son
I'm soundin like no one, you feelin' me though?
The people want me back like they want The Arsenio Show
They want the real, not a video hoe!
This is KRS-One, you gotta believe me
I'm sittin' in the studio with Nice and B.C.
See me tonight, we keepin' it tight

I'ma grow dem and show dem what a leader is
I'ma teach dem the laws of receive and give
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, believe and live
You done heard the hype, COME to where the talent is
""I'm Still #1,"" yup you heard right
People say, ""KRS-One you shine bright!""
Others say, ""Yo - you rhyme tight""
When you find me, you find light, and that's all right
I don't know about pimpin', sellin women like retail
Or turning coke into crack for resale
But I do know if we fail
In 2020 our children by the million gonna be jailed
We got the victory over the streets
God willin' we chillin', we know we gon' eat
I'm a whole different kind of MC, hoes don't like
Not tempt me but the ladies treat me oh so gently
Universities sendin me stretch Bentleys
My seminars and lectures, are rarely never empty
We teach students plenty, honorary degrees
Gold and platinum plaques I got many, ask Kenny
People get shocked when I walk into Denny's
Or the corner Kwik-Stop, they say, ""That's Hip-Hop
Right there,"" and yeah it's really quite clear
2004 might be the right year
For mental and spiritual repair
The solution is in the resolution you just declared
(KRS-One)
When I speak like this
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, hip-hop philosopher
All in the street well I'm very popular
All through the hood I make all the stops and I
Avoid the cops and them random shots well I
Love hip-hop and I, live hip-hop so I
Spit that shit to get you off your block 'cause I
Can't understand and I, wish I could see dem
Cats that talk bout they love the hood and they
Never bring the hood anything that's good, and they
Rap for the money tree, chasin a company
But I think you can now see, rap is fun to me
I got a ministry, a class, a staff that's under me
KRS in pop rap? Nah, it ain't ought to be
It'll never happen like, you eatin pork with me
Amateurs hawkin me, DON'T EVEN talk to me
My house is in Atlanta but I still got New York in me
Walk with me, most rappers are short to me
I'm like Chamberlain, dominatin the sport you see
I toss MC's off of me
When you hear KRS you say that's how it ought to be

I drop heat like this!"

Bet this gunblast, seek your chest and leave your moms brokenhearted
Get me started, come up against THIS, is you RETARDED~?!
I ain't shit on you motherfuckers yet, I only farted
Take the dopest nigga from my borough, that's Kris, put him on my shit
The hottest latino rapper Big Pun, up on this fly shit
G. Rap the sole survivor with Truck, kills all the nonsense
With Marley doin' the track it's big, I mean jurassic
Like Coke this is a Classic, from the cradle, to the casket
Gonna blow from Bangkok to Brooklyn
Beijing to the Boogie Down, then back to my block
Cops follow the trail, that lead back to me
I'm waitin for 'em with 2 Glocks, blow they balls off like 2Pac
Go clutch, the holy drawers, can't save you
Still gonna be a holocaust, Truck TUrner show no remorse
Go 'head nigga, FLOSS~!
We gon' be around when the sun go down to rob you
Then gun you down, the fo'-fo' make a thunder sound
Rush in like, hug the ground I'mma count to 10 don't turn around
You see my face? I'mma blaze you
Lettin in off, another round, and another round
Till your family, put your underground
I told you kid, I lay you down
Spray you down, claim your town, Bronx bound
A team player don't play around

(Big Pun)
Soy, con {?} aqui (boricua - light up the mic for the symphony)
Whack rappers I humiliate like half a mic in The Source
Blast you right off of the stage and engrave a butcher knife in your corpse
What'chu writin is soft, I'm Pearl Harbor war
Run up on your small empire and spray your tires like you Armor All
Who wanna brawl with the Bronx finest
Talk your highness {?} thicker force like our monster rhymers
Hate y'all B, I know you hate my stee'
'Cause I'm the son of Tony you phony like fake ID
It's the S-H-I-T, you can smell it
Gun smoke makin' you choke, take a toke and inhale it
Now you can feel it (what?) Deep inside your lungs
Like hot pellets when you're shot up, we supply the guns
Now where you from state your restin zone
I'm from the BX, B'lawn is where T.S. call home, where KRS was born
Let it be known if I don't get you watch for our God
'Cause when you diss Kris, you disrespectin MY SQUAD
Put that on my mother, motherfucker
How DARE you disrespect, BITCH~!

Aiyyo we comin' through with the fifth and Glock, rippin shots
And hittin blocks, leavin' kids rocked, put in a hidden box
Splittin tops, leave his face hot, dotted like chickenpox
Cursin cops with bloodhounds, sniffin socks, sniffin rocks
No trace, get your clique rubbed, your wigs plugged, the shit blood
Catch your big mug, topless just like a chick with big jugs
Up in the strip club, beer is a Bud, no coffee
Blowtorch like auto mechanics, you ordered to panic
She slaughter you bandits, your daughter be planted, inside the ground
More than the granite, my gunshots'll make you orbit the planet
""Roots of Evil"" peepin up all legal or illegal
The four-fours are lethal, cock back the gat to pop the wheelies like Knievel
Fire shots to rented Regals
Leave all your peoples with palsy in they cerebrals
Deadly as an addict's needle, let automatics reap you
Sweep you, I'm sendin you to Lucifer to keep you
Heat you, nail you to the cross on top of the church's steeple
Red dots cover your face like the measles

Did it like juice with gin in it - ha ha JACKPOT, we winnin' it
You talk that shit, but you really illiterate
Read your shit like he he he, the the the the...
Sound out the word, connect the noun with the verb
Stick with b-b-b-bird-bird cause the battle's absurd!
Don't let these young kids go soup that ass up
You'll get smashed up, you gassed up, you puttin' that ass up really?
I don't even see you in the new milline-um
I see you like on VH1 with Milli Vanilli an' them
Talkin' about what you used to have, your abusive dad
Oh it's so so sad, 'cause I'm just so so death defyin, mesmerizin
Every time you say you dope that's false advertisin, but it's not surprisin
You lyin', you ain't no battle hog
What you got one demo, against my 12 year catalogue?

You best to beware, oh yes
When you advertise in New York, you best to beware
Cause the bling bling, and de sex t'ing
Dem no care, oh no, you best to beware
Oh no, yo you best to beware, oh no no
This is how they do it kid, I thought you knew it kid
This is how they set us up listen I can prove it kid
Many don't understand, you see it's all a plan
To keep the black man a child like he's Peter Pan
You'll never see a man, a real black man
Until you see a man with control of his hands
And to control your hands means you control your mind
And to control your mind means you ain't committin crimes
Man you smarter than that, goin' to prison is whack
Even the people in prison know I'm spittin' the facts
I'm gettin' open, open the class up
Don't smoke crack it'll tear yo' ass up
Listen! We got our own problems here in the States
So you know I'm not pointin the finger BUT WAIT
This is somethin' y'all got to see
Even the UN knows violence begins with poverty
When you ain't got no money, it's quicker to kill
It's human nature that's way the jails are filled
And the MILITARY? From the time you sign up
To kill your neighbor man it's a SIN already
And SIN meaning Selfish Inconsiderate Needs
Gimme what I want! I don't care who bleeds
These days people ready to steal and rob
All in the name of I'm DOING MY JOB~!
But what about doing your work, what's your purpose?
No human being is worthless
Think about this before you pull the trigger
And you call your sister a bitch and your brother a - Whoa
Knowledge Reigns Supreme again, ignorance is weakenin
Truth is what I'm speakin' when I'm reachin' and teachin my friends
Life is more than just cars and lust
Unity is a must, we need to build trust
Open up your mind to this, raisin up your consciousness
Whether you a pessimist, strategist or optimist
My synopsis is knowledge ain't where college is
Knowledge is for leaders and wisdom is for philosophers
Now I'm hearin London gettin' violence like Brooklyn was
Brothers gettin' shot just for lookin' cause?
I thought we deaded that, we need to be headed back
Yo France, you need to be coverin your brother's back
Bring the lovin' back, cause the government don't love you
They into murder, money, and stayin above you
They want you all in prison
So before you kill your sister or brother stop and listen"

Stop shootin black people, we all gonna drop
You don't even get, paid a whole lot
So take your M-60 and put it 'pon lock!
Take your four-five and you put it 'pon lock!
Lookin' for your people when you walk down a block
Here in America you have drug spot
They get the black cop, to watch the drug spot
The black drug dealer just avoid black cop
They're killin' each other on a East Coast block
Killin' each other on a West Coast block
White police, don't give a care about dat
Dem want us killin' each other over crack
Anyway you put it it's a black on BLACK
Black cop black cop black cop
Black cop black cop black cop
Thirty years, there were no black cops
You couldn't even run, drive round the block
Recently police trained black cop
To stand on the corner, and take gunshot
This type of warfare isn't new or a shock
It's black on black crime again nonSTOP
Black cop! Black cop black cop
Black cop black cop black cop
""Don't be the sucker...
Don't be the sucker comin' into my face...
Don't be the sucker..""
Here's what the West and the East have in common
Both have black cops in cars profilin
Hardcore kids in the West got stress
In the East we are chased by the same black beast
The black cop is the only real obstacle
Black slave turned black cop is not logical
But very psychological, haven't you heard?
It's the BLACK COP killin' black kids in Johannesburg
Whassup black cop, yo, whassup?!
Your authorization says shoot your nation
You wanna uphold the law, what could you do to me?
The same law dissed the whole black community
You can't play both sides of the fence
1993 mad kids are gettin' tense
Black cop! Black cop black cop black cop
Stop shootin black people we all gonna drop
You don't even get, paid a whole lot
Take your four-five and you put it 'pon lock!
Take your M-60 and put it 'pon lock!

24,Bling Blung,2006,Life (2006),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Yeah, Word Up
Yeah
Yo
Bling blung, bling blung, First you see the bling
Then you feel the blung
This is the way that the world is run
Can't you tell
Bling blung rock the bells
Move along, move along, along, this is a newa song
KRS-One the supa strong
Move along before you lose your tongue
Before you lose ya lung
Be sure MCs get done
Detour or move along
We teach the young
How many young men hung so we could sing a song?
You need to move along, along, along
The string of injustice stung those that bling cause now they blung
Materialism stings and now they stung
You need to move along
Life is like ding, dong, ying, yang, bing, bang, ping, pong, or ping, pong
Any lyrical battle we won
Yes, this a master flow, this how life go on
First you got it then you're gone
So don't get stung
Cause after the bling it's blung
No material thing stays with you long
Move along, along, we can't get stung
We the one, my melanin stuns right up in the sun
I go and I come, don't mind me son
I'm just a teacher, them cats should't try me son
I'm that lively one
I roll with them grimey ones
At the Temple (of Hip Hop) you can find me son
What I bring and sing reflects what I brung
I be rolling, aling off the tongue
You can check them other ones
Maybe them younger ones
But I be that I witness just like Connie Chung
Some burn the paper
Some burn the bong
I'm burning rappers, I think you need to move along!
Move along you little singers
Never linger round a rhyme bringer
These rap blingers
I break you off a middle finger
Bell ringa, in your mind a dong dinga
Yo, that's what's wrong with these singas
When they sing all they bring is bling
They dummies
But after the bling aling, aling is blung
Post bling is blung
A new ting son
I'm rockin' these bells like ding dong
As you can see I got no rings on
Cause it got nothing to with what springs song
So ding dong
Open the door to freedom
Any of my books you should read dum and be strong
Or else you need to move along, along, along
Your lyrics are cow dung
There use to be a TV talent show with a gong
And when the gong gonged you were gone
Yes I am the lyrical Don
Beats for art um
But I am unattched to all of thum
The message of the song is bling blung
Don't get caught up in watcha bought up
Be Strong"

Hey baby bring me something to drink in here
Sit down and watch a little TV

Lately I feel it coming. I knew it, they comin'. (static) This just in.
President (static) I guarantee (static) Jim... Jimmy, Jimmy wake up. Jimmy!

Start to rock this mic (static) Now the polar bear hibernates (static) And
And what was going through your mind right now.
KRS-1:
Look aat these weak MC's getting G's
Never wore BVD's or even bellbottom Lees
Please, with these fantasies about you selling keys
When you know you bees in front of the TV eatin' grilled cheese
On your knees you know my steez
Kris is nice with theses M-I-Cs
I'm Poison like BBD the plot thickens while I be hittin
And lyric lickin', flippin' any mix and over the skippin'
And cable clippin', still sickenin'
Even though some people ain't admitting
Through they system I keeps it kickin'
And tippin' the scale I pay tuiton not bail
Drink water not ale, MC Hammer hits it right on the nail
I can't fail with my 7 stripes
Strike one pierces the lung over the drum MC's become dumb
Like ""um?"" They numb, bite the tongue over the bass drum
I am D the MC like Run, spittin' lyrics for fun
And for a sum of the bread crumb
You missed when you swung, I connected whole hum
Another one done underestimated KRS-1, yeah so...

Redman: You better cool the F out before we go up in your mouth
KRS-1:
It's just beguuuun, to bubble
KRS-Onnnne spells trouble
On the mic soooon there is no double
I emerge from under the rumble
Count the truth poetic construction, audio abduction
Showbiz production for wack lyric reduction
And fly rhyme instruction keep the party hoppin'
Keep the DJs buggin' for the orthodox
Non Xerox hip hop chatter box
It was dope first crack out the box with Scott LaRock
How MC's are washed up like sweat socks
KRS-1 makes the heads nod
Redman: KRS-1
KRS-!: Yes my son
Redman: Tweet tweet (x2)

Redman:
No doubt. You better cool the F out before we go up in your mouth
KRS-1:
When it's my turn kid, look at what you done did
Like my head is dreadable you edible
I kick incredible shit, for my poeple
I'm jackin' these like me so sue and Stretch like Bobbito overloops
While you sittin' on stoops I'm rockin' mics for U.S. troops in group
You screwed up, oops, I can read a true crook
Like I can read a good book
I'm hooked on hip hop culture
Look at the tip top lyrical structure
Floatin' like a soap bubble that you don't wann puncture
Or rupture, I write what I udder, mother mother mother
There's too many of us dying still trying and not doin'
Not succeeding still pursuing what you doing?
What you doing? What you doing?
The session is started departed on schedule
I beg you please look over my lyrical menu
What other can't do I can do
Enhancing 7 levels of your mental
I dismantle stress, you're listening to the advanced lyrical best

I'm at the end of my rope, I'm bout to snap
Cut a nigga throat, put a bullet through his hat
With his head attached
What's the deal new jack? Who dat? Got his chest blew back
Clak! Clak! Bullet through his teeth, nigga true that
You in my way, move that, Truck coming through that
Run up in your spot, come out, raising two gats
Move back, give a nigga room, let me hit this
Way back, since up in the womb, I was with this
Every sentence, we doom with consistence
Be the witness, let me spit this, Kris hit this
(KRS-One)
Yo... if it's all about the hundreds, let's try to get two 50s
Don't stop and switch a temple, let's work and build a city
You see the equation, to this whole situation?
If I'm the God of rap and you battling me, you Satan
And that's why you hating, creating debates
When you know damn well that your title will be taken
You think you all that son?
Bring it to the cypher!
You only got platinum?
Bring it to the cypher!
You think you got props son?
Bring it to the cypher!
You living Hip Hop son?
Bring it to the cypher!
(Verse Two: KRS-One)
Yo... daytime, nighttime, anytime, I got plenty time
To kick many rhymes, big time, all time
Taking it to you over time, so when I'm flowing rhymes
Bright I shine, simply 'cause I'm
Lyrically be kicking out the tighter rhyme, till I climb
Bring in the chime, in your mind, you fall behind
Picking up your rhyming skill, I am fulfilled, when I kill at will
Still number one for fun, kill another one
Battle your bugging son
Look I cut your tongue, KRS-One is never done
I am the proper one, this ass-whipping will make you better son
Go and tell your mum I took a bite out of your bum
Anytime you want it, doggone it, yo put me on it
Never running up on it, you never disappointed, get on it
I simply jam, not that I give a damn
Let me tell you who I am, just ask your buddy
Put your cash on Kris, I bet you double up your money
You can call me Chris Rock, ain't nothing funny
(Truck Turner)
Nigga what, let me change my style up, in a rough
Nigga duck, dropped your face, pick it up, shook 'em up
Automatic fire - Brrrrrrrruh! Brrrrrrrruh!
All up in the party, clip it out, give it up
(KRS-One)
Where's the money for this single, get it out, give it up
Blastmaster's coming through Truck, what
(Verse Three: Truck Turner)
That night I let the fo'-fo' bark, spark right off the dark
Body parts chalked, where we live, how we get down
Come up on my block making noise, keep the shit down
I cripple you, pull up a wheelchair, permanent sit-down
Perfect fit now, now clown, who the shit now?
Fo'-fo' aimed at your dome, bout to spit rounds
Me and you, getting it on? Don't even go there
Once I bring it to you, you won't be save nowhere
Oh yeah, your mom's funeral don't even show there
It'll be a double burial dukes, when the smoke clears
Love you like a brother, but I'll kill you if you rally
Stay on my good side, my bad side, I annihilate
Don't hold me back, get off me, told these kats never cross me
But they crossed the line, I gotta show 'em
My fo'-fo' snub is what I owe 'em, Kris you know him? (Nah)
Ice pick, adequate style, I'm bout to blow him
Dudes get trifle, catch the barrel of the rifle
Fuck you, until more niggaz looking just like you
Don't toot, when you hear me squeeze off the cycles
I squeeze you load (I squeeze you reload)
I squeeze you reload till this whole shit can roll
Where I'm from, that's the code, BDP got your shit sold
Like bad heads that fold at war, anything goes

Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO
Brown skin woman you a queen and not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO
Verse One:
We don't come with disrespect, we come with intellect
If you come with disrespect you get a rope around your neck
Some people don't expect me, to be so violent
But me NAH violent, just myself I protect
Too many time I see, young gwal pickadee
Pay five ten twenty thirty dollar to see
Some rapper some singer some ... celebrity
Talk bout they wan fi sex up and fill up you body
But them NAH talk about peelin off some money
For the pumpin onna bed, when you haf the baby
Whattaya think can happen next? After you're done havin' sex?
Too much of ignorance, not enough intellence
Mahn me NOT against sex, but too many DJ
Talk sex but them not talk about the next day
Cause the next day them gone, and you sit alone
Got 'em soup up your mic, pon de micraphone
Chorus (w/ minor variations)
Verse Two:
Brown skin gwal them can't diss yo
Cause you run the show-ow-ow!
Them call you all type of bimbo
But you know you're not a hoe-oe-oe!

Brown man is a God in any ci-ty
White, man knew dat, and dat was a shock
So dem whip up your bod', and dem whippin not stop
But dem NAH can't stop us wit de whip and de chain
So dem take away your history, erase your name
STILL, with no name, with no fight, with no fuss
We just, take on the name, that MASSA give us
That name is NI-GGA, the correct is NE-GRO
It's spa-nish for BLACK, white mahn call us DAT
There is also NE-GROID, also NE-GRO
Now, all nigga pon the corner playin' cee-lo
Man you're not a ne-gro, 'cause you're skin is not black
Take a look at yourself, you're brown and that's a fact
You not jump from no tree, you not live in no cave
That's some GARBAGE dem print, dem want you to behave!
You a African man, some say Asian
You must respect your love, all brown skin 'oman!
If you diss your 'oman, you not come wit no plan
So shut up your mowf, till you must understand!

I know you want me to call you a nigga... NO!

Rapper get kicked in they mouth with cleets
'Cause they're speech refuses to reach beyond the beach
Have a seat quick I speak or spit flicks on your ???
Time to complete shit, no weak shit, I mean freak shit properly
I can feel myself becoming a lyric monopoly
Others will copy me but repeat my shit sloppily
Shocking me with inclinations of rocking me
Insanity it got to be
My true idenity is never meant to see
I simply use the gifts sent to me mentally

Yo! Word up! Get from out my face, before you get bust quickly!
Verse two: KRS-One

Even when it's snowing I'm party going
Free flowing and stomping!
Never tip-toeing
Overthrowing the comp
Big up Bronx!
I got more styles than the planet got women
I got as many rhymes as is many styles of women
Don't make me come out on that ass start flippin'
Your mental I'm afflictin'
Actin' ill and sickin'
Pickin' the victim at random, slammin' 'em
Draggin' them to the stage and dismantlin' them
As my Hydrogen turns to Helium I shine!
None of your lyrics I'm feelin' 'em
You rhyme
Like you should be wearin' an apron scrapin' a pot with a name like Mariam
But rappers talk too much shit
And can't back it up with lyrics
Build ya skills
It's time for the raw shit
Not that on tour shit
That real hardcore shit
KRS-One runs shit like diarrhea
Bitin' motherfuckers hear my shit and get up outta here!
I don't care this year
Alot of albums is wak this year
""Will KRS bring it?"" Ah yeah!
Thanks for the invite
It's just about to get hype
That straight up raw street type shit is what it feel like
I will be displayin' lyrical styles I'm saying
Lyrical styles from the miracle child
Want a pile of ill styles wildin' on your radio dial?
Smile
I been here for awhile
Peep my style while I go on with the song
I rock the microphone then it to the streets with the Krylon
Clicka clacka! clicka clacka!
Take a spraycan and slap a wak rapper!
Stacks of money for videos I don't have it
You're lookin' at the last MC with true talent
Get your tape recorder fast kid
Boombastic another classic
Turn up the cassette!
All my styles are lyrically fantastic and movin'
While soothin' any urges for booing
Ungluing your mouth from my private
The more the merrier
Syllable superior
East coast- West Coast battles are inferior
'Cause I by myself will take out the whole North America
We need to expand rap beyond this land
Set up competitions with England and Japan
World cups for rappers that really fuck shit for fun

Open a de herb gate sellin pure ganja
Babylon come but they undercova
They never really want me stop sell ganja
(They just wanna take a cut of what you make so far!)
But I'm not havin' it, I load the SLR
Pack the ganja BOOM! They break down the door
Pop-pop! T'ree shots, exchanged at close range
Out of three Babylon, me hit one in the brain
Pop-pop! Two shots hit da window pane
I exchanged four shots, I drop and feel pain
But I'm not hit, into the bathroom I crawl
I look out the window, it's a one story fall
I'm fallin', hit the ground and start crawlin
Soon I'm walkin' 'round, blendin in with the crowd
Another day, I got away, I gotta fix this problem someday
But the very next day...

I'm in another herb gate like a superstar
Eleven A.M., things are safe so far
I used to worry 'bout the competition on the block
But now the competition on the block is the cops
And even block watch doesn't know where we lay
Well... (""Open up! It's the D.E.A.!"")
Aww man, just when I went for more lead
The door opens up, I got a glock to my forehead
(""Get down! Get on the floor!"") I felt the stick, I thought I was dead
But I woke up instead in a cell layin on my bed
I lay back down, then I heard the crack sound
Two D.T.'s came in and laid they glocks down
One was whistlin a love song, as he put some gloves on
I thought to myself, damn something's wrong
Boom bap! Boom ba, p against my head
I fell back on the bed, down to his feet
The pain was insane but the hit was sweet
Cause these dumb-ass cops punched me right by the heat
The glock, two shots, three shots they screamin
Then someone said... (""Hey wake up kid, you're dreamin'!"")
I said, ""Yo dreamin'?! That nightmare was hell""
But as I look around, I was still in my cell
Damn, I got myself caught up in a jam
The D.T. that woke me up was like, WHAT?!
I wiped the saliva, off my mouth
The D.T. said... (""Let's make a deal"") No doubt!
No question, now we started up the session
No need for guessin, yes they want my supplier
I said, what makes you think there's anyone higher?
He said... (""Don't be a God damned liar!"")
You killed three D.T.'s yesterday, you heard me
But still the cops you knocked off yeah was dirty
Now the whole investigation is federal
We want you to point out, the rest of the cops that are criminal
He continued to say, you can't think it through
This whole drug game is BIGGER than you!
Follow our plan man and you'll be free
Let me explain one thing so you can see, we
(KRS-One)
Now I'm back in the herb gate, all wired up
Constantly thinkin' about bein tied up
Snap out of it - I'm thinkin', ""Damn we like elves!
The federal and local cops got wars with themselves;
And I'm in the middle, and can't solve the riddle.
My nose is runny.."" {*knock at door*} (""Let me get a 20!"")
A 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown?
(""Gimme the whole pound, clown, or duck down!"") {*gunfire*}
God damn, God damn, here we go again
But this time I'm set up by my federal friend
Suddenly I hear... (""Yo, move from the door!"") {*two shots*}
Followed by the shot sounded like a four-four {*two shots*}
After the violence, then there was silence
Then I heard... (""Hey yo it's us, open up the door!"")
But rule number one in this game is self-reliance
So I picked up the mini-mac in case they wanted more
The door opened up, the feds said WHATTUP?
They was stickin you up, so they had to get bucked
Suddenly a sense of trust came over me
I thought to myself, ""Well soon I'll be free!""
But as I turned around, I heard the gun go click {*clik-clak*}
I said wait, but it was too late - {*GUNSHOT*}"

So they fired up, up and away

Yeah, yeah
Hardcore lyric comin' at ya they attackin ya
Rappers bite like Dracula the soul of hip-hop
I'm puttin' back in ya, with the South Bronx vernacular
Bound to put the crack in your armor, I am much sharper
Than a lot of other mic rockers, slightly eccentric
But everything's authentic, when I said, ""I'm hip-hop,"" I meant it
Emcees wanna debate the issue, but false though
If they studied they would see that they are hip-hop also
Hip-Hop you can't do it, you gots to be it
You can't confine it, you have to free it, so you can see it
As your expression, and learn the lesson, on life in ghetto sections
And what you feel is the forward direction
For black people, not these Star Wars save that for R2-D2
I got five fingers like Bruce Lee do
And with the five fingers I grab microphones and bring the
Stinger to DJ's, rappers, singers and beer drinkers
This MC's a thinker, unlike others but I won't diss yaz
You're still my brothers and sisters, Kris is
ONE aspect of hip-hop rap
Negative rap, positive rap, forget that black it's a trap
To set us back, concentrate on various rap talents
Presently the rap radio format is unbalanced
You either got the player, or the conscious rhyme sayer
All day, on your radio, not with a different flavor
Someone has to DIE before you hear a conscious record
People don't like gangsta rap, but conscious rap, they don't respect it
The truth is people are afraid of black youth
Our expressions, our lessons and gold teeth, so...

The love I give to you, you give to me
Let's come together once and for all
Before our children cannot walk in the mall
Before we cannot talk or walk at all already aviation is stalled
Now everybody wants to drive, bringing our highways to a crawl
Just about three weeks on back
I was talking to a journalist about my album, the sneak attack
Now I know, why I felt that way
Why the cards God revealed to me was dealt that way
Be prepared for the unexpected, that was the theme
But if your booty's shaking, you can't know what that means
Look, we all, in the, same, game
It's that world bank game that got struck with two flame
But we, yes the people, are struck with true pain
'Cause the world Bank'll do the same under a new name
We gotta recognize the prize and the people at the door
No more lies, you can no longer ignore
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me
I know
(Know what?)
I know
(What you know?)
What do I show?
(What you show?)
Captivating lyrical flow
(They don't play it on radio)
Yeah, but the spirit know
But only a few can hear it though
The metaphysical lyrical blow
The minute you're in it and hear it, yo
See the evil and clear it, yo
See that for as many that died there was twice as many miracles
Uh, so let the dead bury their dead
Life is but a dream and in the dream we gotta get ready for bed
Better we look ahead instead, to the ones that survived
Pray for them too, 'cause there grace of God kept them alive
Yes, we mourn for the dead and will still kill for them
But what about the injured that must still rebuild again?
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me
To all the people, that never lost someone
Consider the cost of the loss of a lost daughter or son
These cowards slaughter and run
And to know that there's more than just one
Makes you wanna store up your gun
And withdraw all the funds, but
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victorya
The love I give to you, you give to me
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've gotta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me"

Thou knowest not what thou sayeth in speech?
Doth thou know what thou teacheth to each?
From thine own mouth, thy corrupt thine own house
Thy corrupt thine siblings and thine own spouse
Satan has hold of thy spirit
So evil has hold of thy lyric
Whomsoever shall hear it shall adapt it
And walk the talk of evil just as ye rapped it
But I cometh forth today to say thus
Evil is an illusion, in GOD we trust
In Satan we lust
Coveting thy brother's vehicle while riding the bus
Feeling unjust
Trust not sinners in the flesh they aren't winners
But in the spirit they art children, beginners
Eat not of the dinner they serve
Seek the experienced MC, not the beginners in word"

But when you drop to three everybody want to see

But when you drop to five people will help you strive
When you drop to six you still in every mix
But when you drop to seven people start guessin
When you drop to eight people hesitate
But when you drop to nine that's when you start to find
That when you drop to ten you start to lose your friends
When you drop to eleven your record stop sellin
When you drop to twelve it's everyone for themselves
So when you drop to thirteen you stop working
When you drop to fourteen no more self esteem
You drop to fifteen 'cause you lived and you seen
When you drop to sixteen you now out the scene
When you drop to seventeen you see things you never seen
Like when you drop to eighteen you know what it mean
So drop to nineteen and on then to twenty
At nineteen you lose your honey
At twenty your money to a Playboy bunny
At twenty one things ain't funny
At twenty two you don't know what to do
So you hit twenty three you look for security
So you drop to twenty four no more can you endure
When you drop to twenty five at the bottom you've arrived
When you drop to twenty six you in a old school mix
When you drop to twenty seven until you start steppin
When you drop to twenty eight you start to meditate
When you drop to twenty nine you expand your mind
When you drop to thirty you see it was all dirty
No you drop to thirty two and it occurs to you
When you hit thirty three now you can see

The God of your understanding, has chosen you and you've agreed
To be here in this space and time to do something, that only you can do
Now I won't stand here to try and tell you what it is
But deep, inside yourself
As you take time to uncover, and ask yourself some vital questions
Like - what is it that brings me peace, what is it that brings me joy?
What do I love doing?
What am I willing to become highly skilled at doing?
What part can I play for the betterment of the society
And the world in which I want to live?
When you begin to ask yourself those real questions
And it doesn't have to be done in a formal way
It can be done just like we're speaking, right now
Ask yourself the question
Look at how you see yourself in just a year from now
And then go forward
And if you have children or even if you don't have children
Now begin to, look at your future beyond
The space and time that you are
Now visualize exactly, the way that you desire to live
Don't be afraid to, dream"

Okay now, listen to this...
{*Sound effect: seagulls*}
A mystical teacher sat by the seaside
It was about five o'clock 'cause we heard the free ride
Anyway; the teacher was talking in stride
Sitting upon a rock that was wide
And warning against false pride
""Come to where I reside!"" a woman cried
And the teacher replied, ""Do you serve your fish fried?""
""Yes,"" she replied, ""with potato salad on the side.""
And the teacher replied, ""Well where do you reside?""
She said, ""Up on the hillside, it's not a far ride.
If you came to have dinner, I would be so gratified.""
The teacher replied, ""It's six o'clock, seven o'clock, you decide.""
She replied, ""Seven o'clock, do you like stir-fried?""
She was mystified and felt so dignified
The teacher was coming to the house where she resides
So she purified with pesticides
{*Sound effect: chemicals sprayed*}
Called her friends up nationwide
{*Sound effect: phone being dialed*}
Some of her friends were tongue-tied they felt so glorified
She made steamed fish, baked fish, fish that was fried
Soup, steamed vegetables, potato salad on the side
{*Sound effect: food cooking*}
You could smell the bread in the oven far and wide
Natural juices and water purified
Organic fruits brought from the countryside
With silver forks and knives placed side by side
{*Sound effect: silverware clinks*}
You could not be dissatisfied;
Looking out the window staring at the mountainside,
You would have died
6:59 she's swollen with pride
As the moment intensified, there's a knock from outside
{*Sound effect: door knocking*}
She opens the door, for the teacher has arrived
{*Sound effect: door creaks open*}
But to her surprise, it was a bum who cried
""Please, I smelt the bread from outside!
One piece,"" and then she replied
""The teacher is coming, he's soon to have arrived.
You're making me look bad, come on now, step aside!""
The bum then replied,
""When I say I'm hungry I haven't lied.
Give me some of that chicken that you just fried.""
{*Sound effect: food cooking*}
She replied, ""Chicken - fried?
No that's for the teacher, you're not purified""
Then she slammed the door and went back inside
{*Sound effect: door closes*}
Sat on the couch with the TV Guide
She looked at the clock, it was 7:09, then 7:30;
He still hasn't arrived
Eight o'clock, she's on the downside
Nine o'clock, by now she's teary-eyed
She's pissed off and her anger multiplied
She cried, then fell asleep dissatisfied
Next day she woke up, and was preoccupied
With meeting the mystical teacher who lied
Where could he hide?
She ran down by the seaside
{*Sound effect: seagulls*}
He was there teaching about - false pride
""You lied!"" she replied, ""You lied!
You said you'd be there at seven o'clock, you lied!""
He replied, ""No I have not lied.
I came at 6:59, and you told me to move aside.
I asked for bread and the chicken that was fried.
{*Sound effect: food cooking*}
And you said, that I wasn't purified.""
She replied, ""I wasn't notified!
I had no idea that you was the bum that cried!""
And the teacher sighed, then replied,
""This concludes our lesson on false pride."""

I mean, rockin' it live, not pickin' his cotton
I mean, adjustin his clothes I mean, how do you know
Before you come to the show, and you're not gettin' cheated
That you're not gettin' heated, that you ain't come to the club
Thinkin', ""Uh-uh - I must have been weeded!""
You got to be a educated consumer
Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya
All they want is your cash, ass, glass, gas and a flick
When you ask for that autograph, they ass dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we BUST OFF the gatler
He's more of an actor, someone, into theater
Not an upright MC with styles who speaks clearer!

That when they trust to look back on us there was no dope MC's

But judge not, lest ye may be judged

But tell me, who blew up Oklahoma?
The City, ain't no pity, for the beast
It's Hakim that voice from the East
Verse Three: KRS, Hakim, Tuffy
Buck buck! Buck buck buck!
It sound like gunshots but it could be the plot
Of a chicken, definition, is what you're missin' and
Listen to your children instead of dissin em
Senator Dole doesn't understand the young people
Like they be sayin' want to, but we be sayin' wanna
They gettin' dumber every summer as they walk the rope
Maybe because they cannot understand the quotes
Word, in actuality, this Norman Bates mentality
Always seems to represent, minus three-sixty percent
For degrees full circle, dead from the purple
Rays of the sun I gots melanin so check it
Bag your nuts quick or get sick from being naked
Suspect it, was it a means for the end
For just a few to drive the Benz while you eat the pigskins
Turned you into mannequins, cause the trick of technology
A revelation, revalations
Sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
That's my solution, there will be no sequels
I'm audi hundred forty four thousand with my people
From Caligula to Hitler, now it's Schwartzeneggar
A lust for the violence is the science of their behavior
Who enslaved ya (it's the Devil) but the God of virtuosity
And of the world created, could it be mental sodomy
Got my mind twisted like the blades of fonta leaf
I sit in disbelief as he crawls underneath
The rock cock back the glock, 'cause I don't trust
The Devil I rebel until Babylon is dust"

They talkin' but the conversation ain't goin' nowhere
You can't diss hip-hop, so don't you even go there
C. Delores Tucker, you wanna quote the scripture
Everytime you hear nigga, listen up sista
Verse One: Hakim, KRS, Tuffy
I met up with this girl named Delores, a prankster
I said I MC, she said, ""You're a gangster""
But she was caught up, she hit the floor like a breakdance
Wrapped her up like the arms in a b-boy stance
Recognize moms I'm one of your sons I'm hip-hop
In the form of Channel Live and KRS-One
Representin MC's across America
She said, ""You're the one who be causin all that mass hysteria""
Wisdom shall come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
But you blinded by cultural ignorance and steady judging
But judge not, lest ye may be judged
For the judgment ye judge ye shall surely be judged, you gets no love
She said, ""I like it, that's why I jock it""
Then I said, ""You only on my back because I fill brother's pockets""
Got 'em drivin' Benzes Jeeps and Rolls Royces
Attackin me will leave youth with no voices
The choice is yours not mine hang with me
I'll have you freestyle and bombin graffiti
We can cut it up like like wax
Claimin I cause violence but America was violent before rap, FACT

Instead of fighting them why don't you go free Mumia

Verse Two: Tuffy, KRS, Hakim
Wild recital, I kicks the vital, like the Final
Call as I watch, Babylon fall
I had to Rush Limbaugh, get that pig with an axe
Tuffy dips to the side, buckin cannons that's phat
Because he censors the uses of the metaphor
You can get the dick bum up
Because it's you that brings the, real horrorcore
Expenditures forgettin, gut from the poor
Why sure! Back before we were born they sold us out
Yeah Dade Jackson we know what you about
Youse a Slave Mason, not a Free Mason
Before long the Goddess Tiamat through hip-hop you'll be facin
Don't start me, 'cause I be the, lyricist
At the nineteen ninety-nine millennium party held at Giza
Sayin' he's a, fraud, oh my Goddess
Never in your life should you disrespect an artist
Instead, focus your attention on astronomy
And the up and coming, shift in the economy
If you can't do that, then heed the final call
To free Mumia, Abu-Jamal
Hate to be so rough, it could be the White Owls
House niggaz are full of crap, like my Colin Powell
Kickin vowels, is how we relieve the tension

What is a real hip-hop MC?
Is it MTV, is it BET?
Is it five m-i-c's
So the people can see
I mean, how you think you're free
When you act like property?
Tell me, how do you judge an MC when he's rockin'
I mean rockin' it live, not pickin' his cotton
I mean adjustin his clothes, I mean how do you know
Before you come to the show that you're not gettin' heated
That you're not gettin' cheated
That you ain't come to the club thinkin' 'I must've been weeded!'
(Word)
You got to be a educated consumer
Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya
Ass they want is your cash, ass, grass, gas in a flick
When you ask for that autograph they ass-dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we bust off the gatler
This is the ""Sneak Attack""
The ""Edutainment"" style returns like that
Take it off your shelf
Cause all we deal with is knowledge of self, health and wealth
Not Stealth bombers, leather goose bombers
Original hip-hop armor on CD-rom - eh
You got to get with a
21st century philosopher
Representin the religion of hip-hop, sir
Those that oppose are foes and will get rocked - eh
Stopped, eh - I rise like a helicopter
Like Zulu I'll Shaka, crowd
With a beat that's loud
Huh, I'm black and I'm proud - irrelevant
I'm black and intelligent
I teach my kids to watch the education they give em
'Cause it's really all about street wisdom
True hip-hoppers don't bleed
True hip-hoppers don't need
True hip-hoppers don't speed
No time for greed
True hip-hoppers do read
And will lead, not plead
Will sow seeds that breed
Ah-ha that's safer than weed, indeed
True hip-hoppers don't slave
True hip-hoppers don't crave
Silver and gold, we're not amazed
We live f-r-e-e
If you not into lyrics you can't really hear it nor see me
My philosophy keeps it plain and simple
Here it is: the kingdom of hip-hop is within you
Or is it the kingdom of hell that sends you?
I'm ringin' a bell within you
You only seek in a cell, that's what sin do
It tells you to put your craft on a menu, a chart
So they can sell you and your art"

I must give up the streets you lift the company can sell me

You could sell a million records, and still can't set it
Cause the Lex or Beem is probably just the matches and a Jeep so
I'm sure your rap career now if they come before your people
Oh Lord! You can't be thinkin' about Billboard

Being dope live is like being insured for life
You always get called back twice, you are

You know, this rap music ex-specially for SO... LONG... SO... LONG""
I said, ""Well you know years ago I made a deal with the Goddess""
He said, ""The Goddess?""
I said, ""Well yeah, you might know her as God
But I know her as the Goddess""
The universal mother
The mother of everything you see in existence
I ax-ked her for assistance
In lyrical persistence
And she gave it to me, under one condition
She said, ""I'll give you the gift
But use the gift to uplift""
I said, ""Okay mom!""
So I tell you the truth, really
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
In the beginning was the word, the word was made flesh
Knowledge K. Reigns R. Supreme S.
Some of us guess while others of us are blessed
Take heed to the word, that I manifest
I manifest the future, the present, followed by the past
Everything in nature, rules by kickin ass
What they tellin' me, but yo, you a friend to me
So I'ma tell you the secrets of MC longevity
Secret one: if it ain't fun, you're done
And about your career, huh, well choose another one
If you don't like what you do, you're through
Lesson two: make sure you got a dope crew
Not some crew, that's like an anchor on a shoe
A MAD CREW, that's of some benefit to you
Lesson three, might be contradictory or funny
But MC's should have OTHER WAYS of gettin' money
That's to say learn other things beside music
Make money elsewhere, Hip-Hop you won't abuse it
Too many MC's, just emcee
So their longevity, is based on an Uncle Tom
At the record company
Lesson four: sell your image, never sell a record
Image is respected, records come and go
And get collected
Even the records of platinum artists, that used to rip shop
Can be bought, for a quarter at the thrift shop
Which brings me to lesson number five, the illusion
Has me thinkin', the minute they drop a record
They'll be cruisin, in the Acura
Slow down! You're still a amateur
What separates the pro from the amateur is stamina
Not how long you can rhyme, but how long you've been rhymin
Changin with the times, and findin yourself
Still CLIIIIIIIIIIIIMbin for wealth
Blow for blow, you're still growin', still showin
(All knowin') now that's a pro at it
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Thank you Mother, I'm out"

To make you hibernate sooner, certified luna-tic

Kahunas, raw for the able key movers
All over the hood like them Crooked I coolers
Bang maneuvers, from Jerz to Vancouver
Back to the Bronx with heartbeats ample looped up

Like a phone chauvinist with a Roley on the wrist

58,Higher Level,1993,Return of the Boom Bap (1993),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Verse One:
After seven years of rockin'
How do you rate me?
Poorly or greatly?
Everybody seems to be goin' for their's lately
Yo mad heads be needin' money
So listen very close as I conduct this little study
See it's, funny to me, you can watch TV
And give up your life trying to be all you can be
In the Army
Not knowin' your history
You either fight and die or come back home in misery
Yo get with me, I deal with reality
Loosen your mind to the truth, and don't get mad at me
No politician can give you peace
If you trust Jesus, why do you vote for a beast?
Emancipation is long over due
So overcome procrastination
Because freedom is within you
For some reason we think we're free
So we'll never be
Because we haven't recognized slavery
You're still a slave, look at how you behave
Debatin' on where and when and how and what Massa gave
You wanna know how we screwed up from the beginning?
We accepted our opressor's religion
So in the case of slavery it ain't hard
Because it's right in the eyes of THEIR God
Where is our God, the God that represents us?
The God that looks like me, the God that I can trust?
A God of peace and love, not mass hysteria
I don't want a God that blesses America
I could never really vote for the devil
Let me take you to a higher level...
Verse Two:
Title, take the title from the Bible we can get there
Rip the title from off the front of the Bible, God don't live there
Too many inconsistencies, too many mysteries
Picture the Pope and the Vatican, laughing and drinking and singing and
Kissing me
I stand with God whether I'm paid or whether I'm cryin' broke
I like to ask these politicians would Jesus vote?
The way we view God is a freakin' shame
Church is to blame
We trust God, but bomb Hussein
We simply lovin' the scripture
Same scripture that whipped 'cha
Sooner it'll hit 'cha
Religion's gettin' richer
With that European version of Christ made into a picture
Our society's gettin' sicker, and sicker, and sicker...
Like liquor, we are God-Intoxicated
Not to the true God, but the one the government created
The same governments tellin' people to vote
I pray to God because the people have lost hope
You either vote for the mumps or the measels
Whether you vote for the lesser of two evils, you vote for evil
Politics and God are not equal
But the education if you don't guard, is really lethal
People have more respect for a holy book
Than they do for a cow on a meat hook
Belivers of Jesus be denouncing Satan on every level
But every Halloween they're dressin' like devils
I pray to you for the light you might give them
Mother make them know that you're livin' with them
You begin them and end them in silence
Frankly, if they knew you, they would understand violence
I pray to you for the Pope and the Vatican
Have mercy Mother, 'cause I know that you're mad at them
The White Jesus deceived us awhile ago
And Pope Julius the Second paid Michaelangelo
I know this happened in 1519 yet
This is the image we can't seem to forget
Vote for God, don't vote for the Devil
Let me take you to a higher level..."

If you don't repeat the actions of your own success
You won't be successful
You gotta know your own formula, your own ingredients
What made you, YOU...
1987 I was at the Latin Quarters
Listenin to Afrika Bambaata give the order
The call of the order was to avoid the slaughter
He said, ""Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya!""
Without a lawyer, he taught The Infinity Lessons
In how hip-hop could be a, many a blessing
And that was great, so in 1988
There was no debate, we had to end the hate
The name of the game was ""Stop the Violence""
And unity, knowledge, and self-reliance
We - started talkin' bout Martin and Malcolm
Had these ghetto kids goin', ""Huh, what about him?""
1989, Professor Griff speaks his mind
But his freedom of speech is declined
1990 came with the West coast
East coast, West coast, who is the best coast?
Lookin' back now, of COURSE it was bogus
The whole argument was where we lost focus
We got hopeless; not with the lyrics and music
But with hip-hop, and how we used it
Or abused it, you know how the crew get
""You like it cause you choose it""
1991, we opened our eyes
With Human Education Against Lies, we tried
To talk about the state of humanity
But all these others rappers got mad at me
They called me ""Captain Human"", another message was sent
""Self Destruction don't pay the {fuckin} rent""
Remember that? Nobody wanted conscious rap
It was like - where these ballers at?
Where can they call us at? All was wack
Hip-Hop culture was fallin' flat and that was that
So in 1992, I found my crew
They said, ""Yo Kris, what you wanna do?""
I said, ""Damn - why they wanna get with me?
If I bust they {shit} I'm contradictory.
If I play the bitch role, they take my shoe.
Tell me what the {fuck} am I supposed to do?""
So I did it, don't stop get it get it get it
All of a sudden these critics they wanna spit it
""Kay Are Ess One is con-tra-dic-to-ry""
Just 'cause I wouldn't let these rappers get with me
{Fuck} that, {fuck} you and {fuck} your pen
If a rapper wanna diss, yo I'd do it again
But I'm makin' these ends, and I got my friends
And I really don't wanna have to sit in the pen
So I go back to the philosopher
1993 hip-hop is uh... wack
Go back, check the facts
1994, ""Return of the Boom Bap""
It wasn't all about the loot
It was all about Harry Allen Rhythm Cultural Institute
Blowin' up, 1995
Conscious rap is still alive
But nobody wanna play it, nobody wanna say it
Nobody okayed it, they'd all rather hate it
1996 it really don't stop
We put together somethin' called the Temple of Hip-Hop
Not just DJin, breakin, graf and lyrics
But how hip-hop affects the spirit
""Step Into a World,"" that's what I did
1997 I was raisin my kid
Or kids, but I, had to go
Cause New York DJ's changed the flows
To clothes and hoes, but that wasn't me
I'll be damned if I dance for the MTV
So in 1998 I began to debate
Should I go now, or should I really wait?
'99, I moved to L.A. you see
And took a gig with the WB
Started studyin philosophy full-time
To have a full heart, full body, full mind
But you know what the problem is or was?
DJ's don't raise our kids, 'cause
They so caught up in the cash and jewels
How they gonna really see a hip-hop school?
How they gonna really see a hip-hop temple?
They don't even wanna play my instrumentals, but
Big up Dr. Dre, Snoop, Xzibit
Especially Xzibit, he was there in a minute
Mic Conception, all of them, said
""Yo you need help? I should call them""
When I was in L.A., I held the crown
Bloods, Crips, they held me down
I could never forget Mad Lion, killer pride
With the gat in the lap in the low-ride
Oh I can't forget, Icy Ice, Lucky Lou
Julio G, that was the crew
Davey D, Ingrid, David Connor
The list goes on and on, let me tell ya
FredWreck, and my man Protest
Much respect, no less
To my spiritual and mental defenders
Big up to L.A., temple members
But in 2000, I seen how I wanted to live
I wasn't no executive
So I picked up the mic and I quit my job
Said to Simone I gotta get with God
She said, ""Don't worry bout these dollars and quarters.
Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya.""
Damn, she took me back to Bam!
Took me back to who I am!
Brought me back to the New York land!
Now I overstand!..

Now KRS-One, now you've been quoted as saying that
Rap is something we do, hip-hop is something you live.
{KRS} Yes!
{Interviewer}
Explain that to us please.
{KRS-One}
Well, well, today hip-hop, we are advocating that hip-hop is not,
Just a music, it is an attitude, it is an awareness, it is a way
To view the world. So rap music, is something we do, but HIP-HOP,
Is something we live. And we look at hip-hop, in it's 9 elements;
Which is breaking, emceeing, graffiti art, deejaying, beatboxing,
Street fashion, street language, street knowledge, and street
Entrepenurialism - trade and business. And uh, that's where y'know
That's the hip-hop that that that we're about. We come from the uh
The root of, of Kool DJ Herc, who originated hip-hop in the early 70's
And then Afrika Bambaata and Zulu Nation (mmhmm)
Who instigated something called The Infinity Lessons
And added consciousness to hip-hop, and then Grandmaster Flash
With the invention of the mixer, on to Run-D.M.C. and then myself.
And uh, we created the ""Stop the Violence"" movement, you may recall
A song, ""Self Destruction"" and and and so on. All of this, goes to
Uh uh, the idea of LIVING this culture out and taking responsibility
For how it looks and and acts in society."

I call around for work but they puttin' me on hold
But in my hand a shiny .45 is what I hold
I make a mayonnaise sandwich out of some whole-
Wheat, I'm feelin' weak, I can't hold
I gotta rob somebody tonight and take the whole
Bank roll, some cash I gotta hold
At the bottom of my shoe is a little bitty hole
That's it, my mental sanity I can't hold
I'm walkin' to the store with this pistol that I hold...
Yeah... yeah...
Half of me is sayin' maintain and uphold
Suddenly I bump into some asshole
He's cursin' me out, but this pistol that I hold
Took control, and in his head I put a hole
Ah man, now I'm lookin' around the whole
Area, the gun is still hot that I hold
I'm buggin' out, and I don't know how much longer I can hold
I feel myself sinkin' deeper in the hole
So in my victim's pants I rip a little hole
And felt for the wallet, and took the whole
Bill-fold, forty bucks is what I hold
Suddenly I hear, ""Freeze! Police! Hold!""
Yeah... mmmmm...
Come on!
Yeah... wooh!
Come on...
In the penitentiary I see a whole
Bunch of blacks and Hispanics that they hold
In my cell I cry like hell, my head I hold
One day somebody ax if my shoes they could hold
I told this guy, ""Listen! My shoe's got a hole
But what's up with that shiny sharp knife that you hold?""
He lunged forth, the first thing that I thought of was to hold
The arm with the knife so that he couldn't put a hole
In me, but then I put him in a chokehold
Took the knife and in his neck I put a hole
Suddenly all the C.O's come to me and it's me they hold
Beat my ass and I spend two weeks in the hole
I'm ready to bug out, my sanity I can't hold
My needs and wants messed up my life on a whole.
Damn. Just wasn't satisfied with life.
Yeah... uh!

Wants is what causes problems in your life. Make sure you got whatcha

I fly through the hood like chicken wings do
Like a chef Marley likes mixin' things too
We came together just to change the weather
Busy Bee, he made this game remember?
These unoriginal rap flows, I don't speak those
Too many rappers just copy like Kinko's
Dressin' like they from office depot
Tryin' to be CEO's with whack weak flows
I teach those that flow how to be better
I train MC's to gain in any endeavor
But if you tryin' to diss, you'll get dismissed from the class
In other words, I'm kickin' yo' ass
Beats, bars and breaks, really that's it

Yo, my man, how bad do you want it?
You know how many cats I threw the pitch, and they never caught it?
I told them to bring they lyric, but they never brought it
Scared to get ripped off, cheated, deleted, rejected and shorted?
Yo, how bad do you want it?
FearóI ain't got no time for it
If you want it, yo there's the trackóput your rhyme on it!
(Peedo)
This hunger inside of me's unexplainable, Kris
The struggle we put in this box will be put into disc
Birth and ever, these family problems is hurtin'
Both of my sisters is pregnant, fuckin' feel like murkin'
All I have is my word and my balls
And my fam and my music speaks for them all
It's the Dominican animal ready to damage, you puttin'
Pressure to rappers that think they can challenge you, Kris (uh huh)
We been through it all, the grimiest days, this earth ain't
Ready for my brain, comin' to face (word)
Everyone plus everyone
Do you hear me, KRS-One?
(KRS)
Well listen
You grimy and hungry?
But how long you gonn' trust me?
You really down for this cause or just chasin' the money?
I be up in them spots to be hot, so dusty and ugly
Nothin' be funny, it's all dark, nothin' sunny
Can you walk with me? Talk with me? Pop the cork with me?
When we in other cities, will you rep New York with me? (yeah!)
I need respect and honor
Discipline and no drama
How bad you want it, poppa? (with all my)
(Peedo)
Loyalty is the key to it all (remember)
Get used to my face, we the winners of all
By mi gente, yo I go low to say-ah
Real like them Washington Heights
Niggaz there (say yeah!)
(KRS)
After you rap, will you stab my back? (never)
You gimme a track, will you take that back? (never)
I give the word, yo you bustin' your Gatt? (whatever)
Respect from your crew? They livin' like that? (they better)
This is no game! Why should I make you popular?
You know I'm the philosopha
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
If you see it, you can believe it, perceive it, retrieve it and flaunt it
How bad do you want, doggone it, there's the track, if you want it
You got to put your rhyme on it!
(Peedo)
How bad do I want it? I'm ready to die like Big
A serious man with blood in my eyes for this
Success doesn't come overnight
It's gonna be dark a while until I see light (that's right!)
What is it?
(KRS)
This is no game, why should I do it?
KRS-One, me and Peedo runnin' through it
I saw you down the street in FedEx
You said you had the beats was comin', like ""I Got Next""
So we went upstairs, my man Choco hooked it up
This is KRS-Oneóturn my voice up! Whaó (wha-, wha-)
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you see it?
How bad do you hear it?
How bad do you BELIEVE you can be it?
If you doubt, then you're out
If you believe, you can achieve
I got the city on lock, but I'm gonna hand you the Keys like Alicia
You know my style, you know I'm the teacha
Philosopha, minister, emcee, Hiphop's spiritual leader
With the heater
You comin' with me? You runnin' with me?
In the spirit Scott LaRock, JMJ and Pun is with me
Yo, cats be steppin' to me ALL the time
With the rawest rhyme
But two weeks later, they fall to crime
If you listenin' to this song, and you want to be put on
You must be loyal to the cats that made you strong
It could be your friend, your father, you sister, your mother, your brother
Or some other
Just remember the days when YOU was under!
Before the Hummer, before the Benz
Before the hundreds, before the fifties, the twenties and tens
When you was thirsty, remember the living water, and who poured it
Now ask yourself, how bad do you want it?"

A North Face and skully hat don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A army suit, a pair of Timbs don't MAKE YOU A THUG
An ill mug and a gat don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A real thug is a thug that's HUSH!
(KRS-One)
Yo, yo, yo, check it, check it
Let us begin, KRS, winnin' again, KRS-One did it again
KRS bigger than them, look at them they bit it again
I think my gun just gonna start clickin again
Click-clack, I always spit back
Anybody call my name I go get that
In fact we draggin 'em out, to a deserted route
The teacher returns, you must learn, the word is out
No doubt highly respected, Front Page Records
Off the hook, yet still connected
Are you teachin yourself, teachin yourself?
I'm like history repeatin itself
""Criminal Minded"", you've been blinded again
Lookin' for my style you can't find it again
You can find these others that may sound like Kris
But when it comes to the hands they don't get down like Kris!
They never ran up in the clubs with a hundred thugs
Never had the respect of Crips and Bloods
Never knew B.O., they never knew Big Pun
They never battled MC's, they never bust they gun
They don't know that, all they know is that show DAT
That's Digital Audio Tape if you don't know that
Now go back and get my name correct
'Fore I snatch that platinum from 'round your neck
(Chorus 2X: Nyce)
A doo rag a platinum chain don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A fat ride with chrome don't MAKE YOU A THUG
That tough guy talk don't MAKE YOU A THUG

Yo, yo, yo (hit 'em Kris!)
What mean the world to me? H-I-P, H-O-P
And S-I-M, O-N-E
And G-O-D, I stay low key
I go down to hell, and slap up Satan
Then return to heaven, where Scott LaRock is waitin
Resurrection, just like my brown complexion
When I speak, I don't need protection from the heat
I walk these streets and I'm quick to hit first
Throw on any beat I'll be quick to spit first
And rip town, I take one look around
And all you hear is, ""Get down, get down, get down!""
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, I stay on blast
That's why these rappers want me to go on last
That's the truth, that's the fact, that's the deal
Forget sex appeal, my tech is real
And my rep is real, K-R-S
Woo-woop-woop! That's the sound of E-M-S
The rag on your head, it best stay white
'Cause I can turn that red in a mintue a-ight?
Now go back and get my name correct
'Fore I snatch them diamonds from 'round your neck
Once again, get my name correct
'Fore I snatch that platinum from 'round your neck

A North Face and skully hat don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A army suit, a pair of Timbs don't MAKE YOU A THUG
An ill mug and a gat don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A real thug is a thug that's HUSH!
A doo rag a platinum chain don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A fat ride with chrome don't MAKE YOU A THUG
That tough guy talk don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A real thug is a thug that's HUSH!
(KRS-One)
Yeah... yeah... yo, yo, yo
To all my heads who wanna see an improvement
In hip-hop culture, join this movement
We need more glocks than my man Freddie Foxxx
The knowledge I spit to the click it don't stop
That hardcore God-core, ready to start war
Rock more shock more top your pop tour
I'm sure I'll drop the grade to zero
When the teacher return, I don't chase DeNiro
Like where yo? Where yo? They livin' in fear yo
It's a jungle sometime, but I got my spear yo
The album's called ""Sneak Attack"", that's what it is
KRS-One spittin' facts to kids
(Chorus: Nyce)
A army suit, a pair of Timbs don't MAKE YOU A THUG
That tough guy talk don't MAKE YOU A THUG
An ill mug and a gat don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A real thug is a thug that's HUSH!
A doo rag a platinum chain don't MAKE YOU A THUG

(KRS-One)
Come in {*door opens*} sit down
Yeah...
I have a magical mind, a magical body
Ancient metaphysician, you better AX somebody
With one handshake, I can tell if your plan's fake
I am to hip-hop, what flour is to pancakes
I write rhymes till my hand aches
In the mountains of Colorado, takin' in the landscape
When I'm in the city I can't wait to live again
In the underground hot springs of the Hopi Indians
So you look around your heart and your mind
You will find, I am there
If you're cold and you're broke and there's fog in your scope
Have hope, I am there
Get in tune with me, move with me, boom with me, room with me
Zoom with me, I am there
I can see where you're at, feelin' trapped, can't move can't act
I was there
And it's quite clear
My hardware was set ahead of most folks by ten years
The hand of God set it, so on Earth I speak prophetic
Publishin papers with no edit
I speak but most don't get it, but the few that do get it
In their minds my words stay embedded
And they blessed if they don't forget it
They'll never need a psychiatrist, a psychic or a medic
Where we headed? To the ultimate state of freedom
That's where I'll lead 'em, if you let it I'll free 'em
Let's set it, for human beings in recreation
Havin' fun recreatin themselves into a nation
Hip-Hop! It's home could never be a station
Sharin a space with R&B, stop fakin
Do you know how much money they makin' offa you and I
Just because hip-hop won't unify?
So look inside your heart or your mind you will find
Everytime, I am there
If you're cold and you're broke and there's fog in your scope
Have hope! I am there
Get in tune with me, move with me, boom with me, room with me
Zoom with me, I am there
I can see where you're at, feelin' trapped, can't move can't act
I was there"

On your own sleepin' in the park yeah I been there
How we really gonna survive? Let us begin there

I'm talkin' to the little you but, there is a bigger you
The bigger you is spiritual, little you that is physical
KRS is givin' you, somethin' more than I get with you
I'm hittin you, splittin you, rippin you down with me
You busted that metaphysical rap, at the pinnacle I'm at
I'm down here just to deal witchu cats
I never bleep you, I just remind you that they don't need you
They gonna keep you for as long as they can eat you
But that mic you speak through goes from here to Mogadishu
And how you represent US is the issue
I'm not here to diss you, or dismiss you
But at any moment we can be hit with missiles
(KRS-One)
How many MC's must get dissed
How many young men must get frisked
How much ice can really go on one wrist
How many shots get fired at a target and just miss
We gonna live like this?
I walk the same path that Ma$e do
But he went in the church, I stayed out to face you
The difference between us is not just man to man
But in fact it's fan to fan
People that buy KRS-One goin' places
People that buy your shit, they catchin cases
My people eat, your people cheat
Such is the words you speak and you reap
You can pop that shit if you like
But people that buy KRS-One, they lookin' for the light
Like NYCE, Jada, Lizzard, B.C.
Harold, Symone, Server yo man see me"

Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two
On one, you will be asleep.

I'm a blunt gettin' smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin' smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin' smoked and I can't wake up
I'm dreaming about being a blunt
I'm running around and I just can't wake up, Hah!
I'm dreaming about being a blunt. Ho!
I'm walking around and I just can't wake up.
I'm tryin' to wake up, I can't wake up
So I run and jump
Someone yelled get that blunt.
Get that blunt, now I'm thinking this is major
I've got a bunch of people chasing me with a razor
I don't like this dream as a blunt
But I can't get out of it
And I can't seem to wake up
So I'm running and racing
Blunt smokers are chasing
This is insane, I'm caught by House Of Pain
I'm picked up
They said they gonna put my head out
They slit my back and all the tobacco fell out
Now I'm hollowed wet thin and yes ready
They poured the shumpang gently and rewet me
Check it out now, in the same attire
Here comes the fire
Now they lit it, now I'm burning by the minute
But check it out
More heads came to chill
Everlast took a pull and passed me to Cypress Hill
Cypress Hill took a pull
Lungs are full, who's next?
I'm being passed to Das Efx
As they took a mad pull, smoke blows in heaps
It's really smokey but I can still see Black Sheep
Woe! Black Sheep gets me, relights me
Room is proper, I'm passed off to Shabba
Shabba's voice gets low like a tuba
He said, ""Me no folllow no rumor""
And passed me to Grand Puba
I wasn't burnin right so Puba got mad at me
And said who rolled this
And passed me to Kid Capri
Kid Capri said ""I won't front
Pass it to Redman, he knows how to roll a blunt""
Redman said no need to re-roll
And passed me to De La Soul
De La Soul took a hit and kept hittin
Now they're buggin 'cause they passed me to Bill Clinton
Bill Clinton said I'll smoke but I won't inhale
I'll only hit it twice
He got slapped by Greg Nice
Now I fell on the floor, Greg Nice picked me up
I'm a blunt being smoked and I can't wake up
Get me out of this, somebody wake me up
I'm still on fire and I'm still being smoked up
Half my body is gone, now they're coming to my head
Now my head is being pinched by Ted-D-Ted
A crazy nightmare I got to go
I got to wake up and I'm passed off to Yo-Yo
Yo-Yo gets respect as a lady
She didn't smoke
She passed me off to Showbiz and A.G.
A.G. said respect due see
He got one big pull and passed me to Smooth B.
Smooth B. although he's talking to Ted-D
Took a hit and passed me to Fab 5 Freddy
Freddy said Yo! There's nothing left Pop
Looked at me in my face and passed me to Chubb Rock
Chubb Rock said ""Yo Freddy chill!
If you ever catch me smoking, just kick me in the grill""

You can't test the teacher

Yeah, uh come on
I got that rip track, flip that, underground rap
When I kick back
Most of what I'm hearin be weak
So I speak through beats and the streets as I teach
I impeach, through speech, each lyric leech I reach
Have a seat in the lecture
Nothin' can protect you
Hard is the texture
Of the mic wreckin rock in your sector
Better than ever remember I am no beginner
I like to shout out Eric Skinner

Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Yo, we livin' in a world of private jets and limousine
The fruit we eatin as we prepare tangerine to nectarine
See everybody livin' in the same routine
We need the telephone, and yes, we need the fax machine

Now, let me educate you with my conscious poetry
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me love, me love, me love, me love, me love it when it's bad
See if you wack rap you ought be steppin out the back
See emcees on the microphone forgettin that they black
See hear them kick the lyrics that are holdin' people back
But when you hear the teacher, KRS will find the track
You bound to see the light, and you don't want return back
So listen very closely to the secret scientist
I'm sending this one out to all my inner city kids
Now you supposed to be apostle what you have inside your head
Can make you more reliable, it can make you feel dead
Now listen very closely to the way I say this rhyme
It's the thing called the brain, and the thing called the mind
But I'm outta time
Chorus (scratching on the word ""can""):
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!

Never had a gun, never had a gun?
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?
On the block you just yap a whole lot
About the clothes that you got
Yo, or the gold that you got
Everybody sees all the friends in your Benz, yo, it's fat
But they ain't gettin' money like that
Word to my brother Kenny, jealous one envy
The rich are few, while the poor, many
But you got gold cuffs and cars and stuff
You eatin well, but still in the ghetto you dwell
You know it's hot, so you make it known about your glock
To any perpetrator tryin' to blow up your spot
You grab the microphone and talk a good ramble
You the hardcore outlaw, criminal, vandal
Burnin emcees like a candle, but you frontin
You ain't got nothin', with your life you gamble
One day you gamble up snake eyes
Talkin' all that junk about you don't take dives, you take lives
Nobody on the block tries, cause you claim you got powerful ties
So at the red light you arrive
And to your surprise you get heffed up with just two steak knives
You're terrified, they take your Benz, and what makes things worse
You ain't got gun the first"

Why I gotta return? Cause y'all's so damn wack wack
You never will learn. That's why the teacha's back
Now you gon' feel that real golden age rap
Unfolding the gat

Rappin' about your hammer is cocked back
That means you fuckin' with a six-shooter

Instead of reading the word of Christ, BE the word of Christ
Instead of following God's word, BE God's word
That's the consciousness of hip-hop
You are not just doing hip-hop, you ARE hip-hop
You are not just reading the word of God, you ARE the word of God

For me, what you see is what you get in these days
I'm so hungry you can throw my dinner right on the stage
You can bite down on my rage, bite down on my anticipation
With no doubt or hesitation, repeat this affirmation
(I WILL MAKE IT) Not I wanna make it
(SHOW 'EM HOW WE MAKE IT) In fact, we've made it
Every time we state and believe it we create it
The power of your very word is highly underrated
Sleepin' in the dark in the park watchin others push they cart
Say this whole thing in your heart

In a positive direction my lifestyle I'm leadin
I'm readin about ways of achievin what I'm believin
Every time I'm speakin' I'm seein myself leapin
Over buildings, over the one on the corner chillin'
Straight into knowledge of self, countin' up millions
Changin my situation, with creative visualization
Givin' libation for this ancient information

(This is just one style)
We back up in this piece like yeast to bread
Underground you gotta find me like an Easter egg
No need to beg, I hit the club hard on the red
While you check for CDs I'm sellin' books instead
I travel the country by car, by foot and leg
What's worse than being behind is being ahead
Prophetic visions of President Jeb
Five storms hit Florida on his head and nobody said
""What's the meaning of this? It's like God is dead""
In the minds of the people hanging onto a thread
You gotta go where your heart is led
I spit truth but some cats, they just got the hardest head
As you can see, I'm artist-led
I take it to the black, to the green, and to the darkest red
I write, recite and of course go off the head-top
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, man - don't forget that
KRS and I'm on the mic
(Class is in session, so you can stop guessin')
KRS and I'm on the mic
This is just one style
KRS and I'm on the mic
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
KRS and I'm on the mic
Listen
Here's the mission, plain and straight
We gotta nurture and develop what we create
Hip-hop is our activity on the planet
Today it's just an album; tomorrow they examine it
In the future, someone's crammin' fast
'Cause they want at least a B in their hip-hop class
I ain't even askin' you how
If our ancestors built nations, why you ain't buildin' one now?
Technology is not civilization
Civilization is not about the tools that you're making
You have an opportunity, at a new stop
Truly living hip-hop is a chance at a new park
You can play a new part: Develop new DVDs, new books, new art
Open new food marts with hip-hop food charts and food carts
Playing 2Pac while you shop (Do it)
What's the sense of being a recording artist
At a recording company for a year or two
If after the third or fourth year they can't even hire you?
In fact there is really nothing there for you
If your life is not a can of goo
Hip-hop is not a product; hip-hop is me and you
What I spit will see you through
I'm freein' you with knowledge of G-O-D in you
Foot soldiers, let's go - we got this
The freedom to be really you that's what hip-hop is
What can we really do? Reach for the top, kid
Those that seek the bottom they shot stop and lock, kid
We the inevitable, most credible
And most are leaning back with the terrible squad
Here to beat knock hard, this is the real truth
Everything I spit be backed up with real proof
Welcome to the underground
Don't look for me in the mainstream, this is a whole 'nother sound
Sound set we rock music in the streets
In the schools and over the Internet
Feel it yet? You ain't hear me yet
You ain't really ready to get near me yet
Y'all fear and fret"

This that official underground rap, this you can trust
I stand outside the industry and there's many of us
Talkin' mad shit but for those who not bilingual, plenty of stuff
My whole crew is why you can't get with any of us
Reason I'm not on TV 'cause I'm not sellin you nothin'
I'm not rhymin for a Bentley or a house this plush
I spit for the conscious, what about us?
Time's up, time to open that mind up

Climb up before you wind up takin'

It's all a struggle (tryin' to make it day to day)
It's all a struggle (from my hood to around your way)
It's all a struggle (single parents all by theyself)
It's all a struggle (diseases decreasin your health)
It's all a struggle (fiends swearin that's they last puff)
It's all a struggle (hustler tryin' to avoid handcuffs)
(No matter what you do, who you are or where you from)
(Rich poor black white, at the end of the day)
(Verse One: KRS-One)
It's all a struggle - and most people's struggles are doubled
You ain't the only one with a challenge facin some trouble
Look at the woman chewed up by the dog with no muzzle
Or the workers that got trapped underground in that tunnel
Some kids are playin' in pools, others in puddles
When they listen to the news the propaganda is subtle
But it's time for you to know that the cryin got to go
Release the guilt that you built and let it flow
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Move slow and on the low, this you gotta know
You don't get the muscles without the hard struggles
You ain't the only one out here tryin' to get dough
From the hustler to the preacher to the government leaders
From the airline pilot to the chef to the teachers
We linked in the same huddle, in the same tussle'n'bustle
Cause at the end of the day, it's all a struggle
(Verse Two: KRS-One)
It's all a struggle - but don't let the challenges bug you
Or the government drug you, or the thieves in the street
Beat and mug you - build your tunnel under the rubble
Come up on the other side eye to eye with the trouble
Look at the Twin Towers crumble
Look at the religious leadership stumble, everybody struggles
But not everybody comes through nifty, it's fifty/fifty
The city itself will outrun you quickly
Whether you be healthy or sickly
Whether you be wealthy or thrifty, ugly or pretty
Everybody's tryin' to get 50's and 100's
I taught this at UCLA just off Sunset
Now run get ""Ruminations""
It's a book that I published for the healing of this nation
In just a few chapters we run through, some possible solutions
Cause at the end of the day

It's all a struggle"

You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
The investigation won't go further, kill a rapper
You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
Scott LaRock's a open case, unresolved
The cops never find the killer, when it's one of ours
Tupac's a open case, even though
He was killed in a open place, there's really no haste
It's sorta like we govern ourselves
Even though we lack a love for ourselves
Or is that we know this thug shit sells?
You want them pockets to swell well
Even though we know we livin' in hell, what about big L?
Hold up, let's stop frontin', let me tell you somethin'
JMJ's dead and the cops don't know nothin'?
We gotta open our eyes to this too, this issue

You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
The investigation won't go further, kill a rapper
You wanna get away with murder? Kill a rapper
It seems like when a rapper dies, it don't matter
He simply becomes a poster, somethin' to run after
A reason for these kids to pull they guns faster
Tryin' to emulate and be like dead rappers
I roll with them visionary look-ahead rappers
From the city to the farm pushin' John Deere tractors
Bust this, in the city, there is no justice
The whole system is flawed, how could you trust this?
Crimes can't seem to be solved when it's one of us
That's why there's no forgiveness and cats just wanna bust
Hush, some people take the law into they own hand
And get burned like touchin' frying pans

Another one is Mac Dre, I don't know if y'all heard of him
But word is grim, when it turns to sin
All hip-hoppers are next of kin
We face what we supposed to face
But when it comes to them crimes
They never seem to close the case

Look
(Repeat 3X)
Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-oh-oh)
God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?
What does it mean to be in the world but not of it
It means you want the cars the cash the jewels the house but you don't love it
It means to taxes regulation state law you live above it
It means you a FREE hip-hopper, you ain't nobody's puppet
You don't see no money on me, you see it up in the cupboard
You see me up in Toys'R'Us, with my seeds 'cause they love it
You see insurance flash out, if my kids pass out
You see seven acres of land where we can all spaz out
To all my fathers that fathered, hold your head up for starters
Teach your toddlers, not to be thieves and robbers
This that other kind of rap, that leads to true hip-hop
There's other kinds of raps, but they lead you to get shot
The choice is yours, you gettin' older now
You got a kid comin', how you gonna hold it down?
It's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
What's the point if you're gettin' locked up?

You see them brothers talkin' about that crime? Forgive them
It won't be long before they words manifest and they live them
Sometimes you gotta go back to the beginnin to learn
After fifteen years I'm just BEGINNIN to burn
To all my true hip-hoppers, that pay bills and live proper
Never allow a negative thought to stop ya
Correct ya posture, stand upright not uptight
Don't be scared of the light, just prepare for the fight
We say ""Criminal Minded"", cause our thoughts are illegal
We represent the very thinkin' of, inner-city people
Real people, people that take care of theyself
They need health, love, awareness and wealth
Not to mention, knowledge of God
Not college, the job then dead - if you agree nod your head
It's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
But what's the point if you're gettin' locked up?

Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-oh-oh)
God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?
C'mon c'mon yo, tonight is it
We gonna steal away together, through these rhymes I spit
When the student is ready, the teacher, shall appear
So I'm here, but are you really ready to face your fears?
Mo' money, mo' money, is that your credo?
You've been livin' in a dream world Neo, power to the people!
Nobody's equal, everybody's diversed and different
My lyric'll never cheat you, my verse is gifted
So manifest what you believe is God almighty
It could be Allah Jesus Krishna Buddha Aphrodite
It could be Nefretire come hear me and never fear me
It's like at some point in your life you gonna have to hear me
I represent them teachers preachers comin' through your speaker
Manifestin another lesson to them true believers
Instead of pickin' up our women ready to mistreat 'em
You better get yourself a wife and kid and never leave 'em
You better teach 'em you better read 'em you better feed 'em
The system will defeat 'em if you don't teach 'em the cops'll beat 'em
The style that I be kickin quick is ""Edutainment""
Hip-Hop culture needed a teacher quick so I became it
Instead of rhymin about my history and what I been through
I'd rather rhyme about awakening the God within you
Yo, it's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
But what's the point if you're gettin' locked up?

Check it Now!Back up on the set KRS is on the mic' kid

No need to hype it but KRS-One's the one who pipe's it
These lyrical freestyles meanwhile you're gettin' excited
Quickery, inginiery, over my delivery I'm glittery
I'm rhyming against biggetry while you're giving me...
...Ignorance, incompetence, inexperience!I'm not hearing it!
I battle with expedience and obedience, you macking the ingredients
Hiphop you're not being it!You're trying it

I'll take ya dark demo and put the sky in it
You say you're dope but like an Elvis Presly CD I ain buying it

But remember: I don't write rhymes I write classics

With every breath I breathe I choose life for the children
With every breath I breathe I choose a wife and good livin'
With every single breath that I ingest I am given
A smidgen to make life-changin decisions, listen
My mission with precision will position our children
By the millions to start buildin our culture for the billions
And trillions of people comin' after us
If they doubt, they won't be as fast as us
Cause in our time we kick a new power rhyme
We keep renewin your mind, cause soon you will find
That every single breath that I breathe keeps us conscious
Enough to perceive and achieve if you believe
But oxygen comes from the trees
Without air for four minutes forget it you catchin some Z's
So which is really conscious, us or nature?
Maybe the trees wish to elevate the paper
And maybe this was just the fall
To forget that nature thinks, we doin' nothin' at all
And this is the way of the world
The world meanin' the conscious nature and the earth that swirls
Like buffalo girls we go 'round the outside
Kris is controversial but Kris never lied
In the forest, the mountains and the hills I reside
You gotta follow the purpose you feel inside
{*Cut and scratched: ""Life""*}

With every single breath I choose
With every single breath I move
With every single breath I prove
With every single breath I use
With every single breath I snooze
With every single breath I cruise
With every single breath I choose life
Not strife
Or strain, some like that I came, to rearrange the game
Others blame and remain the same
Same same, but me the plan is plain
We gotta think more humane..."

88,MC's Act Like They Don't Know,1995,KRS-One (1995),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes
'Cause I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks
If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go ""Illlll!""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, that's to leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or natty dread
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer
This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it
Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
'Cause they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine?
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tangle with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your I's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like artifacts
On the wrong side of the tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad iszm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em"

You cannot deny, without money you can't apply
For anything that catches your eye, I wonder why
The root of all evil, let me teach you, now who am I?
The MC, teachin' my people ""Don't live that lie""
You got to get money, but don't let money get you, guy
I can break it down like whatever you want
Whatever you spend your money on strong, yo that's what you flaunt
Spend your money on these honeys, yo if that's what you want
Spend your money on attorneys if you're goin' to court
If I look around your neck I can see what you bought
What, you think you get respect? No, you takin' a short
Yo, you need the money, of course, you need it to live
(Yo, what you put your money on, Kris?) Yo, right on my kids
M-o-n-e-y, don't ask why. It IS the root of all evil
Though very necessary to your livelihood
It's all good when you got enough
Till enough ain't enough and you hit upon rough times
You make your money and I'll make mine
(Yo, we need the...) (Money!)
Don't get me wrong, mistakin' this song
Like money is not important - yes, it is, just be strong
It's the reason for the thievin' and that war goin'on
It's the reason that you seein' all these girls in their thong
It's the reason that the radio's on
It's the reason that you believe if you gotta work from sun-up till dawn
It's the cravings that connect you to that money you makin'
Your desire is the fire got you feelin' you slavin'
(Free yourself!) Money doesn't make you the man

Ok, I'm a get this money, really, all day
But not to the point where I'm goin' the wrong way
I'm a put my money down on rides and all that
Hook up the house so me and my spouse can fall back
Investing my knowledge way beyond college
Write books and fly hooks in my cottage
Cheese - Kris bling-blingin'? Yo, please!
Money is an energy that gets what I need
I can understand them cats that rap flossin' and frontin'
It's all good, they from the hood, never had nothin'
They just got they money and everything's sunny
Hear what I'm saying, they preyin', boy, and lookin' for bunnies
Did we floss what we bought
Forgetting that sharing is what we've been taught?
'Cause this here gettin' money is an individual sport
Money can get me in to the same place where years ago
My bros and sisters with black skin
Were confined to the back door and the kitchen
Last verse, where your cash purse
Reach into your wallet, nothin' alloted, that hurts
Breath stinkin' you're thinkin', but can't afford Certs
Need the dollar and baby hollerin' - no work
I don't know how you gonna get the dough
You could become educated, you could become a ho
You could do both, that's like puttin' butter on toast
The bread is the knowledge, butter is what gets you that close
Money is funny - how a piece of paper can make or break your very existence
Quick as it come, quick as it go - you better know about the ebb and the flow
You get money in droves, trick it on cars and blow
Throw dollars at black queens 'cause, for the dough they'll strip their clothes
And for the right amount of money
A king will pimp his queen into being a ho on a stroll
Life will always be hard when you choose to make money your god"

This for the hood, for the ghetto

How can I get in the front if I ain't gettin' in front

Lies spread it to none, rely on heaven and funds

To a track with two live nayendas
Marley, KRS cono dude well that makes it tres
Make a tape, no crosshairs, my aim is great
This ain't the top 8 at 8, it's Hip-Hop 88
When it wasn't all about guap' in a baby face
Back then
How all them entiendo porque
Soy un free ya boy, hundred percent loco see the toys
Can't win on the streets dog you need a lawyer
Use your real eyes and realize
That real lies are upon us and stop gettin' cornered
Mira, Mira, the teacher
Mira, see the teacher, he a come tina rap eater
The teacher, a specialist speaker
To stand next to the leader you must be next to BE leader
We free and we strive to be freer
The one that helps you to become a better you, that's your teacher
Through these lyrics I reach ya
The truth speaker, roof reacher, proofreader, meaner no one

Skinny cat, young cat, with a knapsack strapped to my back
1981 before the crack attack
I used to let the Olde English 800 suds bubble
In the last car of the Franklin Avenue shuttle
Brooklyn, no doubt, Wingate Park, no doubt
Prospect Park I'm all laid out
Homeless, my gear played out and I know this
But I'm an MC I stay focused
I took the shuttle to the D and wrote my rhymes in a hour
Took the D to the E, last stop the Twin Towers
Sittin' in the belly of the beast
In the World Trade organization, bein harassed by the police
I wrote my rhymes right there on the spot
New York City, 1984 corruption was hot
Cats sellin uzis out the Jacob Javits Center for a high price
Let me tell you 'bout my life

High class hustlers, I'm takin' flicks with them
My first songs Red Alert, he's mixin them
This a far cry from a kid sleepin' on the bench
Now I'm V.I.P. in the club, this don't make sense
But it does, as I take daps and hugs
From cats that move drugs, they say ""Kris rise above""
Everybody knew my style, Kris was no coward
I wanted to get in the game but my peeps wouldn't allow it
They'd say, ""Read them books and write them hooks
Save our children, give 'em a whole new outlook""
So I did, I lived like any street kid
But I was handed 20 books, others were handed 20 year bids
Still they wouldn't sell to your mother or your wife
There was respect man~! Let me tell you 'bout my life

1987 my career blowin' up now
Me and Scott LaRock took the year growin' up now
Me I'm just a private cat, whatever you perceive as live
KRS is as live as that
We the livest act, in eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-now
But them years be far behind me now
In ninety-one, no one can find me now
I chose the underground to rhyme where it's grimy, WOW
Rewind me now, 13 albums for you to see
Or catch me speakin' at them universities
My mind stays keen, I'm hardly ever seen
I do a lot of work, just not in the mainstream

Yeah, yeah
Y'all don't really know about the KRS rap
Y'all don't really about why we stay trapped
Y'all don't really know hip-hop ain't rap
But let me tell you how we can get it all back
First realize givin' up is wack
Say to yourself I can never be wack
Then realize that we must go back
And the reason you can't seem to get on track
Is you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name
And how I get down and move around
I've already been to the proving ground
In conscious rap, who rule the sound
The question is are you down?
[Chorus] w/ minor variations
(KRS-One)
Look - KRS-One, I've learned already
Everything they doin' is temporary
No matter how big you live
You still the creation of a music executive
And when you get old no matter what you did
They throw you away and they pimp your kid
Yeah kids, on the TV whylin
You know why we got racial profilin?
Cause you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name
So there in the future we'll look back
And then we will see we were under attack
But it'll be too late, the loss'll be too great
You'll see, just wait!
[Chorus] w/ minor variations
(KRS-One)
C'mon, c'mon, yeah c'mon
You see how they shuttin down KRS-One
'Cause I'm not sexy, thuggin' or dumb
Ask yourself -
- Why they only promotin criminal activity and nothin' else?
On the videos and on the radio
Teachin our kids which way to go
And the way that they tell our kids to go
If you listen, heads right straight to prison
While you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, y'all better peep the game
You got to release that temptation
Get a brand new affirmation
Your life is what you make 'em

And another one bites the dust when
Conflicts arise and dudes start bustin'
And cussin, I gotta speak to this
New York is not unique in this
But if we keep sewing this we gonna keep reapin this
I'm teachin this, we gotta overcome our weaknesses
Remember man!

I go off like a glock 9, no safety on Kris

""Boogie Down was performin, hey they ain't no joke"" -> Slick Rick
""Down with the sound called B-D-P"" -> KRS *
Verse One:
Back in the days I knew rap would never die
I used to listen to Awesome-2 on WHBI
I used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops
Rappers wore bell-bottom Lee suits
Me and Kenny couldn't afford that
So we would go to the park when they was jammin' to hear rap
I used to listen till the cops broke it up
I always thought to myself ""Damn, why they fucked it up?""
But never the less I was in love with the microphone
And it stayed that way until I left home
On the streets of New York, now I'm free
But with freedom comes big responsibility
I used to walk around driven by the force
I remember how large Super Rhymes was when he fell off
I used to wonder about crews that used to rock
They were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top
Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Record deal and video outta here?
Mercedes Benz and Range Rover outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!
Verse Two:
After livin' on the streets alone
Some years went by, I signed myself into a group home
I used to watch the show ""I Dream of Jeannie""
And dreamt about ""When will I be large like Whodini?""
But I was messin' with graffiti on the subway
And gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday
I knew it had to bea better way see
So I would go to my room, blast RUN DMC
Around 1984 I left the group home, again alone
Still dreamin' about the microphone
Gimme a chance man, I know I can rock it
But I had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket
So when I reached the shelter I met my helper DJ Scott La Rock
And we both loved hip-hop
I was takin' suckas out in the shelter system
Yeah there was rappers in the shelter but I had to diss 'em
But all along, my vision was never lost
I kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off
Do you ever think about when you're outta here?
Fly girl and fresh gear outta here?
Five-thousand dollar love seat outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!
Verse Three:
While I'm battling these rival crews
Yes, BDP would stay in the street news
Some said all they wanna do is battle
They can't write a song, so their careers won't last long
Around this time I used to hang with Ced Gee
And DJ Scott La Rock used to buy gold with Eric B
I didn't meet Rakim till later with Scott
I remember we were jammin' at the rooftop
It used to irk me when these critics had opinions
Scott would say ""Just keep rappin', I'll keep spinnin'""
We had a fucked up contract, but we signed it
And dropped the hip-hop album Criminal Minded
We told the critics your opinions are bull
Same time Eric B and Rakim dropped Paid in Full
Hip-hop pioneers we didn't ask to be
But right then hip-hop changed drastically
People didn't wanna hear the old rap sound
We started samplin' beats by James Brown
In the middle of doin' My Philosophy
Scott was killed and that shit got to me
But knowin' the laws of life and death
I knew his breath, was one with my breath
I had nothin' left and it was scary
So I dropped By All Means Necessary
Another hip-hop group that was a friend of me
Was a revolution crew called Public Enemy
It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back
These two albums set off consciousness in rap
But all along, I'm still lookin' around
And all I can see are these rap groups fallin' down
Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Condominium and beach house outta here?
Credit cards and bank accounts outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, be we ain't goin' out!"

(Verse One)
You ain't Fo'Reel and you ain't Universal
Your whole style sounds like a infomercial
You ignoramus, I'm the baddest with the mic apparatus
Challengin the God of rap is madness, I'll snatch your status
With these elders lookin' at Billboard you could stop them
But I got enough albums to make my OWN top ten!
You limited, like the spread of traffic
You bite my style off the radio
So when you speak in fact I hear the static
You better Chillout like Chuck, I kick like three Norrises
One of my sixteen bar rhymes is eight of your choruses
Of course it is, ridiculous
Watch out, I be in the club inconspicuous
Gotcha, on your, hands and knees
Ain't it about time for some real MC's?
[Chorus] + (live response)
The real hip hop is (ova here!)
The real hip hop is (ova here!)
Real hip hop is (ova here!)
Real hip hop is (ova here!)

Yo yo, Beatminerz, turn up the track a little bit
Gonna do this right now

Remix it, don't re-fix it
First brigade, second brigade - all swords lifted
Formation, classified information
Code red rhyme style accurate articulation
Don't test my foreign relation
The cats in Brixton, Birmingham and London just waitin
Got my cats in France like ill
Even Africa's laughin' at'cha right along with Brazil
The West Indies? Jus' wan fi kill
Got Canada mad at'cha, Germany heard of me, they seen the skill
Hip-Hop is more than a thrill to us
A dollar bill to us, believe you will trust in that
'Cause if you bust at me, on TV, CD
Internet trust that, I WILL BUST BACK
I turn down heat real quick, when I spit
You need the medicine what I speak is so sick
Then again these veteran be better than many men
Forever we hit 'em again better than ANY trend they could ever say
In any season, hot warm cold or freezin
When it comes to MCin, we believe in rhymin for a different reason
No frontin, my rhyme style tells you somethin'
They rhyme style tells you who they freakin
But you was already told - what does it profit a man
To gain the whole world and lose his soul?"

Yo turn me up just a bit, so I can hear it and spit
Reverse spit, and get tips, rehearse a hit and take tricks
Research the art just a bit, don't let me start I won't quit
But if I start I'ma flip, just like I'm startin the whip
Puttin' the key into it, mentally seein it
G.O.D. believin in it, I get a fee when I spit
C-L-U-B's I just rip, I'm lyrically well equipped
Over the beats and the mix, I keep the streets in a fit
When it comes to lyrical spit, I'm the t'cha of it
Higher consciousness, truth, I'll be reachin' for it
Metaphysics, here's an example 'cause I'm speakin' of it
Put your hands in the air, but you must be aware
That even if your hands are down, ain't they still in the air?
I be takin' you all the way down the road, takin' you there
I'm livin' and givin' just a smidgen of what I share
The style that I'm kickin, lyric lickings from over there
We rockin' forever, we get better with every year
With letters and intercessors I sever every fear
Lookin' here, like UPS KRS takes it there
Let's make it clear, thought waves go through the air
You can act like you busy or you dizzy or you don't care
But listen here, everybody got a fear
An insecurity, some type of thing they gotta clear
So that's when I, reappear, from the rear
Philsopher, follow the bright light to right here
I might wear, light gear
Appear when you least expect it, tellin' you now how to fight fear
With faith, you hear the bass, well clear the waste
You gotta get the negative cats out your face
Get that irrelevant crap out your space
Conceive it believe it decree it achieve it with HASTE!
Nuttin in the world is impossible
Listen to the shit that I drop on you
KRS-One, philosophical
Believe and achieve what you got to do
(Verse Two: KRS-One)
We rawwwwwwwwwk, we don't stop
Hip-Hooooooooop, we don't stop
Tick-tooooooock, we don't stop
We at the top we never drop cause true hip-hop is so hot
Some people thuggin', some be pimpin', I be teachin a lot
I be teachin about the meaning of a deeper hip-hop
That don't make me any better than a thief or a cop
All I know is when I flow, the people be shocked
You don't really want the teacher to come step on your block
With my whole glock takin' everything that you've got
I'm a different type of deeper intellectual rock
For when you really wanna compete and get up off your block
You are not just doin' hip-hop, you +ARE+ hip-hop
Like if you have a badge and a gun, you ARE the cop
Like if you practice medicine, you ARE the doc
You just forgot rappers rap about cars a lot
And the magazines worry about stars a lot
But I'm the sun and they avoid me BECAUSE I'm hot
The orthodox hip-hop is sure to rock
With or without a video, I'm leavin' 'em all in shock, Oh!

Wasn't you the type to mimic what you saw on TV?
Wasn't you the type to mimic what you heard on CD?
You never wanted to work you wanted everything easy
You heard KRS and you said, ""That's preachy!""
A wise young man says, ""Father - teach me""
A foolish young man wants to live life freaky
Oh yes, Knowledge does Reign Supremely

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... what they givin' you back now?

Back when we was all singin' ""Monie in the Middle""
You wanted to wiggle, jiggle in a tight skirt and giggle
Even when outside was brittle, you still had on little
And KRS warned that you'll get played like a fiddle
Now you havin' cravings for pickles cause you pregnant
And don't know where the dad went and you poppin' them drugs like Skittles
When the baby is born it's little and sick
But it's no riddle, you was movin too quick, huh
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... word, look at this
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... you shoulda stayed home and read a book
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... literally, symbolically
Now you're fucked!

When advice is in your life you need to take it
Cause frankly, everybody ain't gonna make it
Back in the days we, showed 'em the way
I put it there in the music but you weren't amazed
You would criticize, debate, and basically hate
But let it be known I wanted everyone to be great
But you would diss and not even try to do better
When we was at the U.N. you said ""whatever""
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... word
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! ... we movin ahead, you still in the same spot

Begin the discussion by viewin democracy
People power, a people ruled philosophy
Democracy is a system of government
Where the whole population is the sum of it
Where the government can't move without it's people
Where before the law everybody's equal
But take a look at the police and how they treat you
Take a look at these corporations that cheat you
Democrats and Republicans are all see-through
Now we votin for the lesser of two evils
Man, don't let 'em deceive you
This is an autocracy, not a democracy
But to call this a democracy without mock interest
In the laws of society, that's called hypocrisy!

Democracy only happened one time
In European history, now keep this in mind
It was practiced in Athens overseas
In 508 B.C. by 
Citizens would get together on a hillside
And decide how and if they was gonna ride
But in 322 B.C. here's what happened
 conquered Athens
And that was the end of democracy
Where the people had a say in their society
Today, we gotta get more knowledge
And learn about the function of the electoral college
It doesn't matter who you vote for today
The electoral college has the last say
But that's another day, here's what I came to say
Rise up!
Get up! What we slowin' down for?
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!
We got a whole nation to restore

In corporate sponsored elections, who's winnin'?
This the wrong direction from the beginnin'
Every candidate got scandal, they all sinnin'
Tryin' to convince you, tellin' you what they been in
But the real issues, they get avoided
While our children still gettin' exploited
Heh, they call me Blast-master Kris
Edutainment, that's what my tactic is
Some criticize Kris, some laugh at Kris
But you can't say Kris is not an activist
Social justice, I got a pasion for this
'Cause equal rights we still askin' for this
So when I do my tours it's not just rappin' for Kris
I'm givin' you more than gun packin' with this
I'm openin' doors, you should be askin' 'bout this
You listenin' to them whores and them capitalists
They game is tight, got you trapped into this
It won't be long before the ring you like have to kiss
That's why I'm a activist
I help people not to get trapped in this
The temptation? You gettin' wrapped in this
So get up, stop sittin' like a PACIFIST

With Afrika Bambaataa - he threw the first one, that I attended
We kept the tradition going through the Stop the Violence Movement
Through Human Education Against Lies, Rhythm Cultural Institute
And now the Temple of Hip-Hop
This is Hip-Hop's spiritual base
And as a spiritual base, we look to guide the youth in that discipline
Uh, no culture is a culture, unless it has principles
Unless it has morals, unless - we are unified
In some sort of principle, something we are not going to step beyond
Something that defines us
What I'd like to do, is just for a moment as we... deal with this
Think about your role in Hip-Hop
Think about what you do everyday in Hip-Hop
This is not about right now
It's about twenty years from now
It's about ten years from now
The tapes are rolling, the notes are being taken
This is the type of thinking we have to get into
If this is going to survive and last

They can't see today how they effect tomorrow
Too afraid to follow, 'cause they trust is hollow

Why you preach so much? Why you speak and such?
Why you so bent on reachin' each of us?""

Have a seat then with us and start speakin' with us
They'll be critiquin us to be sure they believe in us
We don't need a PROBLEM...
Problem in hip-hop today!
We gotta fix it
We live non-toxic, we teach that hip-hop is
The transformation of all subjects and objects
Retrain your optics, to reinterpret the topics
We gotta stop treatin hip-hop like a product
And more of a strategy; I got graphs, charts
Sacred textbooks, these cats can't battle me
But they try, and why? Cause that's a PROBLEM...

But hip-hop's history's a mystery

With twenty cents in my pocket I saw the light
If you're young gifted and black, you got no rights
Your only true right, is a right to a fight
And not a fair fight, I wake up wonderin who died last night
Everyone and everything is at war
Makin' my poetic expression hardcore
I ain't afraid to say it, and many can't get with it
At times in my life, I was a welfare recipient
I ate the free cheese, while the church said believe
And went to school everyday, like a god damn fool
Well anyway, here I am, chillin' at the party
Brothers lookin' at me like they wanna kill somebody
A cypher manifested in the center of the jam
I got to show these wack rappers really who I am
It's me against them, so I clear the phlegm
And wage the war, hardcore to the end
For someone lookin' inside, yeah from the out
It seems like disrespect is what rap is all about

But all I really got is hip-hop and a glock
The results are obvious, if I'm confined to my block
Occasionally, in the city I'm released
To meet other beasts, lookin' for the feast
We grunt and growl, on the prowl, as the air gets thinner
""Yo yo there he go, him,"" there's the dinner
White meat, carryin a bag of some sort
Life is short, white meat is quickly caught
A scuffle a muffle yet none of us hesitated
Like Mother Africa, white meat is violated
We quickly disappear, like Santa's little elves
And go into a area to fight amongst ourselves

A piece of the pie that America flaunts

Rappers be boo-tay
Goo-fy that's how they crew stay
Bitin whatever you say to boost they ego
We know the steelo, your whole character is foul
Makes me want to shoot a free throw, BLAOWW
From the git go, no, get go, my flow hits low
Wherever all the dope shit go, there's where my shit go
Bee-dee-bee-bo, skank, I think
Self with ya groups everyone else and the bank
Others like to bring the shottie to the party
I bring knowledge of self, you cure the mind, you cure the body
Some rappers like to come to the party, hopin to leave with somebody
Check, I come with skills and I leave with your motherfuckin respect
Ah yeah... so check, UH!
Verse Three:
New types of verbal hip-hop I bring
When you know you can sing BOY you know you can sing
I do not clutter up the airwaves, with stacks of useless facts
MC's trying to be macks, but acts like ignorant blacks
Freak that, I'll snap your back as it cracks
You will experience, loss or lack of balance
Stop the violence, fry from week to week like an allowance
All of you are cowards hiding behind the mask of MC
I remember, thinkin' back to eighty-three
No video, no you had to be a real live MC
Now you younguns grow up buggin, any new jock you're huggin
Weak production, let me tell you somethin'
Any MC can battle for glory
But to kick a dope rhyme to wake up your people's another story
Act like you never saw me
'Cause when it comes to lyrics, I'm in a different category"

To a high-tech mic set, you get what you get

On Technics sets, he wrecks, collects a fee next
While you rejects practice, suffix and prefix

Embrace the papers, land of money makers

Yo yo, from coast to coast I'ma overdose you and BDP you
And Kris-Kross your mind, wouldn't wanna be you

Aiyyo I figgety flow I rocket blow a nigga out the socket

Accordin, to my niggaz in the sewer
Yo you a, corny nigga so we gots ta do ya

This for my niggaz on the block, handlin rock like Kenny Anderson
I'm brandishin, stiggedy styles to keep MC's vanishing
Scattering, fuck it, styles don't be mattering
My pattern's amazing son Blazing like a Saddle and
Battling's a no-no, got more Fame than Coco
I'm paid and still drips ya with a blade from my logo
So take your, style and Go-Go like D.C. niggaz

For classes, yo KRS come get up in they asses

What... I say, follow me follow me
With my syllable syllable lyrical criminal
MC threats are minimal to my phsyical they just
Whittle and whittle away, with little and little to say
As they piddle and paddle away, they say OK
But I chop that ass up anyway
What's your handle I got mad MC heads upon a mantle
I got genuine MC skin sandals
I light the mic up like a candle, watch it melt
'Cause when I felt lyrics you both are screamin for help
When you hear it, you can't bear it, you can't even wear it
You oughts to just cheer it, go get it spirit!
As I fa-la-la-la-la, I'm comin' with that rara
Rockin' mics when you was googoo gaga to your momma
You wanted to battle KRS when you was young you told your poppa
He slapped you in your head and said UHH-UHH
But you didn't heed the warning
Now I'm in the place, now I'm your face
Lookin' at your crew but they all broke out
Because they nothin' but lace
KRS is like mace, in your motherfuckin face

It means return of the real hard beats and real rap

See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)*4
People always callin me a top celebrity
'Cause when I'm on the mic
I like to speak freely
You hear me chattin lyric but I'm not an MC
A one poetic member of the crew B.D.P.
I looked around the nation but I simply couldn't find
Another entertainer wit a rhyme like mine
I pick up the mic and I tear up the phone
At this point in the party I should be left alone
But uh-oh uh-oh I've come to show
A brand new flow
Is the flow wack? NO!

Come to the show in a b-boy stance... bogle in the dance

I buck two shots and you squad is gone
You add a little street in your R-a-p
But never do you wanna challenge B.D.P.
'Cause smashin up a crew, one-two is the least
When a sucka wants ta battle that just gets me geesed
I never backed down from to an MC feud
Never on stage KRS got booed
Stayed hardcore never changed my attitude
I got the hip hop juice for the hip hop food
I eat when I drink, an I drink when I eat
When I speak, what I speak
What I speak is not weak
Now Boogie-down, boogie down, boogie down produc
Wit the buck buck buck buck buck buck BUCK!

122,Rising to the Top,2007,Hip Hop Lives (2007),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"... To you super listeners
How you doin' tonight
All you fly guys and fly girls
Welcome once again to the world famous Mister Magic Rap Attack
And of course I am...
Way way back before the ""Hots"" and the ""Powers""
We used to listen to live mixing for hours
Rocks and Shantay, U.T.F.O.
Mister magic rap attack some of y'all know
But I was in the shelter in weakness, homeless, turntableless and microphoneless
Fresh gearless, but still I was fearless and focused on being the dopest MC alive
It's '85, LL's on Def Jam with the best jam
And Whodini's on job
Man you know I had to survive
New York City was crazy in the 80's but damn it was live
So here comes the Juice Crew with MC Shan
Shantay's already the queen
Marley's already the man
Y'all don't really understand
When you throw on Shantay or Shan it got live in the jam
So we went to Mister Magic
If anybody had to power to put you on he had it
We gave up the demo tape no love lost
But it seems Mister Magic just brushed us off
Somehow we heard we were wack
Every track, and that we shouldn't even call back
Right there my chore dropped, no doubt
But it made me see what I was all about
And I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
...Give it all you got, give it all you got
I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
...Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
...Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
...Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got
In the spot new Hip-Hop and Latin corners
And the Union Square and the rooftop
We used to hear them tunes pop in the parking lot
Where it got dark a lot
Me and Scott La Rock
But it was all for the Hip-Hoppers
Salt-N-Pepa answered Doug E Fresh with ""The Show Stoppa""
MC Shan was gonna challenge LL
Shantay was battlelin' 3 or 4 groups at the same time what the hell
Answer records were big then
After Shantay did it everybody was trying to spit them
So we spit off, to tell you the truth it was the only way an MC could get on
We answered MC Shan's ""Queensbridge""
A dope jam about where he was from and where he lived
But in the Bronx there was these kids
KRS, Scott La Rock trying to live
And I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
...Give it all you got, give it all you got
I'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
...Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
...Give it all you got, give it all you got
We'll keep rising to the top while my mind go
...Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got
This it what an MC was
We had a strong street buzz
Marley and Shan showed us some love
And love never hurt
Cause while Shan was with Marley we was with DJ Red Alert
Every Friday night, every Saturday night
On the airwaves the battle was right
Under New York nights, [?]
Jar King at night
The rocks used to get so hype
You could put on your headset and get with heads [?]
Live MC's going [check check]
Spitin' rhymes over the radio set
These are the days and the ways I can never forget
So I don't forget it
To Marley and Shan I am indebted
For the start of my career these guys could take credit
For my rappin', the whole battle they let it all happen
Marley and Shan and Shantay could have been guns trappin' cousin
But they wasn't, and you know why
'Cause we was on some real Hip-Hop
Lets keep it buzzin'"

Watch another rapper body get stiff

Don't let me have to kill you kid, god forbid still

Wow, for a amateur you really looked hard
But you're really a bitch, when you get it together
Call me, here's my card
Check the list: you lack breath control, mental behaviour
Lyrical talent, imagination and flavour
I got no time for amateur rhyme, you could be hurt
Thinkin' you're hard because you wear a gangsta T-Shirt
I'll smash your wanna-be ass in the deep dirt
Black, you'll come up dizzy sayin' ""How da fuck he do dat?""
'Cause you're yappin' like you can't be reached

It's the regular, when you checkin' the, one that perfected the
Smilin' faced people posin as your equal
Knowin' they wanna beat you defeat you and eat you, but they greet you
With peace and love, not with the piece but the dove
Not beneath but above, now the cheek give a hug
Snug, no grudge, till you turn your back and learn the facts
Called learnin truth, the tree is only KNOWN by its fruits
These smilin' faces, in many places, sometime they racist
Sometime they sexist, sometime they want your Lexus
Sometime they be your family members remember
Oh no not my lady, oh no not my fella, with them you thought
You'd never ever sever, but they was two-faced - it happens
With a whole 'nother agenda but clever to say whatever forever
Let me make this relationship better, if you real stay real
Be real, the truth we got to treasure, not these

That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!
(Yes, indeed)
Stand clear! Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out! We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack, but you be doin' that
I'd rather say ""see ya""! 'Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer? You wicked overseer!
Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
'Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
'Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!
Now here's a likkle truth, open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word ""overseer"" like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patrolling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back to put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way
(Yes, indeed)
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed 'cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up till today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!"

Raw rhymes for raw times
My albums are underground, but this blessing is all mine
And when it's tour time, we open more minds
You need to rethink who you think is the ""Greatest of All Time""
I got this -- I'm raw like Freddie Foxxx is
Hardcore like The LOX is, Scott LaRock is where Tupac is
Where hip-hop is, Digital-ly Underground like Shock is
Oh yes -- I know where the top is
But I'd rather rhyme about how crooked some of these cops is
My synopsis ain't pretty
I'd stay, off them plains and, out the city if I were you
Do what you gotta do
But while you wave them flags, remember Amadou ... Diallo
Here's what we gotta do, follow
I'll put hip-hop in you if you're hollow
Those that already filled, STILL take swallows
Goin' over potholes with Tahoes
You don't think +I+ know? Huh! I'm lookin' at you right now
You ain't dancin in the club, you in your car, sittin' down
You in the crib, on the low
You got them headsets on the go
You just saw me at the show - oh you don't know?
It's the Temple of Hip-Hop, comin', with a whole DIFFERENT flow
Yo where them hoes at? I don't know
But wherever God at, I'ma go
I give 'em a hard rap AND a flow
That's why when they call back for the show, with no video
We get up and go!

It's the, truth for ya, it's the proof for ya
My Cristal passes more bars than lawyers
The underground sound, this is not easily found
You don't need no rings to be down
This is, past the platinum and gold
We already had 'em, it's old
Here's the truth if it be told, gather 'round
Philosopher style is known to be wild
If you only holdin' them guns, who's holdin' your child?
You got to be thinkin' you KNOW that you shrinkin
When the art of Navigation has been reduced to a Lincoln
Change the dial! I was free then and I'm free now
You free, runnin' to MTV? I don't see how!
You know the real from the fake, you know they stealin they cake
You know it ain't about the art, it's all about what they make
You know the radio's late, you know they play what you hate
That's why you got that Kay Slay tape, tryin' to escape
You know the love of the cars and the rims
Tattooed arms and Timbs, are also called sins
You know you got to pay for these spins
You know the rap magazines be wack from beginning to the end

You my sister I'll be tryin' to get you OUT of the bed
I'm a philosopher sayin' what has GOT to be said
I don't FILL you with lead, I bring that KNOWLEDGE instead
FOLLOW this dread, I'll take you from A to Zed
Who am I? Just a scholar called K-R-S
You can spend your money on others but THEY AIN'T BLESSED
You can spend your money drugs and STILL BE STRESSED
Look around for conscious rappes yo there AIN'T NONE LEFT
I'm holdin' it down; better yet I'm holdin' up
Waitin for some young buck to come and sip from the cup
And continue with the menu puttin' new knowledge in you

Potential lawyers engineers and doctors, I do attract 'em
Go to your professors and ask 'em
If the songs of the ""Edutainment"" in college they didn't blast 'em
Yes - I'm that ancient one
I set the framework for today's rappers to make they funds
But no you don't know me son
My facial features matches the Sphinx with it's nose redone
You know how many clubs we done rocked?
You know how many guns we done popped?
You know how many funds we done dropped?
You know how many ones we done got?
We been gettin' live since the days of Chubb Rock
We know how to survive; these other cats
Be in at nine o'clock then be out at five, uh

Makin' these whack rappers tow the line

It was either me, Kane, Rakim or Slick Rick!

Welcome to the ""KRStyle""
This year I had to switch styles and bust off two miss-iles
And that's not all, rappers have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall - but still in all
I have X amount of lyrics to get 'em all
Live at the club I spit 'em all
Rappers backstage lookin' sad and piti-fal
'Cause they know I'm the pinna-cle and they mini-mal
I spit the metaphysical, the spiritual
The oracle, the lyrical, the oratorical
Rookie! I'll mop the floor witcho'
I'm the lyrical foundation to all your flows
All your clothes, all your shows and I'm not alone
You wouldn't even know how to hold the mic or the phone
You couldn't even bite on the bone
While we was rockin' mics out in Rome
Now you hyped cause you grown?
You know we internationally known, the people love it
But what they learnin bout is on the whole, look above it
But let us get back to what we call hip-hop

Give me relief! I sing!

Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us!
Check it
All beef can be squashed if you want it
But instead of forgiveness, ego you flaunt it
Everybody gets into two or three quarrels
Leadin to a squabble, someone will die tomorrow
Life is not a thing you can borrow
All beefs don't have to lead to sorrow
Will ya, go out tomorrow
I think, you should think about the beef you got
And confront your enemy before it gets too hot

TIGHT AN GOOD, come is it TIGHT AN GOOD
Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, old King go Blast dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ASCAP lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin', youth trackin, talent lackin
MC's more worried about their financial backin
Steady packin a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin they cousin, they buggin
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin, even though some people front
It's the God of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin' airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, MC's are just hopeless
Thinkin' record sales make them the dopest

The same thing that happened to organs and flutes, and real artists
Thank God for The Roots, the soldier that's home with his family
Support for the troops yeah, now let's start this

So electric my energy is remembered I'm limitless
My mind screamin just against the rhythm, intense is the ism
In 'em I long salute the young and hungry to shine
Nightmares of lost time haunt taunt me to rhyme
Been isolated, waitin years to finally reappear
Cheers I made it, all praise due, Inebriated
These words are weaponry, huh, mental telepathy
Rocks for definite, reppin it, till the death of me
Pain left in me runs deep, and leaks through the speakers
In Jeeps and tape decks, then connects to your peeps
We keep it, thorough borough to borough, city to ghetto
Rock like, heavy mental on the, instrumental
So who's up? (Illin') You live hip-hop?
Get on the mic and give it what you got
I got five on it, you want it, flaunt it without hazzy
Dues paid check the rezzy, the black film be
That of a blunt's ash, past he of the spectacular cash
To get after master {?} atlas
I rep even when I be fingerin them, get it, probably not
Probably thought I meant that snitch talk
Starvin your brain, I never come with the simple and plain
To get at these thoughts, get on the train-er
I'ma af'ta learn ya bwoy, ya not fi come wit de sum'n
Microphone check one, no frontin
You niggaz is mimin your rhymes cause y'all ain't sayin' nuttin
Some of dem soft, me foot bak I'm 'pon de mic
{?} +Good Will+ stay +'untin+
Fear new day mon, un if ye wake up
Industry feel de shake up
Married to the ghetto you niggaz forget, break up
Ah so who live hip-hop
Upon de hip, me ride the Soul Train ock
Yo I'm not to be confused with these popular new names
I been paid my dues I'm at the top of the food chain
And I should get an award for slept on peeps
So this beat'll be perfect for my acceptance speech
Forever loved in your city, thanks to rap
My album's a continuous seller like fitted Yankee caps
I'm like a demon, crossbred with a ragin bull
I'm from the South but I relate more to ""Paid in Full""
So focused on my grind, I'm potent when I rhyme
Tell niggaz close your fuckin' mouth and open up your mind
It takes more than a few weeks to learn
I make sure rappers and microphones ain't on speakin' terms
As far as you concerned, I'm losin my temper and patience
Nobody takes shit serious like an impotent rapist
So who's up? (An Ion) You live hip-hop? (True dat, true dat)
Yo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got
I'm aggressive, progressive, words young ticker be vital
Rip the game and the name to reclaim any taken title
Directly hand out stares to the needle as it rotates
An agent to decrepit from rigormortis in flow eighths
Not even for a minute can you rap
Let down by the sound that drowns the clowns even dare to step
Don't ride the rhythm, I order you to jock
Your claim to fame was holdin' down but you can't hold cock
Damn right we can fight, I stay with grudge
With no prior budge from the previous
And when is it that fourth'll crack cranium, kids come in the picture
Knowin' that asshole and Ion and you ain't the perfect mixture
Like Alice, diners become the impeccable haven
That any enter my zone must be stripped down and shaven
I stand before you as a fiendish critter
Creatin' causin collision with a pen
Written that hatred of spaced-out squashed men like it was a sin
The only job payin' me enough to snuff the rough
Should have never planned the plan to make you perish
Leavin' your fan and your uncle and son with somethin' he can cherish"

Bo! Boom bye bye, hip-hop will never die
Despite the fact that I'm fly I'm never dry
You could beat me, cheat me, when you meet me try to defeat me
But nevertheless you'll have stress, 'cause I don't rest
You wanna know what my problem is, if you're curious??
I take this hip-hop shit too serious!
I forget that other rappers ain't true to this
So when they grab the mic I get hyped like LET'S DO THIS!
All my rhymes are fat, while rappers are skimpy, wimpy
So I simply chew they crew like a Blimpie
Skip me when you dissin, skip me when you on a ego mission...
I blow up, like nitroglycerin!
You better tune in to Teddy Ted"

Tonight's a special night
So remember with pride, these 20 happy years
I can't leave my b-boys alone
I can't leave my b-girls alone
Let's turn this house right into a home
C'mon y'all let's get into the zone
Vibrate or mute or cellular phone
In here they might already be on roam
Minds are blown, I'm showin
You ain't gotta go major you can do it alone
As I look back on all the years, all the tears
All my peers, in fear
I hear, insecurity, the need for clout
Low self-esteem and self doubt
KRS lays out a whole different route
And shows you what hip-hop is really all about
Then we on the route, release self doubt
And sing with the feds when the fear is out now
Clear 'em out now, from the bottom to the tip-top
Take the vow, I am hip-hop
And recreate yourself, love don't hate yourself
Do not deny or lie or fake yourself
You can make yourself, reawake yourself
You can mold remodel and reshape yourself
You gotta take yourself more seriously
Create yourself to what you really can be~!
Yo the villain is free, look at me, I do what I do
I am hip-hop and so are you
Yo we almost through, but before we go
I wanna invite y'all all, to every show
Where the b-boys and girls are kept on their toes
Like the Rocksteady Crew tribute with Fat Joe
So now you know, if you got what it takes
No doubt, show 'em what you really all about!
Yo, now that that is out of the way
Let me continue what I came to say
Breakers, writers, emcees and DJ's
Beatboxers too we've come a long way
Come to the Temple of Hip-Hop today
Our hip-hop week is every third week of May
Hip-Hop appreciation we remember
Hip-Hop history, that's in November
Peace, love, unity, that's the agenda
When I'm on the mic that's just what I send ya
We at the end sir, so what's the answer
Hip-Hop can be more than MC's and dancers
It's time to expand your
Awareness, consciousness, enhance your
Living, tell me, what are you playing for
What are you staying for, what are you giving?
I will demand your respect, with two MC's
Two b-boys, two DJ's on set
Two hour shows you bet!
We get authentically hip-hop as hip-hop can get
Independent, free from debt
2005 you ain't seen nuttin yet
Some like it dry, some like it wet
Some like to give, some like to get
Some like a good soundset
You a b-boy and you ain't been out to the Bronx yet?
No, yes, maybe, someday
Whatever, we bring it to you Sunday to Sunday
Workin for peace love unity and fun day
Just a little somethin' to balance off gunplay
So now for the break if you got what it takes
No doubt, show 'em what you all about!"

It make me wanna grab a gun and change my lifestyle
But it only goes so far, so live it up
Or realize what you know star, and give it up

So I keep on chasin paper till it's time to go
But should I really go for mine and put the clip all in the 9
Or stay at the 9 to 5 a day I just don't know
But a brother got a daughter I gotta support her
Caught up in the system inside a order, man I can't afford
A kitted Escalade, or bling bling
And so I gotta keep survivin, is the song that I keep singin'
I try to keep my head off the floor, the country's goin' to war
While Bush is givin' dough to NASA and ain't feedin the poor
But I keep love over these beats, these beats keep me alive
Alive, I got to stay the Priest, I will survive y'all

Yeah, once again, word up urban inspirational
KRS-One, Professor Ecks, whattup Dan? Woo
Temple of Hip-Hop, let's do it
By the sound of the track, you know who is back
It's the teacher, philosopher of conscious rap
Rappers tired of me sayin' where hip-hop is at
'Cause they know they unoriginal, copycats
Watch me bump this gospel rap, never wack
In fact, I tell you where the tracks is at
TV is wack, they wanna show us beatin' Iraq
When the question is, is where is Chandra Levy at?
(Professor Ecks)
Murdered God and left for dead like hip-hop
And admit to Condit like conduct, to kill Ecks the dread
And Kris crucified the false prophet
John F. Kennedy to these MC's, I draw and cock it
Cock on cocky cops for the love of the art
Punish the part, partition
Pardon the pause, poison pens penetrate the mental
I walk with Kris so my body's a temple
Body instrumentals and body your squad in the body of a God
(KRS-One)
Just think, just think, what if Malcolm X returned
Or Dr. King returned, tell me what have we learned?
As we takin' our turn, tell me what have we earned
Or is the ice and the cars our only concern
Mo' money, mo' money, you be yellin' it out
And on TV can't you see you be sellin us out
So in 2010, look to 2002
Who you think they gonna respect, me or you?
(Professor Ecks)
Behold, the God, in the form of the man
Walkin' off water and (?) flesh absorbs in the sand
Moor gets the land, divorcin the clan, I'm off into sand
Off and I'm slayin delicate arms from porcelain hands
Slaughtered the lambs, charge it to the game
Cats take hip-hop's name in vain
Disrespectin the forefathers who came (uh-huh)
Goddess hurt 'em right now, like when Marvin was slain
(KRS-One)
They don't want it, nope, they don't need it, nope
Just stay weeded and hope, I don't read what you wrote
Best believe they ain't dope, they deceivin these folks
With they meaningless quotes, I got my feet on they throat
What they speak is a joke, they really weak and they broke
Have a seat and take notes, on the streets I'm the Pope
MTV is they hope, they repeat what they wrote
I'm an MC that won't, let them tempt me with coke
(Professor Ecks)
Nope, flesh of my flesh, blessed by KRS
Used to love her, they (?) haven't made a date with death
Follow no man, enslave the Ecks, Professin the student
I vibe with the teacher obliged to drop (?) liver than heaters
Lyrics liable to eat us like the survivors of Jesus
Now the, blind is the leaders, your styles is egregious
Gets now the brow beateth to underground emceeth
The game is overheated, overweeded, and misunderstood
(KRS-One)
Word, just a ride in they boat, with a platinum rope
No doubt, they sellin us out, what's happenin' loc?
Quit this rappin' I won't, cause MC'n is dope
If I can't do it for the love then do it I won't
How many times we note when these rappers is dope
Satisfied, that's why I'm renewin your hope
Broaden your scope, when cleaned out your mind
My rhyme is like a new bar of deoderant soap
(Professor Ecks)
In this land of men mice and mimes, I holds right for the laws
Live life like Christ, makin' bread from mics and applause
The snakes fight with Tyson like jaws for what's rightfully yours
I might (?) 'em all, tell me - is it life or it's war?

All my sisters out there, here's the truth
You, a you've got to... {TAKE... YOUR... TIME}
Look, look!
You don't want no unsteady relationships, you want it tight
You don't want no man beggin and always gonna get, am I right?
You don't want no man sleepin' cheatin' freakin behind his wife
There's no such thing as make love, it's really make life
I don't care what nobody say; you sleep with a man, that's your husband
So make sure, before you lay down, you love him
And learn him, yes it's still sacred to be a virgin
Relax, it's curiosity that always burns 'em in fact
Sex is like candy, be disciplined, no splurgin
You don't want your stomach hurtin'
Girl, you gotta... {TAKE... YOUR... TIME}
Listen!
Cash is an issue with that he can never diss you
Even if he makes you cry, you bought your own tissue
Witcha own case, witcha own hand, wipe ya own face
And throw him out, no doubt, out of your own place
If your heart is broken you can mend it
If you're independent, your womanhood, that's when you defend it
Just... uh, just {TAKE... YOUR... TIME} woo!
Look!
{Take... your... time}
Don't come witcha hand always out
If he buys you somethin' thank him, but that's not what a man is about
Real men are real friends, showin their real commitment
He tells you he really loves you, a boy can't really admit it
If a man really wants you, that man really flaunts you
In public or private a real man really supports you
'Member what Guru taught you? Of course you ""Royalty""
You dress how you like when a QUEEN is what you ought to be
And ought to act like, and also ought to manifest
How you dress makes you constantly blessed, or constantly stressed
{TAKE... YOUR... TIME} Yo!
{Take... your... time}
Yo, yo
So while you burnin off those calories, think about reality
Get a skill for the salary, a man for the family
Not a boy, that's a catastrophe, don't get mad at me
Instead of always clubbin visit museums and art galleries
Pick the single man, admirin the ancient sculpture
He's cultured, chances are he won't insult ya
Give him your number only after you know what he does
Ask him what it is, not what it was
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the, you want the, you want the

There is no death, just constant growin'
We can't stay here forever
We all gotta go to a place we believe is better

Do I live for today or do I live for the past?
Think fast, but do not hurry
Life is a class and we should not worry
But tell me, how long you gonna ignore
Tell me how long you gonna ignore God's law?
How long can you really endure
Livin' like pimps, livin' like whores
The choice is yours, or really ours

J to the E to the S to the you to the S
You can remove the stress
Yes, we do need you here
Yes, we wanna be free from fear
Yes, we wanna start seein clear
Havin' you here, not over there
Lookin' around sayin' where, does anybody care?
Yeah, I'll be there
At the door, not at the war
At Matthew 5:44
""But I say, unto you
Love your enemies, bless them that curse you
Do good to them that hate you
And pray for them which despitefully use you
And persecute you""
This goes for them terrorists too

For everlasting life, you must listen to this
Now you could get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll go with this, yo Christians where you at?
Oh yes it's KRS, with Church of the Harvest
With Clarence {?}, hip-hop's winning evangelist
And then there's Hezekiah, his fire brings the fire
He's takin' it higher, tell 'em {THE DEVIL IS A LIAR}
I know, you thinkin' bout that Y2K
And I see, this fear that makes you lose your way
But we got, somethin' that is bigger than Benz
And we stand, upon the rock that cannot break
Through millineiums, don't you think we been here before?
Through millineiums, God has always opened the door
Word!
(Chorus: KRS-One)
You must tell the devil {*HUH*}, you must tell the devil {*HA!*}
You got to tell the devil {*Ah HA! HA!*}
You must tell the devil {*HUH*}, you must tell the devil {*HA!*}
Word, word up {*Ah HA! HA!*}
Word {*HUH*} {*HA!*}

(.. Be strong ..) Be strong (.. be stronnnnnnnng ..)
Be strong! Word
(.. Be strong ..) Be strong (.. be stronnnnnnnng ..)
Endure! Endure!
(Verse Two: KRS-One)
Yo, if all you got is money and the little things you wear
You worry bout your car note, you worry bout your hair
Then you ain't got no faith, and you must live in fear
Now listen to me people, and listen to me clear
So like I was just sayin', I think it's time for prayin'
Don't put your trust in Satan, it's Christ you put your faith in
You minimize your hatin', and stop your hesitatin
It's faith that keeps you movin, so do not be mistaken
(Chorus: KRS-One)
You must tell the devil {*HUH*}, you must tell the devil {*HA!*}
You must to tell the devil, word {*Ah HA! HA!*} word
You got to tell the devil {*HUH*} UHH tell the devil {*HA!*}
You got to tell the devil, word {*Ah HA! HA!*} word
You must tell the devil {*HUH*}, you must tell the devil {*HA!*}
Word, tell that devil, word {*Ah HA! HA!*} wo-word
You must tell the devil {*HUH*} uh {*HA!*} uh-huh, yo
{*Ah HA! HA!*} Yo
(Verse Three: KRS-One)
Now you listen to these lyrics, they speak into your spirit
You shiver when you hear it, but some just cannot bear it
But when you get up near it, there's no need that you fear it
It's KRS O-N-E you know me hip-hop be spirit
So you tell the devil HUH, tell that devil HA
Tell that devil HUH, tell that devil HA
You must tell the devil HUH, tell that devil HA!
Get out of my life, change your life, word

145,Temple Tactics,2001,The Sneak Attack (2001),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"All rise!
From around the way to around the world
The ever-sinner of Matthew Netta, gets it together
Every time I manifest the vocals we think
My voice is registered with your local presinct
I lead through knowledge, you don't see me till college
KRS-One is like that oatmeal porridge
When you get older and you realise you need it
That's when you retrieve it, now class be seated
This Boogie Down lingo is produced by Domingo
Wild styles I bring you, now go re-write your single
My last name should be Kringle for the gift
On the drummachine I program songs like Steve Smith
Don't Rif, Kin, you're not loud
You're not listening, I self-create my position
Any room I enter I transform to a church
Before you see through battle you should do some research
For we break
Samples:
-Has more rhymes than a train has tracks-
-Able to leave sucker MC's in a single rhyme-
Break-over, take-over, total make-over
When I rap it slabs a flack on your Range Rover
You's a joke clown plus you broke down
Like a coat of a cardigan KRS-One be flowing at your party
Your whole crew jetting they be seriously threating
My lyric weapon be upsetting the jamsession
Gather round now for a very important lesson
KRS-One is not the one you should be testing
No guessing, we follow strict mathematics
Temple tactics and word magic
So step up if you wanna get hurt
All year around our shows be worth
The force I observe lifts up your skirt
Leave your space cabin Captain Kirk covered in dirt
Samples:
-Has more rhymes than a train has tracks-
-Able to leave sucker MC's in a single rhyme- 2x
You got the long lasting, floors matching without asking
Rhymes with a passion, KRS-One, broadcasting
Never crashing 'cause I'm never speeding
You should be heading, what do you trick and I be reading
Leading the new school, with new rules for new fools
Flash styles and young MC's it makes they crews drool
Some say you cruel when I bust off like a new tool
Making a man you do as I drop two jewels
Positive and negative, mutualist disadditive, but I'm not giving it
The Godess is my relative, knowledge I be living it
I creep with it, come to elect ya and you'll witness it
Lyrics I'll be flicking it
Don't step this way if you begin in it
Push your hands up if you've been in it
Let me now get into it, straight rhymes hit the innercit'
When it splatter they say ""Damn, those rappers""
Switching ya, fixing a glitch in ya
Pulling the bitch in ya out, taking a bum a ridiculour route

-Has more rhymes than a train has tracks-
-Able to leave sucker MC's in a single rhyme- 4x"
146,The Conscious Rapper,2002,Spiritual Minded (2002),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"You think this is easy right? (Yeah!)
You think this is easy right? (That's easy!)
You think you got what it takes? (Yeah that's easy!)
Huh, we gon' see... we gon' see right now (Now what?)
Look
(KRS-One)
So you wanna be a conscious rapper
Can you handle the press and they negative chatter
Can you eat cold platters, and still spit data
Watchin others spit lies and they pockets get fatter
Can you climb up the ladder, and reach the top?
But it still doesn't matter, cause you ain't pop
Can you rock for the love of the art
Can you drop hit after hit after hit and still don't chart?
Can you REALLY stay loyal to God
When your life is full of strife, plus it always seems so hard
Can you handle the criticism
People holdin' you up to higher standards, but they don't live 'em?
Can you hear these kiddy flows and laugh at it
But when you spit they callin you arrogant?
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', let's do it!
(Chorus: *sung*)
Think you can do what I do
Think you can step in my shoes
You have no clue what I go through
You never felt my pain
When they attack my name
All because I have spoken the truth
(KRS-One)
To be a conscious rapper ain't a mystery
You gotta laugh when they call you contradictory
The whole industry, you gotta push and pull it
To really get with me, you gotta dodge they bullets
Blaow, blaow, blaow, every day and every way
You critics got somethin' to say
At the same time, you gotta uphold Christ
Uphold life, while others flash cars and ice
It could break you down, take you down, make you frown
It could actually shake your ground
But if you love who you are, and believe in that
Best believe you will BE where the teacher's at
And where's that? In fact, in cold or heat
Yes, I declare victory over the streets
Overstand, over these beats, over the so-called elite
Over the strong, over the weak
I know how to speak, and most of all I know how to eat
I know I want humble and meek
So you better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', uh
(KRS-One)
Look!
So you thinkin' about bein a conscious MC
Well you gotta love God and you got to live free
You got to see the life that others can't see
You got to be the person that others can't be
You can't be a S-L-A, V-E
If you sayin' to yourself, ""This may be me""
Then you know goin' in that you work against sin
Your very skills will kill the demons within
So don't expect respect from slaves and hoes
Nor the slavemaster's video shows
Nor the rap mags, you know how it go
Especially black mags, you know they don't know
Just go to the crowd that you know will need you
Cause NOTHING compares to the respect of the people
That's what you look for, that's what you work with
Cause anything else, is truly worthless
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris'
You better think about that, 'fore you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris', uh

We carry books around, manuals are bound in leather
We rock the center, the only point that's in the circle
We free MC's, what we decree will not desert you
We know what we doin', we wise and we chillin'
We calculate against the continued cries of our children
They may be cryin now but they won't be cryin later
We love hip-hop, because WE are it's creators
So we, build the Temple, write the books, teach the classes
Create instrumentals, write hooks and rock masses
NONE passes, without studyin this flow
It's all good as long as you know Kris know!

While I deal with I, Jah talk to I
When I dem go alike, only de one comply
Whatchu see with de I, look twice toward de I
If you don't unify your children them a gon' cry

The neglected the one you, never suspected
It seems you forget hip-hop plays the back
Sayin' that's my sound, and that's my sound
And that's my track, and that's my rap
And that's some chorus they did way back, look honey bringin' it back
I'm actually, I'm everywhere at every time
Animating every rhyme and every dare in every mind
KRS is my representative on Earth
Challenge him not, he's been hip-hop since birth
His main objective, is to put hip-hop in perspective
Show pity, and DESTROY these wack cities

Witness Kris rippin this
Don't trip on this, skip ahead if you're ready
My show medley is deadly
I'm about a hundred million mic years away
These players I don't hate, but I'm not here to play
I hit it all day, all night, all afternoon
Rock all mics from the days of sassoon
Where the hell was you? On the corner with rats
When we was at the LQ, lockin it down and that was that
Divine speaker, mind keeper, time teacher, time leader
I'll be sittin' in the club by the speaker
Waitin for you rappers to choke up then I eat ya
Like some prehistoric winged creature, Ah!
On your neck, like the American eagle facin East and West

Hearin the voice of an ancient spirit MC

With twenty-one shots to put the leak in us
So they can bloody the street with us
What does it mean to us
You know what they need from us
Give cream to us, hide the lies and deceit from us
That doesn't equal us
Who's ready to get in the Jeep with us
Form a fleet with us and take back the street with us
Meet with us, drop bombs in the street with us
Never saw it comin', attack on the sneak with us
Thus, they can't compete with us

Erase the doubt and the fear from our - MIND
Share our - MIND, speak our - MIND

Stand up brother, stand up sister
I told y'all before, love is gonna get'cha
Lovin' that money, lovin' that liquor
Lovin' that sex without respect you gets no bigger
I ain't got time to chill, only got time to build
You find that in those with skills
This a real MC, of the highest degree
With no video, my show they dyin' to see
Not whether I'm buyin 'em three
When you watch television just keep sayin' they lyin' to me
'Cause they are - how long you gonna stay at the bar?
I'm not desperate for money, maybe you are, but listen

First thing we gon' do is make up our - MIND
Then we gon' go, and we gon' clear our - MIND
Erase the doubt and the fear from our - MIND

Don't you think it's time we thought about the future?
Whether our children they gonna be winners or losers?
Don't you think it's time to advance the rhyme we spit?
Whether you know it or not, you deep in politics
All inside of it, in fact YOU the issue
Don't let this government diss you!
They really do not want you to vote
They really do not want you to hope
They really want you sniffin they coke
You look around yo we missin' the boat
I coulda wrote about ANYTHING to get on, but this what I wrote
And what I'm writin, is guaranteed to enlighten
Like Dr. Cornel West, Michael Eric Dyson
This is how we do it today, enough of the crime talk
KRS got somethin' new to say
Rise up, and put aside childish things
This is the message we bring; listen
(Chorus Two)
(KRS-One)
Last verse, KRS, blast first
Ignorance is bad, but temptation that's worse
They hide they purse, cause of the way we spit the verse
No one ever told 'em that the style's rehearsed
And even if they did, it wouldn't be new to they mind
Cause all day rappers confess to doin' these crimes
So when the cops see you, they're not thinkin' about me
They thinkin' about takin' you out of society
Keep it right, don't lie to me
You think it's too much preachin teachin?
Huh, well fine, we'll see
When you're locked up in J.D.C., or even prison
The truth shall set you free, just listen
You want health, and really that's about prevention
You want love, real love, and not depression
You want awareness, which come from discipline and will
You want wealth, which come from skills
When you really ready to talk, let's build
You ain't gotta be a scholar to know the next 4 years gonna be ill
I believe you already know the drill, don't lie
Don't steal, seek peace and don't kill

154,The Only One,2003,Kristyles (2003),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"In case you ain't know, check it
Let me tell you right not and the whole world
You are the only one
I saw them guys you were with
I don't flash platinum watches and drop-top whips
But you can rest assure you're my perfect fit
Every dollar that we get, we be earning it
Yo, you never have to worry about me taking a trip
Or leaving you at home so I can quickly forget
Yo, with me it's the opposite, you swerve the jeep
You the queen of your house, you earn your keep
And I respect that, in high school we both got left back
We both were divorced and had setbacks
But you should never let that depress you
God has blessed you
Yo, here's what KRS do
Support your goals, keep you warm when it's cold
It ain't about now it's about when we get old
Let me tell you right now and the whole world
You are the only one
In my heart you are that number one girl
You are the one (one, one, one)
Even when your hair ain't done with no curl
You are the only one (one, one, one)
Crazy why love making we already did
Shit, that's why we got four kids
Romantic, our parenthood we planned it
On the queue two to England, cross the Atlantic
Respect, you don't have to demend
It's like you got the perfect husband and your friends can't stand it
Especially when I watch the kids
And when you come home I ain't trying to find out what you did
It flips theirs leave, 'cause they looking for the player
A little boy trying to pay theirs cell phones and pagers
But with me you living with the savior
We be up in the temple of hip-hop, or chilling with the mayor
I thank the creator
We don't need what they handing out
This is what your man is about
It's like peace and much love
Trust and respect
Your friends may have diamonds but they ain't get that yet
They may have the burghettes and cars and private jets
But all they're really good for is sex
We be hanging out late night at denys
Having conversations about every and any
Many people want what we got
A relationship that just keeps getting hot like hip-hop
You know I'm not the regular guy
You know I can't be compared
You know when the drama comes I ain't scared
My name rings bells in the street
You can say my name in any hood your protection is complete
Thugs be right on their feet
Saying What, your man is Kris?
You don't worry miss
But most of the time you're with me and the kids
Mind at ease, chilling out at Chucky Cheese's
These are my kids, I know what their need is
I know what the doctor bill in school to which in fee is
My daughter, I know who she is
And all my sons know exactly what being free is
No, you might not get the drop-top three
But all your kids want to be like me
Their father, and even when times is getting harder
There's only one name you could trust, Kris Parker
Uh
Send this out to you
You and yours... word
It's that time yo... that's word"

'Cause if the dogs don't get 'em
The cattle get 'em, or the gat'll get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em
Time for spiritual activism, life is a journey
And Kris got the map with him
Teach latinos and blacks with 'em
It's amazing when whites and asians kick raps with 'em
Cause out of a thousand MC's, believe I taught half of 'em
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, I beam through many images
My origin is a mystery like capstones on pyramids
We live it kid, challenge the teacher you will regret that
I'm giving careers and taking careers away, did you forget that?
* Better check that, you can rock this track and the next track
* But when I correct the spirit hit, you'll always be set back
So gather round now for the raptism
Only those that got hip-hop in 'em
And not rap in 'em and no crack with 'em
Step up now and receive a holy dose
From a holy host, and take a break from these rappers that only boast
*

* My intellectual battle will make your brains rattle
* I'll unwrap you and your crew from the same shackle
I'm on many different planes like a airport
Psychologically you be rethinkin your identity and cuttin' ya hair short
Now there's a thought, that exposes your insecurity
You put no fear in me, I break the M from the C
* And reverse it to say ""See 'em? See 'em?""
* They allow the devil to lead 'em, and they be givin' up they freedom
So, huh, gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Wake up
When the spirit hear it the lyric long before the track get 'em
{HWC} Wake up
I spit 'em out, gotta get 'em out, the world I never been about
I see them glitter but their spirit's goin' in and out
We see them fading, we also see them hating
We also see those living for musical chart ratings
Hear what I'm stating or trading for what you're paying
Replace fear with faith and you'll stop decaying
Gather round for the raptism (word)
Gather round for the raptism (word, word)
{HWC} Wake up, wake up, wake up
* Gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Make up, make up, make up
* 'Cause if the dogs don't get 'em

158,The Truth,1995,KRS-One (1995),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, her truth is not hard
It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, gimme the truth!
Listen to the lyric as the negative is shrinkin
It's shrinkin out your life when you decide to change your thinkin'
One of the first things we gotta switch around of course
Is Jesus Christ, and him dying on the cross
You're looking at the cross, surrounded in it's mystery
With Jesus on the cross in a, total misery
Now separate Jesus from the cross so you can see
The truth about the cross, and the cross's history
The cross was created by the Roman government
It's only purpose and use is capital punishment
But Jesus Christ was all about the revolution
While the cross was used as Jesus Christ's execution
See what if Jesus Christ was hung upon a tree
Upon every church wall, that's exactly what you'd see
If Jesus Christ was shot in the head with no respect
We'd all have little gold guns around our neck
If Jesus Christ was killed in electic chair, now get it
You'd be knealing to the electric chair with Jesus still in it
You gaze upon the cross and you see the execution
You yell stop the violence but the cross you're still using
It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, her truth is not hard
It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, gimme the truth!
So I say listen, listen, open up your third eye vision
God is not down with religion
Religion they be sellin it, listen up, God is intelligent
Reading of the bible is irrelevant
You gotta look within yourself, not a scripture
KRS-One comes to rearrange the God picture
If you sit and believe, you can achieve
If you sit and accept, you don't know, what's correct or incorrect
Take for instance Adam and Eve
The first two people on the planet, or so you believe
Their first time in heaven kids they had, Cain and Abel
Huh, now let me show you, why the story's unstable
According to the story, according to what you believe
There was only Cain, Abel, Adam, and Eve
On the whole planet, now use your intellect
And tell me, what did Cain and Abel do for sex?
Upon the whole planet there was not another
Could it be for sex, heh, they were looking at each other?
Hold up! I thought the church wasn't into that
But wait, still yet, there is another fact
How did the world get populated? Now tell me if I'm wrong
But obviously Eve had it goin' on
Think for a minute, I know it gets notorious
But yo G, check out the chorus
It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, her truth is not hard
It's not natural, if it goes against God
It's not factual, gimme the truth!
Yo yo...
Yo bring that back
I wanna say something on this BlastMaster session
Yo this is Rich Nice
You brothers gotta stop treating these hoes like nice girls
And these nice girls like hoes
True indeed, I'd like to welcome the rebirth of the Goddess
Word up it's all about knowledge of self
Yo Busta Rhymes, why don't you take the session over from here"

Hip-Hop is the way we live

If you're down for this nation, Hip-Hop the nation
Three generations, fourth in the waitin
Look at what we facin, mainstream penetration
Everyone's a biter now, no innovation
No syncopation, lost communication
Here's what we gotta do to fix the situation
First step - know what you creatin'
Hip-Hop the culture, the consciousness, a new civilization

Redo the industry with a two dollar royalty

Don't look at me like I'm insane, the facts remain plain
You to blame, when you take it in vein
The gains and struggles and pains of those that already came
From the beginning we tried to attain, the money and fame
That's not new to the game, it's still the same
But what seems to change is the loyalty
Rappers degrade hip-hop for a royalty
It's all about me and my click and we ballin G
But we fallin', stallin our callin to be free
You can't see, they're gonna judge our poetry
In two-thousand and twenty-three, where will your money be?
Where will your Benz be? Your friends be?
Your beginnin be? Your end be? Gently

But behind my back you condemn me, you a thief!

I need God in my life
I need family and friends

I need world peace, homeless to eat, no drugs
I need every race and creed to be one

You need to listen to Kris
You need to have peace at least
You need spiritual bliss
You need a lyrical twist
Do you know what a miracle is?
Before we begin, you may need a kiss
I suggest either one from J to O-one from the lips
Either way what I'm saying, yo, is bound to uplift
You need checks, you need cash
You need intellect
You need to be moving fast
You need that big respect
You need to be rolling in a car
Going to a bar that's far
Makin' the deal to make you a star
You need to ask yourself, now do you know who you are?
Where you goin'? How many steps you took so far?
You need patience, you need to control your mind
If you read and don't act, then you're wasting your time
We need better leaders, we need better preachers
We need a three-thousand dollar raise to all teachers

You need rejuvenation
You need assistance right now with your situation
You need some contemplation
You need a combination
A combination of will power and concentration
You need some syncopation
With regular relaxation

You need to slow down, maybe you should speed up
One sayin' ""lay down,"" the other's sayin' ""leap up""
You gotta keep up
I suggest you start to speak up
A lawyer, a doctor, a rapperóyou wanna be what?
Whatever it is, you gotta visualize
You need to focus for real, and stop livin' them lies

Yo, you need to be wise
Yo, you need to be alive, there could be no revenge or deceit in your eyes
Rise!

Gimme what I need
Do it with speed
Change the situation around, plant new seeds!
I roll with a righteous team of adults
Forget the insults
We plan to get results
You can call us a cult, you can call us a gang
But when it comes to Hiphop, no, you cats can't hang
When the Gatts go bang
And the telephone rang
Telling you to come to identify the remains
That's when you feel the pain
And my name comes as comfort, ease and all stress and strain
You need to know the game
You need to know the meaning of your own name
Reprogram your own brain
Ask questions with no shame
How you think you gonna master your craft if you don't train?
Perfecting your skill, that's the aim
Perfect your skill, and you'll always have money and fame
C'mon!

But let me tell you bout God and the way that She works
I mean the way that He works, I mean the way that We work
You gotta trust in your Lord, everything is in accord
Don't rush or fuss, you gonna get yours
Close your eyes, your heart, your ears, your mind
To the ways and thoughts of mankind
And seek ye first the Kingdom of God
And things won't seem so hard
You gotta trust your Lord, uh, uh... tell 'em bout
Trust and obey, trust when afraid
Trust when you paid, trust when betrayed
Trust when you fear, trust when you unclear
Trust when you here, trust when you near
Trust when you down, trust when you found
Trust when you clown, trust
C'mon, let's do it again, uh, uh
Let's raise it up, c'mon, look
(KRS-One)
After you live and you learn then you see
You will learn how to trust in your G-O-D
You will be so free, you won't see no me
You will only see the will of the almighty
You sick of what? Well ya will, give it up
Stop thinkin' and begin to, live it up
Everytime you think it's one way it's not
Everytime you wanna start you really stop
Trust in the inner the outer is for the sinners
In fact this whole rap is for beginners
Those that have talked and walked upon the path
Know that they get what they want before they act
So why rush, if your respect is due
Whatever you DON'T have is protectin you
Here's what you DO have that be bringin' the drama
Ask and it shall be given, with a comma
{*Singers*}
You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends
You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends
(KRS-One)
Uh uh, soundin good, soundin good, look, look
So when will you be it, when will you see it
That thoughts and things they manifest when you decree it
But God be lookin' out for you
Puttin' a stop to what you're about to do
In your life, and in your circumstances
Everytime you speak you be takin' chances
Talkin' bout things that you really don't have to have
So when you get 'em, your life turns sad
Your life turns bad, now why would your God be allowin that?
Trust in God, that's where the crown is at
It's not in what you get, it's what happens after that
So if you think your life is shrinkin
It may be cause you keep thinkin'
Not that intellect is wrong
It's just the beginning, it might be time to move on"
164,Uh Oh,1993,Return of the Boom Bap (1993),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"You ain't that tough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end
You walk around the town like you a big man
But you never know now that there's always a bigger man
You sling the M-16 and flash the M-1
But you don't know what you're doing never learned to handle one
But true! All you friend thinking you a gangster
While your mother tried to warn you from certain danger
So when you in your room you playing with your Mac-10
Fully loaded automatic, just you and a friend
You posing aw dey mirror like you a gangster clown
But the Mac-10 go off and you friend go down
Uh oh! What you gonna do now?
Uh oh! They gonna blame you somehow
Uh oh! Tell me what you gonna say
Uh oh! Look, they cutting you away
Your father telling you ""Now son just go to school
Don't go acting like a fool and don't go acting too cool""
You get to the school and meet up with the right bunch
Just a group of kids with no names taking people lunch
You join the click because you wanna meet some girls
And you want a little prestige in you little school world
One day you're walking with your crew along the road
And a member of your crew pull out a gun and unload
He shoot a parked car and all you run far
You and your friends laughing like you a superstar
And you get home and you thinking it was fresh
And a cop meet you there with a warrant for your arrest
Them ask, ""Who shot the gut why you walking down the street
Didn't you see the little boy there in the back seat sleep?
Now the boy dead we want to know from you
Who shot the car up, are we gonna take you?""
Uh oh! Now what you gonna do now?
Uh oh! Boy, them gonna blame you
Uh oh! Now tell me what you gonna say
Uh oh! Look, they cutting you away
White kids! You living in the whitest part of town
You are a white kid but you know you hang around
So you and your friends thinking that you are all of that
When you see a youth walk by and yes the youth is black
One kid say ""Hey, what you doing on the block
We don't want no niggers here unless he is a cop""
So the kid pull out a big baseball bat
And them him slap with the bat because the kid is black
Now then the kid fell down but still alive
So he reach in his pants and pull out a four-five
Pop! One friend drop and everyone run
Out of all the white kids now you the only one
You start cry, cause now you gonna die
And it's all because what your friends did to this guy
Uh oh! What you gonna do now?
Uh oh! He gonna blame you somehow
Uh oh! What you think you gonna say?
Uh oh! Now them cutting you away

An-an-an-and it's about to il-il-il-ill *echoes*""
Let me introduce you to another type of rapper MC
Where glamour and glitter don't matter gently
I'm tired of the Chattanooga empty
Classical like a German luger
Deep like a tune for scuba diving who am I the hyper
Like I said before my radar's going BIBBIT BIBBIT
The microphone I grip-it grip-it, lyric lyric I live it
Hear it my spirit is where it should be
Don't push me if you pussy, HUH
I spot em, it seems you want to ride the dillz
I got em, KRS got skills in the place
I waste megahertz of bass bottom, chill
As I rock 'em and get ill, I build the perfect spot to kill
Verbal excitement will lead to your indictment
Whether or not you like it, still, number one I hype it
Your album, rewrite it
How many MC's, wannabemceez
Never be MC's, 'cause they can't MC
How many MC's, wannabemceez
Never be MC's, 'cause they can't MC
Triplet syllables for minimal criminals
Lyrical riddles that got hard flavors in the middle
Sit back and chittle as I stand and still rebuild on skills
The admission of serial lyrics, calculated to weaken the spirit
Will be diverted by this lyric when you hear it
Ricochet any style any day
Any which way and you'll Cherish the Day like Sade
The advanced oratorical techniques I speak
Keep the heat at full peak! My grammar
With stamina, grabs a rapper like the fresh catch of the day
And crack the back of that DJ
I'm strappin and attackin a pack
And whatever happens after that just happens, FACT
Flamboyant and flashy is one point in time when you're not ashy
Focus on the syllable formats and the cash G
G for guard your grill, I'm hard to kill
Odd but ill, a job to fill is to refill on skills
We built and killed style and skill
While poetically recriminate you like a child I will
Get ill, and switch to earn
'Cause I prefer to slur but not blur
Blurring you're stirring up trouble surely you don't need it
Be seated I'm undefeated dem not see it
Observe me then beat it
How many MC's, wannabemceez
Never be MC's, 'cause they can't MC
How many MC's, wannabemceez
Never be MC's, 'cause they can't MC
Let's get back to the point quickly, get with me
The voice from New York City is too witty
I come from a era of ?OJ cars?, Latin Quarter
Fake Gucci and fake Fendi, you can't send me
Nowhere, that I ain't been to
You can't tell me nuttin that I ain't been through
Disrespect the teacher I gots to get you
*'Cause they can't MC*
But what you really sayin'
You sound like a bitch-ass rapper when he's saying
""Yo Kris you hit too hard"" stop playing!
Switching and swaying
Day in and day out, your styles are played out, see you way out
Before you're laid out, your bright lights start to fade out
The last thing you heard is ""Who let the K out?""
?No great area?
Everything is black and white we took the gray out it's scarier
Either you're winnin' or losin, spinnin the rules of conscience
But lyrically there ain't no stoppin'
I'm droppin' a lot in your noggin
'Cause I know that you're lyrically starvin
Carbon, your name, battle battle
Everybody wants to battle but you BAB-BLE
Who knows ya, battlin me, is the only way that you can gain exposure
I feel for ya soldier
I hate to say it but I told ya so
You know that I know the ancient flow KRS-One
Is the holder of a boulder yo, money folder yo
You want a fresh style let me show you slow
Your blow, I'm not your foe
Battling me? No no no no no no NO!

[Student] Yo it's the rule of the people. The self rule.
[Student] It's what the people want!
[K] That's right. But is this a democracy?
[S] Nah, democracy is a goal to be attained.
[K] That's right. The character of the people should be reflected
[K] in the laws and the institution of the state.
[S] Psssh, I don't see my character reflected!
[K] Tell me
(Chorus One: KRS-One)
WHY, are all the schools they fallin' apart
And WHY, the youth not takin' no musical art
And WHY, the professionals really don't know where to start
No, one, really, cares, about
WHY, the people ain't trustin the law and the order
And WHY, the hookers from 70's look like our daughters
And WHY, the radio station they help with the slaughter
No, one, really, cares, about
(KRS-One)
The mind, they usin' until it's time they doin' a rhyme
Will ruin what you doin' if you crime pursuin
Let me tell you bout gettin' your family out the mean ghetto
To green meadows, where you can finally be settled
That street level, freak level, pullin out heat level
Eatin meat level, deceit level, that's that beast level
You gotta stand upright in a house with three levels
Where you don't even see devils unless he shovels the snow
Many philosophers live on the low
Never crazy hazy or lazy we get up and go
Whaddya know, I'm always teaching after the show
Not messin with hoes, I'm with my wife, changin my clothes
Blowin' my nose, deliverin blows to foes
With new flows; then disappear where nobody knows
'Cause I got too many questions, too many lessons
I gotta go, too many people stressin but I gotta know
(Chorus Two: KRS-One)
WHY, these officers gunnin us down on our block
And WHY, the President never steps in on these cops
And WHY, the mayor don't even look like he in shock
No, one, really, cares, about
WHY, the call of the poor is always ignored
And WHY, the senators governors breakin the law
And WHY, they taxin and taxin and taxin the poor
No, one, really, cares, about
(KRS-One)
You, me, or themselves you can tell, they livin' in hell
But they come on the TV lookin' so swell
Sellin you dreams of schemes of you gettin' green and cream
But they never explain the work and all it means
You got to visualize, close the lid on your eyes
And visualize, minimize lies
See yourself bigger in size, quicker to rise up
Wise up climb up, before your time's up but
(Chorus One)
[S] The votes
[K] That's right
[S] The politics
[K] That's right
[S] The government you know!
[K] Uh-huh, people basically have the government they want
[S] If people felt dissed, they'd be out rebellin right now"
173,Woke Up,2006,Life (2006),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"(KRS-One)
Y'know
There's a difference between dreamin', and visualizin
Which one are you doin'?
Food gone up, gasoline up
Full-time employment passin me up
Bills pilin up, really this sucks
I need a couple bucks, really I'm stuck
Here comes a truck, pullin right up
It says Brinks, now I'm thinkin' what's up
But nah, what I'm thinkin' about, yo duck
20 30 40 shots at the truck
I'm duckin runnin' jumpin' lookin' for what?
Some cover for this brother, EVERYTHING'S NUTS~!
But yo, I can see some others with gats
Brinks firin, they firin back
Rat, ta-tat-ta-ta-tat-ta-ta, tat
Then I woke up...
Doctor help me out, what's this all about
What's this condition I gotta figure out
Am I really out, that I really doubt
Give me the remedy, what is the amount?
Whatever you tellin' me sellin me compellin me
Yo the light in me ain't out
Anyway I enter cats remember
Knowledge I sent ya forever they shout
South bronx! south bronx!
South bronx! south bronx!
Then I woke up...
Well I guess I'm out on my own
With this condition it won't be long
Before for sure my little sanity's gone
I'm livin' off of nuttin, losin my home
Kids in the street, wife alone
I want to sell this very microphone
But then my friend the light was shown
It came through my inner cellular phone
Get up and get out my spirit will shout
Commitment is what love is really about
No down and no out, just up and about
I think I'm gonna take the spiritual route
Then I woke up...
Then I realized I'm out of my purpose
Out of my purp', not doin' my work
I went on a search, inside of myself
For true health, love awareness and wealth
I went to the Temple and opened my mental
I learned that I'm the cause of all that I been through
Your whole environment is really within you
Reach inside your heart and write a new menu
I'ma be the change that I want to see
Now I can see, that I'm really free
Everything is really always somethin' else
Tell yourself a different story 'bout self
Do you have the courage to be you
All that talk, that you talk, is it really you?
Oh silly you, oh silly me
Your tongue is killin' YOU, not killin' me
I'm feelin' free, to be, just what I wanna be
Easily, you see, 'cause I woke up...
When I woke up, my debt went down
My locks broke up, my rent went down
My stocks went up, my car sped up
My pockets swell up, my life I found
I'm not so fed up it's time to get up
A clear mind switched my life around
Now I can see where the help is at
The health love awareness and wealth is at
'Cause I woke up...
'Cause I woke up! I woke up!
When I woke up, I woke up
That's when I woke up
Play that back"
174,Woop! Woop! (Showbiz Remix),2003,D.I.G.I.T.A.L. (2003),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Woop-woop!
That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!
Verse One:
Stand clear! Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out! We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack
But you be doin' that
I'd rather say ""see ya""
'Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer? You WICKED overseer!
Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
'Cause we be getting HYPED to the sound of da police!
Verse Two:
Now here's a likkle truth
Open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word ""overseer,"" like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patroling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way
Verse Three:
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up till today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary
Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My GREAT grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!"
175,Ya Feel Dat,2003,Kristyles (2003),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"Ya feel dat? (HO!) Ya see dat? (HO!)
Ya hear dat? (HO!) You believe dat? (HO!)
Ya follow dat? (HO!) Could it be dat? (HO!)
Ya follow dat? (HO!) Can you believe dat? (HO!)
Ya hear dat? (HO!) Ya see dat? (HO!)
You believe dat? (HO!) You can feel dat (HO!)
Ya follow dat? (HO!) You believe dat? (HO!)
Ya see dat? (HO!)
(Verse One)
Show me an MC that think he's too hot
Bring him to KRS-One, I'll show him he's NOT
Blowin' the whole spot up when I spit up
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, when I walk past, get up
My wrists ain't lit up! I don't even live that life
Gold, diamonds, platinum, I give to my wife - you see
Diamonds are a girl's best friend, not mine
You got it, FINE - but what about that rhyme?
Can you rhyme? Can you spit it quick
Like watermelon pits at a picnic? Ha!
Or are you just dressed up with nowhere to go?
Or is the record company the pimp and you the ho?
Let's go!
[Chorus] w/ variations
(Verse Two)
I write my own books like I write my own hooks
Step in the spot and these rappers be so shook
They don't look here cause KRS is BOOM!
Platinum rappers be hidin out in they dressin rooms
Yo, get away from me
You got a million dollar video but I'M the one they wanna see
The capital E-M-C-E-E
A repitition of words, I been divorced Melodie
I'm out, confident, no doubt
I get what I gotta get when I spit I don't shout
This New Yorker, Kris Parker's a quick talker
You can get what I spit or get the klik-klocker
Overseas I got the breeze as a hip-hopper
Where they speak eat and drop the beats proper
Street doctor, I'm +Brown+ and +Foxy+ like the +Ill Nana+
Whoever you think is hot, I'm hotter
[Chorus] w/ variations
(Verse Three)
RADIO! These suckers never play me
Or Chuck - but do you think we really give a...
Southside, Westside, Eastside, North
I spit the hot flame, you get your flesh torn off
I come from that place where you cats can't face
Where cops can't chase or invade my space
We turn up the bass, you tremble in the place
Phones ain't traced and flows we don't waste
Hoes we don't chase or kiss, they know they place
With Kris or Christ, they'll lose their life
You don't lose if you come in two's, you and a wife
But you crews wanna be bruised, so choose your knife
Choose your gat, choose your rat, when the smoke clears
You'll be like, ""God damn - who was that?""
Loosen that noose around your neck and back
Embarassin blacks, ain't no respect in that!
[Chorus] w/ variations
(KRS-One)
Let's do it! (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)
Everybody up top! (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)
Yo, all my cats in the front! (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)
Yo, yo, all my cats in the back (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)
Yo, we out!"
176,You Gon Go,2004,Keep Right (2004),Hip Hop,KRS-One,"(Verse 1: KRS-One)
I'm bringing back the style that others have pushed to the rear
Now you see me, now you don't, now I'm everywhere
Maybe you can see that knowledge does reign supreme
Rap is like a ballclub and I coach the team
Move the crowd, that's what MC mean
How many albums I got? Mmmm... 12, 13
I've told y'all before
You are not just doin' hip-hop, you are hip-hop
Them jokers need to stop, be hip-hop
I mastered this and him, her, they, them, that one
She and he did not
I speak a lot
I hit 'em in they weakest spot
Come see me rock, yo, you'll leave in shock
KRS, you ever wonder why he's so hot?
It's because he's not pop yo, he's hip-hop
West to East the sound of the police will rock
If you don't love this you won't have the heat I got
Disciplined if you listening the beats (?)
Fuck the dumb shit yo, we gotta teach the tots
They say I preach a lot
And last year the took the jeep and shot
But this year the beat will knock
(Hook x2: KRS-One)
I know where
We can go
To see how a real MC flow
No video
No radio
Just a live show
C'mon now you gon' go?
(Verse 2: KRS-One)
I'm still standing, demanding playing my lex jammin'
Cats wanna really see me start blam-blammin'
Put away the cannon for this overstandin'
I'm landin'
Let the music play like Shannon
I'm so hot, why not, I bring all the fans in
Watch me now come alive like Peter Frampton
Listen to me people, listen to me loud and clear
It's time I found out what type of people up in here
When I shout out the classic if you know it say yeah
South Bronx-Yeah!
My Philosophy-Yeah!
Black Cop-Yeah!
You Must Learn-Yeah!
Yeah we gonna do it up in here
I'm still standin'
And rappers be mad-mad
'Cause they know they'll give birth like the American
Flag in Baghdad
All they do is blab-blab, that head chatter
Why the dopest MC always a dead rapper?
I'm a real live rapper, I'm out to set it
I pay dues, while your crews still on credit
You talk that shit till I come out the school
And all y'all sound like Trina sayin' ""That's Cool""
Time for the streets again
Time for them cats to pop gats into the mic you speakin' in
I'm creepin' in with a hundred soldiers
When I step on the stage it's over
(Verse 3: KRS-One)
They don't play me a lot
KRS you don't see a lot
On TV a lot, but I do MC a lot
I don't duck and hide when I see the cops
I'm free with the knowledge to free the block
Live on the radio I'm sendin' my rhyme, you can see
I'm behind enemy lines
You already heard about plenty of crime
Now hear about the sciences that could really open ya mind
I only got a little bit of time to rhyme before the
Producer over here says ""Ok, that's fine""
So let's get to it, I got my whole squad with me
On top'a all that I got God with me
You can go far with me
From New York, to Atlanta, to LA
You know they all with me
You might not see me on this station cause this is a
Rapcity and KRS leads a Hip-Hop nation
Even though y'all chase ends
Why can't weeeeee be friends, it all depends
Cats wanna thug it out
Isn't it true that Hip-Hop was bigger when we all loved it out?
Look at the difference in raps
See when I'm spittin' the facts
Louder than anyone could rap, the industry collapse
No one's special anymore
Variety is gone for sure"
