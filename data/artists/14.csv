Keep me runnin' from the werewolf, owww
Howling at the moon on the roof
Eh, ah, no, get em
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have 'em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him (Woo!)
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Trieed to strike back
Left him like that, layin up with the white hat
Gettin' right back at ya when I snatch ya (Aight!)
Up out the grave, nothin' but bones and ashes
Hittin niggaz with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red (Heeey!)
But this girl gave me head for free
'Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003 (2003!)
That Nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He went through like 20 G's and thought that
I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinkin' and eventually
Found that's what you get for stinkin
Blowin' up the spot when you rot
Plus if it gets hot they know you dipped
For four squared blocks
Hit 'em with the ox to the grill
Eh, ah, kill nigga kill
Yet still they don't know I'ma rob who
That dog DMX is a muthafuckin problem"
1,"4,3, 2, 1",2002,The DMX Files (2002),Hip Hop,DMX,"Hah hah

Trizack that sound like heaven
Seven six five four three two one
My mon meth-tical come and get some
Playin' my position, hot nixon
This one, for all the sick ones, confliction
Posionous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itchin with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, g-o-d no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly, tap your jaw
From my punch, watch your son and you
Got you shittin in your last huggie, runnin' who?
Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump comin' through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu
Aiyyo I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin' christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin your ex hoe
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin
Shit I'm drivin' in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be takin' notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolut, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin' till your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic
Stay out the dark, 'cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dawg, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possesions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, 'cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? one deep, leave him behind, front seat
Aiyyo, one two three four

Blaze the hot trizack
Ahine like heaven
Seven six five four

Come on Mr. Smith, come get some!
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewher cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with mike
Swingin' at ken griffey or challengin roy to a fight
Snappin, you ameteur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the dream team tourin overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin' a tiger cub to his knees (uh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line
LL Cool J nigga, greatest of all time"

3,A Minute For Your Son,2001,The Great Depression (2001),Hip Hop,DMX,"You got a minute for yo' son Father, I need to talk
I'm so tired of tryin to run Father, let's take a walk
I'm so sorry for what I done Father, it ain't my fault
But the devil's been on my back lately, he's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle, but it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual, but I need you God
Lot of things that I used to, I don't wanna
Run the streets like I used to, I know I'm gonna
Speak the word for you one day, up in there like
""Hallelujah!"" on Sunday, I thank you Lord
For the blessings that you gave me, and for my life
With the blessings you have saved me, and for my wife
You have carried me enough times, and that's the truth 
Married me to rough times, throughout my youth
And through it all I saw that you was still with me
I was that one lost sheep, and you was comin' to get me
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
I look at life a little different now, since you hugged me
And I always loved my peoples, but now they love me
Thank you for the love Lord, we praise you
Jacob's descendants, from Africa to Asia
Pleadin' the blood of Christ over our life, wrong or right
Just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout yo' name in times of need
And times of joy, and when we bleed
And, when we are overcome with greed
You ain't gon' half to tell me twice, I'ma take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I, never knew I had
Kept the heart good when they, told me it was bad
All praises due to ya, That's why I had
To dedicate somethin' new to ya, thank you Father
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord (
) you got me like, your love got me like
I never knew a love like, this before
Messin' with the thug life I, missed it all
You opened the doors and, let me in
I'm down for the cause so, let's begin
Prayers that you give to me I, give to them
Same way you live in me I, live in them
Life is a blessing now, you got me
Smilin' from inside of my heart, when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain anymore, only sunshine
No pain anymore, I really love mine
You washed away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, the whole thirty years
You know that, one day I'll speak the word
You know that, when I do I will be heard
You know that, you gave me a permanent smile
And you know this Father because, I'm yo' child (
)
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord you got me like, your love got me like
Lord you got me like, your love got me like

7,Against The Grain,1998,Unleashed & Unreleased (1998),Hip Hop,DMX,"Yo, remix joint...
(I gots to make a move and make it soon
I gots to take a block and make it boom) x2
Goin' Against the grain... Know what I'm sayin'? Ye-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shit's about to jump off and
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north
Been like three years since when got knocked
Since he got caught
Punked up like five new blocks, holding down for it
Kept a nigga straight with money in the books
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks
Took him shopping, money in his pocket is straight
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate
Our estate was the next move for me
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months
'Cause when it's on, it's on (that's my plate!)
He didn't care
It's like slow down baby
The money ain't going nowhere (what?)
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it
Watch a nigga just coming home in a game
Cause on the low we may just be trying to go (go down) against the grain
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled
What is strange is the change that niggaz go through
When they're locked down and really can't hack it
A motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket
Strap it on my back, niggaz ain't built like me
And by the end, niggaz was like ""Yo, why you killed Mike, D?
Wasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him
Used to be my man, so I let my cousin do him (we open up shop! It's four in the mornin!)
Sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA
Cause the money comes quick
Half of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him
But things happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him
Got him up out of there and sent him down a little further
Ain't heard from him in two months, murder, murder (ah!)
And from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something
This hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (fo-fo!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
Man, listen, money is missing and shit is hectic
Found the safe, checked it
Shit looks detected
Just what I expected when I got no word from him
Asked around but ain't nobody heard from him (cash long!)
But money talks and most niggaz is snakes
So it wasn't long before his man was ready to take
Me to where he was at, checked my gat
Threw in a four clip, pumped myself up
'Cause I can't go for that bullshit
Fuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue
It's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you
Takin' back for niggaz in New York and how they told me so
Now I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough
Layin' up with a hoe, then he hit me with the sob story
The famous ""Oh you didn't know I got robbed!"" story
Told it's to me he should be grateful to
Fuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do
Now there's love lost and a double cross
Pointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce
So you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly
Five bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys
Ten g's in the shoebox under the bed
And for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head
And from then, the moral of the story if you missed it
Is the grand is always gonna be there (why nigga?)
Just never go against it"

Ain't no way you niggaz wanna stop mine
Ya niggaz must be out yo mind, I don't know why
What the fuck is you niggaz pressin me for

If I was testin your jaw, maybe then you would respect me
But you can't respect me 'cause you don't even know me
Nigga check me (come on)
I'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin'
Then die from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin'
Bad decisions lead to last decisions
Fast collision, now yo ass is missin' (what)
Take it over there now you bring it back to the streets
Have you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth?
Let me break it down for you he's about to attack you
Still standin here faggot? You must want me to smack you
You ain't been there or done that, fuck is y'all niggaz tellin' me
I'm the only nigga, walkin' the streets with four felonies
But peep this, I see shit is hard, niggaz is strugglin
But leave rap alone for little while, go back to hustlin

Hit 'em in a rhyme because I'm an MC
Been a lot of places most niggaz won't, see
That's why I'm at a level that y'all niggaz won't, be
Let your man hold somethin' now he want, more
You ain't no fuckin' killer what was the front, for
It was a time when the world was at your front, door
Now they change places niggaz want, raw
Niggaz laugh at me and was mad at me
'Cause the way life was goin' had to be a, tragedy
But after me, it's over, I'ma take the whole verse
I'm tryin' to keep it real that's why I let y'all niggaz go first
But you look to get force right in the mouth
Didn't appreciate what you got when you got it so if I see it, I'ma tot it
Where to hide it you gotta car better drive it
The fuck up outta here and hope and pray I don't pull up along side it
Come on
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggaz you just don't know

Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggaz wanna stop mine
Ya niggaz must be out yo mind, I don't know why
Niggaz don't know so I gotta flip
It seem they've forgotten how dark it could get
Barks like a pit scratch when I hit
We both know you pussy but you stay talkin' shit
What I'ma have to do dog, run up in yo mess
Catch you while you comfortable put one up in yo chest
One up in yo vest of course pay the hollows
And blown away today you just lost tomorrow
I'ma go platinum (nah) you gots to be kiddin WHY
Make it double platinum, no bullshittin
And I'ma stay flippin flows, rippin shows
Strippin ho's, gettin' dough let me go
And nigaz know, who the best is
The dog, DMX is the rest is or might as well be helpless
I wreck this 'cause when I wreck shit
I might snatch a niggaz necklace
Then go from like midnight to breakfast
Come on
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggaz you just don't know
But niggaz is about to go oh no oh no

God loves you, yes he does
Said you're all right with him
I wonder
I know you never seen him but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
'Cause you're all right with him
I said you're all right with him
I know you never seen him but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
'Cause you're all right with him
I said you're all right with him
I'm callin' out to you Lord, because I need your help
See once again I'm havin' difficulty, savin' myself
Behavin' myself, you told me what to do and I do it
But every and now and then, gets a little harder to go through it
Losin' friends, day by day
I'm in so much pain when I'm here Lord, please take me away
I will, my Lord, with my heart, and my soul
That's gonna be how I roll, from now until I mold
Lead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow
I'ma sleep on what you said, and holla back tomorrow
I know you never seen him but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him

I said you're all right with him
I know you never seen him but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
You're all right with him
I said you're all right with him
I want you to know Lord, that for what you've given me I'm thankful
Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful
You gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak
And that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach
Can't tell 'em nothin' wrong, 'cause I love 'em too much
I reach a lot of people, and Lord I'm lovin' the touch
But deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against
Everything I know is right, what I know makes sense
I know you never seen him but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
'Cause you're all right with him
I said you're all right with him
I know you never seen him but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
'Cause you're all right with him
I said you're all right with him
My Lord, my savior, don't judge my behavior
But instead, take what's in my heart, and put it in my head
See I guess I really never knew, how proud I made you
My life is yours, my soul I gave you
I don't know if I'll do good enough (
)
And we both know the hood is rough (
)
Sometimes I don't know what to do (
)
But I know what I gotta do (
)
You keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song
Talk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong
This is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start of it
Praises to you my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it
I was that kid that, been there, did that
Became ashamed so I hid that, but, ain't no longer with that
Use me as an example, if I can do it, then they can too
With the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do
I know you never seen him but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him

I know you never seen him but don't fight with him

It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste
'Cause he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, yes
Ain't a whole lot to braking a nigga down fast
They call me black 'cause that's how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet
But ain't a fuckin' thing going down till I eat
So can I beef? You betta while you still got teeth
'Cause they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make ya shit drop out
Popped out, through a you know what
'Cause you know why, and you know my
Motherfuckin name up in this game
And bitch, you know I

Niggaz throw us on they album, try to boost they sales
We put our pies on the table and our eyes on a label
Cause them rednecks up in the mountains'll try to slay you
(They call me) Raspy, tell you what I want you to know
Fuck what you ask me - you probably don't, want me to blow
I got a lot of horsepower so I'm able to skip
Usually a good nigga, even though I'm able to flip
You pay 30 for the 'Kiss (uh-huh) a 100 for The L.O.X. (yeah)
And if we cool, then I write a hook for a drop
Whatever's in the bank is my bet, a z-bull's my pet
And you can bet he'll get the legs and the neck
Uh-huh, yeah, aiyyo
Yo when my gun bust, send niggaz to the fish like Swanson
New York's youngest Bumpy Johnson, I put fear in y'all heads
Sheik Luc', type of nigga gasoline y'all beds
And that's warnin, if you all alive in the mornin, that's fine
Now I suggest you hit the block and get what's rightfully mine
I want PC - see me? Tuck in your chains
I got niggaz my pop's age that lifestyle ain't changed
It's like wake up, move a brick, half of it slow
Make car money, check with Sheik, go fuck with a hoe
I rock a waist length mink, do-rag under my fitted
And I don't even want waves, Timbs be halfway new
That's Sheik in the dress-up club 'cause I don't fuck with shoes
And for my nigga's life, I swear to the Bible, let it be told
I put thirty in your head, all in the same hole
'Cause we got the same goal, and you try an' tamper with mine?
Don't make me motherfuckin leave you with some shit in yo' spine
Fuck with me you be a WAS nigga, nigga WAS dope
Nigga WAS gettin' money 'fore I extorted your coke, 'ju crazy?
Aiyyo, catch me with a thirty-eight, box and shells
In a ninety-eight Lincoln eatin pasta shells
Order to go, always got a box of L's
Blow, stay on the low, get a Heine' and swig
I'm Pinero, so I hate a snake, rat, or a pig
I pop shit 'cause I'm the second best, the first was B.I.G.
Y'all niggaz is son-ned out, let me speak to your father
'Cause I like to play chess and I swing the revolver
If I don't like a nigga, I don't even be bothered
I spit, I'm just a crooked nigga goin' legit
You hold your nine if you holdin' a brick
Common sense, Fed drama, you hit the Bahamas, get bent
L.O.X. get respect like Sonny from ""Bronx Tale""
Us and DMX, the Ruff Ryder cartel
Thirsty to live, are y'all niggaz eager to die?
I tell all my niggaz ride, you won't leave with a dime
Motherfucker
Yeah, yeah
I'm a monster, I sleep whole winters; wake up and spit summers
Ghetto nigga, puttin' up Will Smith numbers
Surrounded by 6's and Hummers, bitches among us
Tryin' not to let this bullshit become us
It started from hunger, till it all went insane
Now bitches notice the chains now that I hit my number
The chickens I twisted see the digits unlisted
The beeper done changed; you dead bitch, the Reaper done came
I suggest niggaz stop speakin' my name
Cause trust me, y'all can still feel the heat in the rain
I keep creepin', streets keep watchin, I keep poppin'
Niggaz is hot heads and the bullets is heat-seekin'
Jay flow for pesos -- chase hoes NOT
I just circle 'round the block in a drop
Tell them jump through the top (uh-huh)
Where the sun roof used to be
I could see y'all not used to me
Nigga flows like none other - I'm the meanest toughest Don Dada, the gun butcher
You the type that bust a lot of shots and none touch ya
I'm the type that get excited, when the gun touch ya
Motherfuckers...
Y'all niggaz bout to witness a dynasty like no other
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr... I'm headed nowhere fast

All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (yes)
Like the wind blow
Yeah, uh
From 80 school street to way across town
Cats knew how I got down cause word got around
I was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch a nigga out the door slippin' that's yo ass
Didn't laugh much 'cause I didn't have much
Life was like a stick half gas half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
What was good if I caught a good vic if I didn't I was bad
Took it out on my regulars
I come through and if niggaz was broke I took watches and sneakers
Went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me
All it taught me was how not to be sloppy
An older cat robbed me when I was like 10
If anybody wanted to help they should've did it then
But they didn't and all it did was release the beast
So I'm a feast on whatever I come across in the streets
Like the wind (like the wind)
God will take (god will take)
All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Blooown
I had a ""S"" on my chest fuck the vest
Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
Other time I came thought with just me and my dog
And clear out the whole fuck block 'cause we when hard
I bag some niggaz I knew and some niggaz I didn't
I ain't a fuck either way it was no bullshiting
I'm a cruddy niggaz out to get money
And a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
Run up on a cat smooth like put it in his left ear
Give up the money the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking it's a game and play let's get popped
See how much fun you having when your heart be stopped
Shut 'em down open up shop oh-oh no-oh blow off a nigga top
Somebody call the cops but it's to late
'Cause I'm a hit you in the face
And what will kill you will be something that you ate

If pain is love why hide my pain with drugs
Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes and no soup to shave
And I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave
We used to get robbery vics
Until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then I switched to the weed and start selling crack
But I will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back
I feel like all my life I was held up in a trap
Like if I go to heaven maybe hell will want me back
But all I really want is sperwells up an a lap
And a model bitch sitting with a head in my lap
But since no doe don't spin
And my pant hole got hole within I got to fold ya men
It's obvious I live in a house of sin
I wish I could open up the door and let 'em blow at the wind

The Born Loser, not because I choose to be
But because all the bad shit happens to me
I got kids, but their mothers don't want them to know me
Sisters use to like me, but now they call me homie
Use to have a family now I'm out on my own
Had to scrap with the Pitt, 'cause I tried to take his bone
Bitches don't like me, they don't kiss me or hug me
They call me Kill-pretty, because I'm mad ugly
I use to get pussy, but I busted off quick
Now I gets none, so I gotta beat my dick
Time are hard in the ghetto, I steal for a living
Eatin turkey flavored Now or Laters for thanksgiving
If that ain't enough, life is rough, I swear
I don't have an address so I can't get welfare
They kicked me out the shelter
Because they said I smelled a little like the living dead
And look like helter skelter
My clothes are so funky, they bad for my health
Sometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by their self
Even when I was little nothin' went my way
I got beat up, and chased home from school every day
And despite the fact I won all the spelling bees
On my report card, I didn't get F's, I got C's
But for those who choose to snooze
Since I was born with no hope, I ain't got nothin' to lose...
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Check check check it out
The Born Loser, a title I was branded with
Went to Liberty Island, and got stranded with
The Statue of Liberty, but they really didn't hafta
Leave my black ass there till the day after
No time for laughter, this shit's for real
Ribs are showin through my back, 'cause I haven't had a meal
In about a week, you can see bones in my hands
The racoons, beat me to the garbage cans
I'm Starvin Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that
The only thing that I'm carvin, is an alley cat
But sometimes in the daytime
I daydream of a Manwich
When all I'm really eatin is an oxygen sandwich
For those that don't know,
That's 2 pieces of bread slapped together
Or I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather
Born loser, caught up in the game
And I ain't even got nobody to blame...

When I couldn't get a soul, to listen to my demo
Doors shut in my face, until I started jammin 'em
I'm behind the doors now, but I'm the one slammin' 'em
I did what I had to, to get where I got
Though I'll admit, what I had to do was a lot
I still gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot
Catchin vicks just to get a little loot
I thought it was cute, and didn't care who knew
Mess around get in my way and I'd bag you too
'Cause I was, born to lose, straight from the beginning
Hit the dugout, because I struck out the 1st inning
Winning, was everything, that's why I had to ask
My man to front me the loot, and he said I'd be glad to
Now, who needs a major label, we got our own
I'm the divine master of the unknown
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm the same as before
When opportunity knocks, I'd just answer the door

Check check check it out
The Born Loser, a title I was branded with
Went to Liberty Island, and got stranded with
The Statue of Liberty, but they really didn't hafta
Leave my black ass there till the day after
No time for laughter, this shit's for real
Ribs are showin through my back, 'cause I haven't had a meal
In about a week, you can see bones in my hands
The racoons, beat me to the garbage cans
I'm Starvin Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that
The only thing that I'm carvin, is an alley cat
But sometimes in the daytime
I daydream of a Manwich
When all I'm really eatin is an oxygen sandwich
For those that don't know,
That's 2 pieces of bread slapped together
Or I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather
Born loser, caught up in the game
And I ain't even got nobody to blame...
Young man went out and made a name for himself

The Born Loser, yeah, that use to be my m o
When I couldn't get a soul, to listen to my demo
Doors shut in my face, until I started jammin 'em
I'm behind the doors now, but I'm the one slammin' 'em
I did what I had to, to get where I got
Though I'll admit, what I had to do was a lot
I still gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot
Catchin vicks just to get a little loot
I thought it was cute, and didn't care who knew
Mess around get in my way and I'd bag you too
'Cause I was, born to lose, straight from the beginning
Hit the dugout, because I struck out the 1st inning
Winning, was everything, that's why I had to ask
My man to front me the loot, and he said I'd be glad to
Now, who needs a major label, we got our own
I'm the divine master of the unknown
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm the same as before
When opportunity knocks, I'd just answer the door
But criminal at heart, even though I don't show it
I was always a winner I just didn't know it (know it)

Metal slabs with yellow tags on toes it's
What happens to those that
Chose to be foes and
Bet his man knows
But yo, we only get stronger
And the amount of time we're facing is only gettin' longer
Get the mayor on the horn!

Strapped for the show down
Wet up yo crib, kick the door down
Know you schemin' so I gots to get you first
Put you right up in a brand new hearse
Could be worse
Shoulda seen what I gave this nigga
Two vests couldn't save this nigga
The way I laid this nigga
Played this nigga
But that's what I'm good at
Layin niggaz out in fightin' pits and fuckin' hoodrats
Where's my fuckin' hood at?
Cripple niggas like snitches
Rip on niggas like bitches
Then pour niggas in ditches
They ain't found half the bodies that a nigga caught
Or should I say a nigga bought
Cause ain't nothing like getting' paid for, a nigga sport
Triple what a nigga thought

Yeah baby, shit's about to jump off and
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north
Been like three years since when got knocked
Since he got caught
Punked up like five new blocks, holding down for it
Kept a nigga straight with money in the books
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks
Took him shopping, money in his pocket is straight
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate
Our estate was the next move for me
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months
'Cause when it's on, it's on
He didn't care
It's like slow down baby
The money ain't going nowhere
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it (come on)
You gotta watch a nigga just coming home in a game
Cause on the low we may just be trying to go against the grain
I never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled
What is strange is the change that niggaz go through
When they're locked down and really can't hack it
A motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket
Strap it on my back, niggaz ain't built like me
And by the end, niggaz was like ""Yo, why you killed Mike, D?""
Wasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him
Used to be my dog, so I let my cousin do him
Sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA
Cause the money comes quick
Half of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him (damn)
But things happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him (damn)
Got him up out of there and sent him down a little further
Ain't heard from him in two months, murder, murder
And from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something
This hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (come on)
Listen, money is missing and it's hectic (what?)
Found the safe, checked it
Shit looks detected (what?)
Just what I expected when I got no word from him
Asked around but ain't nobody heard from him (uh-huh)

Fuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue
It's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you
Takin' back for niggaz in New York and how they told me so
Now I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough
Layin' up with a hoe, then he hit me with the sob story (come on)
The famous ""Oh you didn't know I got robbed!"" story (come on)
Told it's to me he should be grateful to
Fuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do
Now there's love lost and a double cross
Pointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce

Hold up, I'ma show you why dog is the illest, kill this
You might not catch it, but you'll feel this
The realest nigga to ever do it
The realest nigga to ever go through it and y'all gon' bring me back to it
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Middle name is grime, came from crime
Thought I'ma change with time, niggas don't know me
But you can't hold somethin', you ain't got it, show me
This is a cold world, cold world, oh
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way
I said this is a cold world, cold world, oh
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way
The tunnel looks brighter from behind but you gotta keep movin', movin'
Because if life starts spinnin' in the right direction, who's losin', losin'
See in the night, I pray to keep me breathin', to see another day to give 'em something to believe in
'Cause I know it won't always be this way, when you're tryin' hard to make a change"

Places that I've have been, things that I have seen
What you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams
Bad as that may seem, I know is only going to get worse
Love, a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it begins
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end
Hold me down baby, it's gonna be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room, 'cause I guess enough died
Let me travel, cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Fuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like 'Oh, it's him again'
Niggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine

Me and DMX
I will spend mad time in one spot, plotting my next move
Trying to figure out what is it, that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered, that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of
They made love, or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, but they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog, was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the?
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl
Like the side of the dark, riding the park but wouldn't want to
When they jump me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it all was a joke, but I had the last laugh

I feel the ghost from within, coming back to haunt me
Stay love in my peoples, even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been getting love, but instead was plotting
Shit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special till this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the fo-fo, leave them dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs
That I bought to kill them
And that's because I thought I ought to kill them
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hating, when I can show love
What's the sense of faking, when I can show blood
Now what's the moral to this story?

Man, uh
Shit stay happen
Ya know
Its crazy dog
Its off the hook
But you know
Real niggas survive
No regardless
Them heartless
Who is this I see, comin' through, it's like 3
On the a.m., I'ma rob this nigga
An when I'm done, I'ma slay him
For bein' stupid like, comin' through after 1 or 2
And havin' a gun that he couldn't get to
Yeah, that one'll do
Foolish niggas learn the hard way, then I teach 'em
Be in the wrong place at the wrong time, then I leach 'em
Like Jigga said, niggas test you
When your gun goes warm
So I keep 'em scattering
Like roaches, when the light turns off
From night to dawn
Right from wrong
Hope no way
3-57 slugs with a snub nose, dray eight
Settin' all you bitches straight (what)
Squashin' all beefs
To the point where the police
Be blockin' all streets
Got me trapped up in the building
But you know how that go
I stay fucking with the hood rats
And I run up in the rab hole
Run through the hallway
See police, face to face
And bein' I'm tellin' you this story
Means I caught another case
Its either you or me
And more than likely, it's gonna be you, than me
Aiight? Feel me O
Day 2 of the saga
This fuckin' drama continues
Wakin' up like every 2 hours, lookin' out my window
Plus I keep the 4-4 pointed at the door
Just in case, when they bust in, I bust them
And I'm gunnin' for the face
""What a waste of potential"" is what my teachers used to tell me
""You can always get a job"" and cheap shit they tried to sell me
Got me no where but broke and fucked up in the game
But now I got a name, and niggas know my name
Knock of the door ""police, we lookin' for a man
Killed a couple of cops last night and the reward is ten grand""
I play like a bitch ""Its just me here, and I'm not dressed
And that guy sounds kinda dangerous, I hope you make an arrest""
That was a close one, now I know I gotta get outta the city
'Cause I know I'm hotter than lave, I'm holla the mouth
Got my dog on the horn, he like
""Fuck, you done did it
They a ran up in my crib, nigga, pattin down my kid"" (dial tone)
Put the harness on the dog, load up the weapons
Murder's on my mind, no half steppin'
Motherfuckers want war, you can get it,
'Cause I'm tired of runnin', remember me as the nigga that died gunnin'
Kamakaze mission, C-4 strapped to the chest
Run up in that joint, raw dog, fuck the vest
They can keep theirs, 'cause it won't be the slugs that'll kill 'em
It'll be the raw of the C-4 as I'm bringin' down the building
When I go, taking a bunch of the motherfuckers with me
I ain't sittin' around
Waiting for them faggot niggas to come and get me
I bring it to 'em, service with a smile
What nigga? Didn't know a dog with rabies was up in the cut, nigga?
Now that you finally findin' out what this shit means
I'm at the precinct, 116th
Run up in there
Open up my jacket ""You muthafuckers lookin' for me?
Well here I am now you comin' with me""
(Explosion)
Man, that shit is crazy baby
Can you dig it, can you dig it, can you feel it, is you wit it

Check my car, I don't care, I don't play fair
Keep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair
And it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear
I'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew
Small yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin' to you
You see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye?
I'm tryin' to leave my kids some real fuckin' change when I die
From rappin' or tellin' some cat to reach for the sky
I'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga
Bounty hunt your whole crew till my bullets go through, WHAT?
Yo, yo, yo, yo
All I need is a big gun and a Coupe that's crazy quick
A nice house with five rooms, maybe six
A town where money is coming, eighty bricks
Break 'em down to all twenties, is a crazy flip
Bet you never even felt the heat
Till I put the M1 next to your waves and melt the grease
Streets help niggaz; niggaz don't help the streets
Y'all use beats for help; we help the beats
Who want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P?
If I say so myself, it's a wonderful three
Be in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox
Same niggas that-a rob you love L.O.X. (uh)
All types of burners, even snub glocks (uh)
Nice size tecs you could carry in your sweats (uh)
Find your man dead in the trunk of a car (uh)
It's Jada {*mwwaa*} responsible for breakin your heart (uh)
Uh
Creep through the streets
For some of y'all rappers, that's mighty hard
Me the Security? Protectin my body? I let my shotty guard
Put chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol
Make niggaz drowsy from the blood loss, got 'em noddin off
And take casket naps, fuck that
You shoulda never let this bastard rap
All I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel
No parents, tale from my horror's no morals
Raised in the wrong era, with no guidance
So you dyin'? It's no problem, no lyin'
Drag's fire; so ya hamburger beef? I French-fry 'em
Drag done ate your food
Like I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up
Drag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up
Drag scorch niggaz for dinner but season 'em well
I don't brag I let the streets tell
Po'-po' now you see he fell
Uh, uh, now you motherfuckers
Know what my name means when you hear it in the streets (uh)
Y'all bitches fear it cause you weak
You wanna hear it? I make it speak (WHAT?)
You ain't ever bust a gun, but there's a lot of greasy talkin' (uh-huh)
What the science behind that son? (I don't know)
A lot of easy walkin'
I bust shit down (uh) got down (uh) kick down (uh) shot down (uh)
Ain't tryin' to talk about what I got now, but I got now (WHAT?)
I ain't never sold a brick, I done stuck niggaz up (c'mon)
And for talkin' too much shit? I done fucked niggaz up (uh)
It can get ""Dark"" for real, and I think you already know that (uh-huh)
Well think about it with the brick in your hand before you throw that
Now don't act, cause actin' might get you rollin'
With what you ain't ready to handle (UHH)
All that's left of your memory, is a candle (WOO!)
It happens quick fast nigga, to bitch ass niggaz
Talkin' reckless behind your back, them kiss ass niggaz (uh)
From the rap shit to the street shit, I keep shit tight
Let them cats spit that weak shit (What!)
I'm DOG FOR LIFE! NIGGA!

DMX is probably, one of the artists that saved Def Jam back in the day when Def Jam was going down
And-and he saved Def Jam with the, with the cruddy raps
But let me tell you how generous DMX was (Okay)
This is when I was producing
DMX flew me down to uh, L.A. (uh-huh) when he was shooting a movie
And uh, we did about four or five tracks
But the reason I knew DMX was so big
Is in the middle of the movie he stopped filming
And was like ""Envy, let's go, uh, fly helicopters."" (ha ha ha)
And we went to the store, we bought remote control helicopters
And started flying helicopters in the middle of the set!"

Do you - 'cause what it boils down to, it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley
Hey yo dog, I got lyrics
Hey yo dog, I got beats (word)
Damn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets?
Used to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody
Everywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party
It ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like
But if we all see it through the eyes of the lord, we see a light (c'mon)
Just let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something
Now the good things that go wrong because of a little frontin'
Express yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star
You don't even know what you got inside
How the fuck you gon' find out, you keep wanting to ride
Hey yo, I ain't gon' let it slide no more
You're best to go for what you know
Can't do you, then what you flow for
You ain't gon' get there tryin' to be me, dog
Look through your eyes, see what you see
Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley
Do you - 'cause what it boils down to, it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley
Like fuck it, you wanna be me? here's what you do
Grow up neglected by both parents and still pull through
You gots to come up fucked up, get treated like shit
Then have your mother's new boyfriend smack you like a bitch turn into a killer,
Don't carry shottie
'Cause the way it's goin' down right now, you gon' kill somebody
Get a dog, walk the streets, learn what you need to learn
Better have a cause but because you'll get burned
You got 15 years without ever coming out
And beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about
Then get locked up every two years
For two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears
Become a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes
Let 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine
In time, everything you hear will come true
But you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you
Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley
Do you - 'cause what it boils down to, it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley"
49,Dog Intro,2003,Grand Champ (2003),Hip Hop,DMX,"Yep yep yup, I don't really trust humans that much these days.
Shit, the fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans.
Shit, there's nothin' like that dog love I tell ya.
Not just any dog, it's gotta be a pit bull, yep, that's the only dog for me.
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them, boy.
They make good companions, but even worse enemies, it's all on how you take it.
Nothin' goes down I don't get a small piece of
Get the picture see the beauty in the beast of
The mad man, Mr. bad man is here
'Cause a nigga like me smells wreck in the air
Test they fear shit that I be doing to niggaz
Get away with the same shit ruining niggaz
Cover all ground and I roll thick like the fog
Only motha fuckin' friend I ever had was a dog
Never ate the hog but glad to say I smoked plenty of 'em
The fifth precinct to name one of many
In one verse I beat you worse than your momma
I fuck around and eat you first like 
I'ma, play that ass out like a bomber
Killed a nigga once for looking like he wanted drama
I'm buggin, the pain it hurts I gotta scream
Ah, lettin' off a little steam
Society was just too much, I couldn't hack it
Six motherfuckin' years in a straight jacket
Yo black it wasn't wise for them to let me out the joint
I never really got better, so I'm not on point
I just might flip, quick, but it's too late to be bitchin'
Got more loose screws than the table in your kitchen
I'm itchin', just hope you ain't around when I scratch
'Cause like I said before, I eats what I catch
Searchin' shit will have a nigga hurt and sick
The dirt you kick, will get you in the dirt and quick
World premier, you niggaz is kids, don't play
I'm too old for the jokes you'll get smoked, I don't play
I'm gon' say what's gon' happen if you force my hand
Someone somewhere will be like ""I lost my man""
Take it to heart it's about to get dark so run that
All that shit niggaz talkin' been there done that
What black think it's an act, let me know
But he liked what I'm sayin' so shut the fuck up and let me flow
Yo you think it's a game, keep playin'
They gon' find your ass somewhere in a creek layin'
It's over, you just ain't laid down yet
And in a minute you gon' be that motherfucka' that ain't found yet
Hold off from makin' movies and make moves
Stop talkin' about shit that you can't prove
I'm the mountain you can't move, so why you tryin'
Lookin' at me stupid wonderin' why you dyin'
While you flyin', through the air, with a big ass hole in your chest
Wishin' you was holdin' a vest
But it's too late for wishin', so you gettin' this rest
Go to sleep, Papa will take care of the stress
God bless and may He have mercy on your soul
Pop-pop, take these two more with you on your stroll, nigga
Yep yep yup, I don't really trust humans that much these days.
Shit, the fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans.
Shit, there's nothin' like that dog love I tell ya.
Not just any dog, it's gotta be a pit bull, yep, that's the only dog for me.
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them, boy.
They make good companions, but even worse enemies, it's all on how you take it.
You know how we do baby, aight, Grand Champ.
You know how we do, scratch all day, match our weight, fuck nigga.
You can't be fuckin' serious.

Started gettin' a little too big for the cage that I been trapped in
Cats new it was a problem, went from robbin to rappin'
Guns got the clappin, another trip to the morgue
We all know why it's happenin', another bit by the dog
When there's nothin' left to eat, I ate away at my soul
Felt destructive 'cause I don't give a fuck if I go
I know y'all been told I don't give a fuck about livin'
Killin' other dogs got you cats chasin bitches
Got me itchin to bring back the beast from within
What I catch I'ma eat, in the streets I'ma win
I've been top dog and I'ma stay top dog

Stop being greedy, when was the last time you gave to the needy
Believe me, I run through niggaz like hallways with the cops behind
Give it to a nigga all day 'cause I pops the nine
Man listen, if you don't wanna see your man missin', man listen
I get dough like a nigga in a up north flick
And still roll like a nigga on some up north shit

Please heh, for your sake, hehehe
Y'know? C'mon!"
56,Edge Of Da Night,1998,Unleashed & Unreleased (1998),Hip Hop,DMX,"The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from goin' under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gonna leave you in the desert, an I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your ends
Caps I fucked with are real, but hey
Those are your friends
Its just what you got comin' sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, did you ask for more?
Should the casket door swing here, it is done
An thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah it's getting' closer
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me an he won't let go
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'
Easy goin' up or down what have you been provin'?
Jus that you were fuckin' ground
Bitch seen the bullshit, but never spoke on it
An I know that deep down you really don't want it
I woulda traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when its harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night
Come on!
There's a lotta shit that I let slide, 'cause its outta my hands
Lotta niggas I let ride, but it's not in my plans
An a lot of my man's is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckload, fleein' them to the morgue
Full moon, arooooo, the howlin', grrrrrrr
An growlin', shhhhhh, an prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
Than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth is
What's gonna is what's gonna let niggas know
Why you bad in your house, an they lie up to your spouse
Told her it was suicide, but you an I
Both knew the truth, for we'd never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
'Cause you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there
This is hell an we both here
Can you feel it? Tell me yeah"
57,Fallin',2010,For The Love Of Money (2010),Hip Hop,DMX,"Father can you hear me when I'm callin' (callin', callin')
I need you to be near me when I' fallin' (fallin', fallin')
Stop me Lord, I'm going down the wrong road
And I'm moving fast for a person with a strong load
But the weight I bare, I can't wait to share
Scrapped it there, my faith was always there
I'ma make it yeah, life is what it is
Nobody said that you would make it fair
And I'ma take it there, built for war
Gladiator with a good heart but built for more
But sometimes ain't enough sunshine till you dark cloud
Cause the devil on line, cause there was one time
You put your hand on me and said
Don't worry about where you go, 'cause you're being led
Father can you hear me when I'm callin' (callin', callin')
I need you to be near me when I' fallin' (fallin', fallin')
Day gets hard, but it's supposed to
Call on God cause that's who I'm close to
Told him, I chose you
I was introduced to the Devil
And through it all, I still chose you
I needed you, you rose to the occasion
Stood beside me, no matter what I was facing
Here I go chasing the wrong thing again
But if I fall, I know it's you not him
That's be right there to pick me up
Put me back on my feet, ugh, lift me up
Plus you gave me the voice so I'm gon say it now
I love my God and I'm gon say it proud
Father can you hear me when I'm callin' (callin', callin')
I need you to be near me when I' fallin' (fallin', fallin')"

Uh...
Take it for what it's worth, my birth was a blessing
Sent to live and die, on earth as a lesson
We each have a star, all we have to do is find it
Once you do, everyone who sees it will be blinded (WHAT?)
They'll tell you that you're bright, and say you have a future
When you turn your back, same cats'll try to shoot ya
Niggaz ain't shit, I can live on both sides of the fence
Forget what you do, when you talk, see what you really meant (aight?)
That's what I thought, them niggaz was bluffin (uh)

Never got a plate on time but I grow (whoo)
Live your life, STAY on the line but I go (UHH)
Went from doin' crime to bein kind 'cause I know

Blessed with the curse (uh) niggaz don't hear me
Niggaz don't hear me, Y'ALL NIGGAZ, don't hear me (uh)
What'd I just say? ""Nigga g'head"" - you see that?
You gots to FEEL ME to catch what I'm sayin', BELIEVE THAT (UHH!)

Oh you kinda quiet with the heat at, your dome (UHH!)
If the dog got he's gonna bring back a bone
'Cause we got the chrome (C'MON!)
This is what I live for, or die for
I'm the nigga with the high score, you try for
What you niggaz wanna lie for? It changes nothin'

Dark Man baby, that's my name
And I gots to be the realest nigga (UHH) up in this game

I love music 'cause it's something special
I just have the words, when I'm done, I bet you
It will make you easier to cope with the pressure
Dark, cause you think the light won't let you
Right now all I see is shapes and sounds
You snake, you crown, that's why I shake it down
Got drop by one, I'ma take it now
It is what it is, you crying like ""I'ma make it now""
What the fuck off your knees, I don't swim like that
Put them, let it go, let it go, I throw that thing right back man
I can smell pussy from a mile away
Nigga your style... so put the smile away
Nigga acting like I'm the only one with problems
You know something about em, let's solve em
And at my words, you're not even half of it
And that's the reason why you'll always be
After me, faggot
Oh my god, no matter how hard I try
I can't get away from it
I got so much fire built up inside of me
But when it's time to let it go
I got one thing to give and one thing only
Yo dog
Hot bars is the only thing these motherfuckers getting
It's time to show these niggas dog ain't raised a fucking kitten
Eat 20 niggas like a twenty piece bucket of chicken
Ain't on my level, snowflake, who the fuck is you kidding?
Now how this chicken you came is what I am still
Fire hard enough to burn your whole entire grill
And believe me them 3rd degree burns are hard to heal
I have you wishing you listen to fire marshall bill
You can't take the fire that I'm bringing y'all
I'll have your ass begging for a fire extinguisher
And all your mens looking at you like damn holmes
I'm hot enough to burn the flesh off the dead bones
So for you niggas that be claiming that you got heat
And claiming that you the best and the next to eat
I'll be next to x on x degrees, with bars that will hit you
Like a bottle of Texas Pete
What?
Don't start what you can't deal with
'Cause I'm a nigga that still get thugged up baby, real shit
I'm a dog for real, I beast on niggas
Then get back to the streets on niggas, fest on niggas
Open a bottle of liquor, pop a can of beer
Pour the first sip but your homies, he ain't here
You burn you know and your heart be still right there
It is what it is, at times life ain't fair
You ain't me, so what I'm bout to do to this rapshit
Well have some real nigga talk excuse my back shit
Wish a nigga would, wish a nigga could
Regardless what you think a nigga still good
So easy to kill a nigga, especially when you don't feel a nigga
Can't see the real in a nigga,
You don't know about Gucci, you don't know about Prada
We won't be do know, if we gonna do what we gotta, nigga!"

Why them niggas always force you to take it back to the streets
Can I at least go one year without spitting the heat
Motherfuckers think you sweat till your chest gets messed up
Two days later he's dressed up, let him rest up
He ain't going nowhere, no time soon
Remember high noon, last thing he heard was BOOM
Can I gets some room, or do I have to make me a path
Break you in half, fake niggas make me laugh
Y'all niggas is funny, still talking about money
And ain't got none, get the shot gun cause you hungry

Doing it with the heat, and ain't killing nothing but time
Fucking with the streets you ain't feeling nothing but mine
Tired of hearing niggas rhyme and don't say shit
Fuck is on a niggas mind, why don't they quit
Sucking my dick, looking for something new
Let you man hold something, with your whole something crew
You know how niggas do, we don't forget shit
If you were there when it's thin, then you there when it's thick
No hitchhikers, fuck that, the ride was rough
And if you a nigga that was with us, then that was rough
A lot of niggas that is with us, ain't cried enough

But I got niggas like 'Yo, who's the next to drop'
From his camp get the stamp, the grand champ, it's official
Think when you die, how many's gonna miss you
Lean over in your casket and kiss you
Send you on your way with a blessing
And pray that another learned a lesson
Smith and Wesson ended moneys life, now moneys wife's a widow
'Gave it to him full blast', nah dog just a little
Besides rap, I don't talk, but make plenty of moves
I'll murder ten of you fools, before your ready to choose
You either win or you lose, and I 'luh' to win
Even if it means I got to shed blood again
Keep a bank account doubling but don't hate me
Really thought that's what you said, would either make me or break me
No, and it don't take me long to write
Matter of fact I think I'll drop another song tonight

Though I have a death wish it ain't been granted yet
So until then I'm gonna be that nigga all up in your chest (come on!)
Until the lord decides to lay my ass down to rest
Bless my body at the funeral and hope I don't burn
Was a hard headed nigga and nope I don't learn
Saw the truth but chose to ignore it wasn't goin' for it
My nigga had to give it to me (Ah!) then I saw it
This is clear as day I know here's the day
I'm gonna be on my way nothin' more to say
But take me lord make me lord what you will
Really wanted to chill but learned how to kill

Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
What's on y'all niggaz minds fuckin' wit' me, y'all know somebody has
Told you about fuckin' wit' D, stuck in a tree is what you will be, like a cat
And I'm the dog at the bottom, lookin' up what's that.
Your worst nightmare is I take it right there, you got niggaz comin' where they at, right where? I make 'em like air, floatin' away, wouldn't tell what he was thinkin' so I opened a way, Went from broken away, you know he hurt before he died, makes you wonder if he lost his shirt before he died, only two knew the answer and one of us is dead, so anyone who seeks the truth can get it straight to head!
Than you andf him can discuss what I did, yeah it was wrong dog but I slid, I'll repent one day, just not right now, you hear my shit all on the street I'm kinda hot right now!
Come on!
I don't give a fuck about chy'all niggaz cause y'all ain't killin' nuttin'!
I don't give a fuck about chy'all niggaz cause y'all ain't killin' nuttin'!
I wanna break bread wit' da' katz that I starve with, wanna hit the malls with the same dogz I rob wit', wanna be able to laugh with the niggaz that I cried with, when it's over be like these is tha niggaz that I died wit'.
What do you do when you find out in the hall there's a rat, what do you do when
You find out that your dog is a cat, Shit, on niggaz back, can't hold but two
So while you gettin' more gatz I'm puttin' wholes in you, snubnose will do, break 'em off real proppa', need to keep it' spittin' but I ain't gonna stoppa', cocka, unlocka, let 'em go, give it to his man just to let him know, All things considered it was real for' a minute, got what was yourz and tried to steal sometin' wit it, now feel sometin' hit it, your chest that is, the best that is, is probably the best that slid, yo stress that kid!
I don't give a fuck about chy'all niggaz cause y'all ain't killin' nuttin'!
I don't give a fuck about chy'all niggaz cause y'all ain't killin' nuttin'!
When Niggaz hear that dog bark, they betta run, when police hear that dog bark they betta come, they expect tha same thing that's live, and they lives will be lost, there is a price to pay, how many lives will be lost, COME ON!
Since I run with the devil I'm one with the devil, I stay doin' dirt so I'm gonna come with the shovel, Hit chyou on a level of a madman who's mind's twisted, Made niggaz dreams caught the last train, mines missed it, Listed as a manic depressin' with extreme paranoya! and dog I got sometin' for ya! hear my name, feel my pain,
Niggaz wanna steal my fame, but first feel my reign, know what it's like to suffer, never have enough of shit, startin' off hard than only gettin' rougher! tougher, but than came the greese, so if you wanna say peace, tame the beast!..."

But as far as rap goes, you a motherfucking fool
If you don't want chips, you should have stayed in school
You and 8-ball nigga, you wanna play pool
I'll put you in the side pocket, look at the size of my rocket
Styles don't lie, cop the work then clock it
Boxes full of boots, jeans, suits and watches
Niggaz don't pump if they can't make a profit
Stop it, before we pull it back then cop it
Vacant lot niggaz come through then we
Yeah, what? what? what?"

Drag-On, niggas act on
Messin with the team, its gon be a sad song
X will bring the day and the night
'Cause we get it right, hit it right, get it right, spit it right
Moves is made, niggas is paid, that's just how it is
When my time is up I'ma be out but I'ma try to live
I'm eatin day by day, ain't nothin' sweet about it
Act like you don't know what I'm sayin' then you read about it
Built for war like a armadillo
Smother yo' ass with too good a pilllow
Hear my shit is brillo
Manic depressive and my head hurts
Since there's a dead thirst I'll wet first
Now wait a minute it gets worse
I can't control what I own inside
So I take it out on the soul of that kid that died
Spit fire, cross niggas like barbecues
Mobbin crews, strippin niggas, robbin crews
And put him speechless, when I made him eat this
Hollow tip and you can follow grip
You be like Kim and ain't gon swallow shit
Don't know the half, couldn't know the math
To understand the wrath of a man split in half
But he got what he wanted, shot for three hundred
Shit is tight and a nigga that's right gots to run it
Ain't no question, that's how I get down
Niggas know gimme yo' dough and yo' hoe, and here take these fo'
Hot things I got things that make niggas spin
Put niggas in the wind, where you never see niggas again
Bless a nigga with fifties the thin types
And a straight blast that'll put pinstripes across your windpipe
Drag-On, niggas act on
Messin with the team, its gon be a sad song
X will bring the day and the night
'Cause we get it right, hit it right, get it right, spit it right
Drag-On, niggas act on
Messin with the team, its gon be a sad song
X will bring the day and the night
'Cause we get it right, hit it right, get it right, spit it right
Drag opposite water more than a spot order
My flows cause fire then bring holes
Takes more than a pump to out this little punk
'Less that pump is a twelve, and I get popped, still I burn to hell
Call the police and whatever they don't seize
And put in they mouth, and catch freeze, tell 'em throw Drag some keys
Don't care how many oyeas I gotta make believe
If you nervous, you don't deserve it poppi please
Cats stealin gats y'all probably will get hit
Well I'm the future let's see y'all copy this, stopping this
Since a tiny kid like, ""mommy buy me this""
Since she always told me no, started stealin on some grimy shit
Like look at that, now look at that slide it in my bookbag
I'm who, parents point they fingers at, ""get from that hoodrat""
And put it back, fuck tough, while y'all cook crack
I'm cocaine, throw me in the pot, I rise to the top
With your 5.0, go 'head, look ma, I got four more pegs
Stil put them holes in yo' head, till it's mushy like dough bread
'Cause that vest only protects that chest
And if I decide to get ice, don't get to fascinated
Or it's my bullet, your brain, mashed potatoes
Double R got me comin' hard on you haters
'Cause we the streets black and y'all belong beneath that
Drag-On, niggas act on
Messin with the team, its gon be a sad song
X will bring the day and the night
'Cause we get it right, hit it right, get it right, spit it right

It's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good!

Short ones tall ones big ones small ones
Winter spring summer and fall yo I love 'em all
Especially the cuties with the smooth complexions and shapely booties
With the type of bodies that'll make you say ""Oh boy.""
Yup but baby if you're ugly I ain't got nothing for ya.
I'm not conceited, I'm convinced that I've been naturally blessed
To (?) and irresistible with (?)
And what's that get that breaks down (?) a cutie I bag 'em
The instant I see a cutie with a bootie wiggle it just like jello
To me being a player approach and say hello but she didn't hear me
So I tapped her softly, She turned around screaming on me ""Back up off me!""
I said ""Damn, there is no need for hostility, I'm a mellow type of fellow""
Instil the tranquillity, She said ""I recognize all of y'all are the same only after one thing
And kinda swift with the game"" I said ""Come on now sweetheart do I look like a player?""
She said ""Of course not, psych."" (?) let me know the deal I wanna ask you
""Are you for real, are you really for real is this love that I can't believe the way you make me feel,
Are you for real?"" As real as it gets my name is not James Brown but I believe you in a cold sweat
And I bet there's no if, ands, and maybes when I'm finished I will have you sayin' ""Do me baby.""

She said her name was Crystal and she kept the pistol on her and if I ever cheated
Believe I be a goner, so I played the perfect gentleman ever time I was wit' her
And when I wasn't wit her I was going to get her when I wasn't going to get her she was coming to get me
Then when she wasn't coming to get me she was wit me
So for a while everything was smooth, I waited and contemplated my next move
My instinct had told that the time was right for us to get together
For a magical night so I called her, she said ""Hello"" I said ""Hey""
She said ""Wait, I already know what you have to say,"" she said ""Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place because I'm not too sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace, Oh I don't know
The way that I feel I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I--"" Hold up sweetheart, just chill, relax your telling me the answer
And I didn't even ask don't you think that we should be alone this is not the type of thing to
Talk about over the phone, why don't you ""Come on and go with me,
Come on over to my place."" Where we can sit down and talk about it face to face
Why don't you ""Come on and go with me,
Come on over to my place""
Where we can discuss the (?) of picking up the pace She said
""I thought about it and I think that your right but, my parents are home so
It won't be tonight but, um why don't you come over tomorrow at 8 my parents leave at 7:30 and won't be back until late.""
I said ""Then let me go and get set tomorrow will be a day that you will not forget""
So the next day around 7:54 I picked up like 6 condoms and headed for the door stepped outside
I was asked where was I going by detectives with nine millimetres that were showing
I said ""To my girls house."" They said ""No you aren't,"" I said ""Why not?""
They said because they have a warrant
I said ""That's impossible how can that be?"" They said ""It's right here,
Robbery, first degree."" Well anyway to make a long story short I ended up in (?)
Going to court so I call Crystal the night around 8 I said ""It's just a mix up""
And blamed it on fate she told me that she loved me and promised to wait she said ""I'll see you in court
On your next court date."" Despite being locked up things weren't bad
I still had my girl and for that I was glad
She always came to visit didn't mind the (?) and every night I wrote a letter telling her things like
I can't feel myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love (?)
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my lips 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my daydreaming learning how to say ""I love you""
You must've known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
Oh mama!
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
And I just don't wanna stop
Days turned into weeks, weeks into months
10 days to 25th and I've only gotten mail once
What had happened to my love life
Why do I feel like I've been stabbed in the back with a knife
I tried to believe I said she loves me, she does but deep down
I knew what the scoop really was you see
Jody had my girl and now she was gone
Just thinking about it had me singing every love song
I'm thinking to my self how could she do me wrong but it's not her fault
I was away for too long I thought I had a girlfriend but now I know better
She told me that she wrote me but I never got the letter
Every time I tried to call her nobody was home
And since I had to call collect she put a block on the phone
She told me she would visit but damn I haven't seen her
You wanna know why because Jody is in between her legs and getting busy
He even ate the coochie, yo I bought her everything from Fendi to Gucci
But (?) in something that I didn't even have to sweat her
And if it doesn't happen by now it's gonna get her um
""Thrown up in the middle I don't know what to do
What do you do when your girl is untrue
There's another man, another man
In my life, in my life.
Oh, another man is beating my time
Another man is loving mine
Oh, another man is beating my time
Another man is loving mine
Beating my time
Another man was loving mine
I was upset but there were other things on my mind
I would start trial soon and was facing a lot of time
And on the day of trial I was nervous for a while but when they said not guilty
I stepped with a smile back to freedom, freedom on the streets again
Where I had to go and see what was up with my friend
So I called her just to make sure she was home I said ""Hello,""
And a man's voice answered the phone I was confused at first I didn't know what to do
Said who is this he said ""It's Jody and what is it to you?""
I turned up the receiver, picked up my gun, and straight for Crystal's crib
I started running murder, murder my fingers on the trigger murder, murder
I'ma murder this nigga. So then I thought why should I do him? He wouldn't have no pussy if she didn't give it to him
I thought about killing him thought about it twice said ""Nah.""
Why because it wouldn't be nice and for the sake of curiosity I had to go see Crystal
And ask her why did it have to be me? I knocked on the door and just like before
I heard a man's voice saying he couldn't take it any more the door opened up
But Jody (?) he looked me up and down and said I guess (?)
Now here comes Crystal yelling and fussing, hollering screaming, shouting and cussing
She looked at me and (?) got quiet in the hall she (?) and why didn't you call
I turned around to leave and she said ""Please don't go,"" I said ""You used to be my girl
Now you're nothing but a hoe I understand 'cause I'm a man but there's no (?) in stake
""So I spread my wings and fly away, yeah""
You know what I'm sayin'?

Got that? Didn't Get? You know where you gonna be layin right?
I'm tellin' you, hah, you know what the fuck I'm sayin' right?
You will respect this, 'cause it gets reckless when I cut the
Dun-nun-Dun-nun-Dun-nun-Dun-nun, you be like ""What the--No!""
But it's too late 'cause the heat-seaker done found the heat
The concrete done found your meat
'Cause hittin the ground still hot from steam comin' off
Eyes rolled back in his head, coughin up chunks of flesh
Then niggaz'll roll with his monstrous death, beatin' punks to death
Ain't nothin' left but the memory of what used to be your life
Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife
Y'all motherfuckers don't understand, when it's on it's on
You up in the casket with some shades, 'cause your eyes is gone
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid
But you made it happen, with that bullshit you did
Now you want peace? Well take a piece of this ammunition
And get your ass drug out the Hudson by some old man fishin
My mission is almost complete
This message will self distruct in two seconds
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeep"
89,Grand Finale,2010,The Best Of DMX (2010),Hip Hop,DMX,"I ain't goin' back to jail
Next time, the County or the State see me
It's gonna be in a bag
UHH! This is it baby!
End of the road, ha hah!
When you a dawg, you a dawg for life!
You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though
You don't hear me though, c'mon, c'mon!
Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe
From the Friday the 13th, ghetto Jason
Itchy trigger finger achin, snatch yo' ass
Out that S-Class for fakin, forty-fo' blast
Is a bloodbath, take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here
Kids know the half you get plugged here, that's just impossible
For the weak to last now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin you, watchin me
Throwin' rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young G we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
'Cause we family for better or worse, you and I
From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
To be here, and each year, I'm pourin out more beer
For deceased peers, holdin' fort
Police line 'Do Not Cross', they found his corpse
In the loft with the head cut off, and butt naked
Homicide the crime Method, add another
Killer verse to the murder record, the Grand Finale
Who wan' test me, c'mon!
Me shot pussy-hole fi fun
Hot corners, cops with warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, getting bent, lick a poem
My dawg, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
In the stomach, he robbin niggaz who pumpin
Lil' Blood got popped, by the Group Home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats
Fiend yellin' out, who got those? Go and see
Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin' from court cases
Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down 'cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The Mayor wanna call the SWAT team to come and kill us
But, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
To get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's
And only five in, the Belly of the beast
Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggaz from the hood, hangin' off his teeth
We slangin to eat, bringin' the heat
Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh
When you a dawg you a dawg for life (ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love (see eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (let us fly)
Come on niggaz! (we dawgs for life)
When you a dawg you a dawg for life (ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love (see eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (let us fly)
Come on niggaz! (we dawgs for life)
There's mad money out here dawg
Mad money out here
What you tryin' to get it? (Word up)
You gonna bust your gun to get it? (Tsh, whatever yo)
I hear you I hear you
Uh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, 'cause I KNOW it's a dream
Niggaz that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob em
Niggaz that know me well see me and think I'ma problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God I turn your last name to Underwood
'Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on? That's D
The dawg come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how MUCH YOU NEED?
Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED
How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin' up out that ass you feelin', gettin' realer
Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
One more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over! This is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall
When you a dawg you a dawg for life (ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love (see eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (let us fly)

91,Have You Eva,2012,Undisputed (2012),Hip Hop,DMX,"Have you ever? Oh!
Have you ever got up smiling, laid down crying 
First you love life then wish you were dying 
Bitch so fed up gave up trying 
Kept it straight up but niggas kept lying 
Ever seen something that you wanted so bad 
And got it then wished it was something you never had 
You ever been so lost than you thought you won't make it 
If you ever been forced to do something you couldn't take it 
You ever felt so strong or so loved 
But when it came down it wasn't meant to be so hard 
Wake yourself up like, where did I go wrong! ? 
Just get back up, pray on it and go on 
Have you eva been up, ever been down 
Ever been lost, then came around 
Ever been through it then came outta there 
Never had it, then got a lot of it 
Have you eva been up, ever been down 
Ever been lost, then came around 
Ever been through it then came outta there 
Never had it, then got a lot of it 
Ever wanted to go right, then shows left 
He down with a lift to way shows death 
Burn in the night but everyday shows stress 
Regardless of what you think I'm going in that 
Have you ever wished upon a star that really wasn't there 
Gaze so in your heart, but really didn't care 
Stand out at the wrong turn and now life ain't fair 
And all you can do is take it, like ye 
Ever found out that the shit you was living with 
Deeper, 'cause to me is tryin' to creep ya 
Back your glock off put your ass in a sleeper 
Used to be my dog, now he's the Grim Reaper 
Have you eva been up, ever been down 
Ever been lost, then came around 
Ever been through it then came outta there 
Never had it, then got a lot of it 
Have you eva been up, ever been down 
Ever been lost, then came around 
Ever been through it then came outta there 
Never had it, then got a lot of it 
Ever seen something that you didn't want to see 
Had to be something that you didn't want to be 
Had to kill a nigga that looked just like me 
Wanted to believe to have a trust like me 
I seen the dark, I seen the light 
I seen the day, I seen the night 
I seen the wrong, I seen the right 
I seen the start, I seen the final

Keep (
) your head (

When I think I don't deserve it, I think about Jesus
And the fact that he was perfect and he thinks that I'm worth it
I know I got a purpose, so when I don't like what I see in the mirror
I learn to look past the surface
Believe me God heard this, 'cause these words came from my heart
I was in pain, it was dark
Then came the spark to light down the road
To let me know, that he would lighten up my load
And it's gon' get greater, later
God only wants the best for me, but the devil's a hater
I can see his eyes through the smiles of fake friends
If y'all think hate wins just keep waitin'
At the end of the day who's will will you think will prevail
Or will you live to tell
Miracle after miracle it comes through
The spiritual individual is in you
Keep (
) your head (

Keep (

Lord if you hear me, you know that I'm comin' to you sincerely
I need you near me, please feel me
I'm sick and I need for you to heal me
I'm lost and lookin' for the real me, I'm tired and weary
Haven't been able to see things clearly
And even though I know you love me dearly, I still get leery
So where does that leave me, lost and alone
I wanna call God but it's like, I lost my phone
Every day is a struggle 'cause I juggle my problems
Need to let go and let God, 'cause only he could solve 'em
I'm tired of lyin' to myself, thinkin' I could do it on my own
But when I get left alone
That's when the devil sneaks in and creeps in
Knocks on the door lightly then peeks in
And it's usually around the weekends
That I get reckless and jump off the deep end, come on
Keep (
) your head (
) to the sky (

Keep (

Whoever make it out meet back at the new house good luck

You cover the first two and I'll take the sack

Bump into my man, I remember from up North
I remember he had principles and wasn't nothin' soft
Off with disgust just was slow and dizzy
Everybody got it aight let's get busy
Run up in the bank bitch (woman screams) hit the deck
Yo bust money, and get the keys off his neck (come here)
We on the clock, three mintues until we finished
Feds are on the way, but I'm tryin' to see spinach
In and out duffle bag across the back
Extra large sports coat to cover up the mack

And if he don't, I'ma hit his wife with his half
But that's the type of nigga I am this ain't just rappin'
I made it, he didn't but ain't shit happens
What can I do, but go on livin'
Fleein' from the condo, I go on a ribbon
Life goes on, that might sound wrong but heey
We all live by the rules of the game we play
Day to day, death is a possibility
The way I play is a fist stops you from killin' me
It's too hot to be in the heat 'cause it's on
Too hot to be in the streets so I'm gone
Go back to being discreet live long

96,Here We Go Again,2010,The Best Of DMX (2010),Hip Hop,DMX,"Same old shit dog, just a different day
You know how niggas do when we play how we play
It is not a fucking game!
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
If it's fuck me nigga, then you know it's fuck you
I kick it to shorty to try to help him understand (uuh)
Hit him with work cause yo, that's my little man (uh-uh)
He asked a few questions 'bout the game and I told him
And when he made a bad move it was my place to scold him (aight)
Never told nutting wrong, I kept it fair
He didn't listen, so I might as well have been talking to the air (damn)
Everybody makes mistakes, and mistakes is aight
But if it ain't, Ima tell you straight time to say goodnight
Nobody likes to be played, regardless of the relationship
But shorty's fucking up big time, I HATE THIS SHIT
I'm caught in the middle of having love for a lil' nigga
Knowing what's expected of me as a real nigga (damn)
My next move is crucial, wat do I do?
How do I keep real to my shorty and my crew?
Didn't want to kill him, so instead of putting the Mac on him
I did the only thing I could do, turn my back on him
Chorus:DMX
Here we go again
Same old shit dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do, what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me nigga, then you now it's fuck you
Niggas that I fuck wit, wanna get him dead
But I'm cool with shorty's peoples, so I let him live
Under normal circumstances, he would be a marked man
But I hit him with a grand, just didn't shake his hand (ooh)
Go about your business (uh-uuh) do what you gonna do (uh)
Be what you gon' be, I wash my hands, I'm through (aight?)
I can forgive you, I just can't forget
You're on your own lil' man don't ask me for shit (no)
If you paid attention to what I taught you then you good (uuh)
If I see you again, GET IT, understood?
Go ahead before I change my mind 'cause you know you should be dead
""I just wanted to say---"" Aight!GO 'HEAD!
Instinct told me to kill him but the saviour is
I'm a good nigga, plus I owed his peeps a favor (hmm)
But I also knew, the decision I just made (yeah)
Went against the rules of the game that we played (damn)
Here we go again
Same old shit dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do, what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me nigga, then you now it's fuck you
I should have followed my 1st instinct 'cause I knew
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do
Now this niggas fucking wit the competition (WHAT?)
Ungrateful motherfucker, shoulda got him missing (WHAT?)
This nigga got the nerve to take my kindness, for a weakness
Gotsa get back on some street shit so I can creep this
Rat, When I act,
Take one, set I'm up,
To take two, get him there,
Take three, get him done
Wasn't hard for me to get him where I wanted him, confronted him
{*Barrel spins*} BZZZZZZT, CLICK! There was a bullet in one of them
Feeling lucky? CLICK! Looks like you are
CLICK!CLICK!CLICK, luck ain't goin' too far
What you did was put a another pair of shoes
And they happened to be too big
What you did was stupid (damn) real fucking stupid (aight)
Well shorty I gave you a chance and what did you do?
Threw it back in my fucking face, so FUCK YOU TOO! *BLAM* aight
Here we go again
Same old shit dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do, what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me nigga, then you now it's fuck you
Here we go again
Same old shit dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do, what a man's gotta do
Here we go again

Sometimes, sometimes you just know, you just know, that's all
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waitin for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord, oh Lord
The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from goin' under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gonna leave you in the desert, an I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your ends
Caps I fucked with are real, but hey
Those are your friends
Its just what you got comin' sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, did you ask for more?
Should the casket door swing here, it is done
An thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah it's getting' closer
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waitin for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord, oh Lord
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me an he won't let go
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'
Easy goin' up or down what have you been provin'?
Jus that you were fuckin' ground
Bitch seen the bullshit, but never spoke on it
An I know that deep down you really don't want it
I woulda traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when its harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night
Come on!
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waitin for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord, oh Lord
There's a lotta shit that I let slide, 'cause its outta my hands
Lotta niggas I let ride, but it's not in my plans
An a lot of my man's is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckloads, fleein' to the morgue
Full moon, arooooo, the howlin', errrrrrr
The growlin', shhhhhh, the prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
Than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth is
What's gonna is what's gonna let niggas know
Why you died in your house, why they lied to your spouse
Told her it was suicide, but you an I
Both know the truth will never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
'Cause you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there
This is hell an we both here
Can you feel it? Tell me yeah
I remember, I remember don't worry, how could I ever forget, it's the first time the last time, we ever met, but I know the reason why you keep your silence up, no you don't fool me the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows it's no stranger to you or me

I wish that everything that happens in the dark, comes to the light.
I wish upon the days, wish upon the dream.
I wish that everybody only said, what they mean.
I wish I could have caught you, before you fell.
I wish nobody had to go to hell.
I wish Adam wouldn't have listened to Eve, when he bit the apple.
I wish the Ku Klux Klan didn't own Snapple.
I wish that nobody had to ever know the pain, that comes with the mental rain.
I wish that no parent ever have to bury a child.
I wish you wouldn't hurry to get wild.
I wish for so many things, in so little time.
I wish all this wishes weren't mine.

I'm wishin' there was no hunger or starvation.
That God'll take back the nation from Lord's satin
I wish I never popped pills, that I robbed from my grandpap, dyin' in a hospital.
I wish I didn't lust more, I wish I could trust the Lord for a month or more.
I wish I could physically touch or see Jesus in the flesh leavin' nothin' left to stress
I'm wishin' we were focused on the hopeless, broke n', strugglin' mothers who are dope sick
I'm wishin' New Orleans hadn't looked like an over flooded pool, with no chlorine
I'm wishin' Bill Clinton would return and I don't care, let him get his nuts sucked through the whole term
I wish I wasn't so selfish, I wish I ain't chase this cake, like I don't know what wealth is
I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you.
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen.
I wish I could be real, I wish I could meet you.
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen.
And the hours, and the minutes, and the seconds
Are just as important, take, nothin' for granted
And try to hold on, to LOVE, cause now I,
I wish I could touch you, I wish I could see you.
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen.
I wish I could be real, I wish I could meet you.
I wish you could talk to me, cause now I wanna listen.

Told y'all niggaz

Why must you be hard headed
Tried to explain, but ya didn't hear me though
Ya know, grrrrrr
Uh
One two one two, come through run through
Gun who, oh you don't know what the gun do
Some do, those that know are real quiet
Let me think you wanna try it, fuck around and start a riot
Niggas gonna buy it, regardless because I'm the hardest rap artist and I'ma start this
Shit up foreal, get up and feel, my words
I make herbs split up and squeal
Ill is all I've been hearin lately
Niggaz hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late for that 911 call
Niggaz stay beefin but a lot of them bluffin
But not me because I'ma nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them tough
Not just for frotin
When I hit them niggaz like 'What you want?' the battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggaz chasin 'em down
We all knew that you was pussy but I'm tastin it now
And never give a dog blood because raw blood
I have a dog like one bitin whatever
All up in ya gut
Give it to them raw like that and ain't no love I do 'em all like that
Four right up in they back
Clak Clak
Close your eyes baby, it's over
Forget it, happened in front off your buildin but nobody knows who did it
What

Keep me runnin' from the werewolf, owww
Howling at the moon on the roof
Eh, ah, no, get em
Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have 'em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Trieed to strike back
Left him like that, layin up with the white hat
Gettin' right back at ya when I snatch ya up out the grave, nothin' but bones and ashes
Hittin niggaz with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red
But this girl gave me head for free
'Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003
That Nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He went through like 20 G's and thought that
I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinkin' and eventually found that's what you get for stinkin
Blowin' up the spot when you rot plus if it gets hot they know you dipped
For four squared blocks
Hit 'em with the ox to the grill
Eh, ah, kill nigga kill
Yet still they don't know I'ma rob who
That dog DMX is a muthafuckin problem

Then tell, your mother, next time she see her son is never
And I be on yo' dick, if my name was ""No Pussy"".. ever
Like ""The Hulk,"" but they can't fix me
""Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom,"" and sly like Bill Bixby
This should be havin' niggaz in the emergency
Undergoing surgery, wanting to murder me
When you go, you know you heard of me
And yo' last thought is what you did wasn't worth ya life
It's what yo' ass bought
Caught up in some shit, and I had to let you feel this steel
They found his faggot ass slumped over the steering wheel
You still feeling real? Naw nigga you looking tired
Gone on to sleep baby, 'cause yo' shit is just expired

Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy Name, thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
*For the Bible tells me so*
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses,
*Jesus loves me, Yes I know*
As we forgive those who trespass against us.
*Jesus loves me*
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
*Jesus loves me*
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,
For ever and ever. Amen.
Jesus loves me, he told me so. That's why when it gets ugly
He hugs me, 'cause he knows me, yo.
Ya gotta let go and let God, sometimes from the get go ya go hard
It's like, the darker it gets, the brighter my light will shine
So regardless I'm lovin' this life of mine
And with the Lord by my side, it don't matter what the call of life
Cause let me in, 'cause I was going for the ride
Ain't blind, ain't gotta sin to believe it
I just know you gave me the word and that I really need it
So I pray for my enemies, I pray for family, my friends, my loved ones and those who pretend to be
Sacrifice your son just to give me a chance
So I thank you for the plan, I thank you for your hand
Shepherd, watching over your flock of sheep
But I'm good, cause you watchin' the dark when I sleep
Jesus loves me, yes I know
For the Bible tells me so (and I believe it in my soul)
Jesus loves me, yes I know (Oh yeah)
For the Bible tells me so (and I believe it in my soul)
Speaking of the word, it's sad that not all get it
But by the grace of God, I was born with it, come on get it
Jesus loved me from the beginning, that's why sometimes
Even though it looks like I'm losing, I'm still winning
But I ain't never been blind, never gonna sign,
Never been one to let the Devil know what's on my mind
'Cause he wants to destroy ya, but the Lord will resurrect ya
If ya hug the little boy, then the man will protect ya
From the dark to the light, right to the wrong
I'm gonna stay up in this fight, from the night till the morn
Well as I'm in the grace of God, my heart will stay true
And I'm gonna do whatever the heart will say do with it
When things go wrong, Jesus loves me
I'm singing this song because Jesus loves me
I'm gonna be strong cause Jesus loves me
Jesus loves me, yes, Jesus loves me
Jesus loves me, yes I know
For the Bible tells me so (and I believe it in my soul)
Jesus loves me, yes I know (Oh yeah)
For the Bible tells me so (and I believe it in my soul)
Now clap your hands with me (uh huh, uh huh)
And stomp your feet with me (come on, come on)
And bob your head with me (uh huh, uh huh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Not because my momma told me (NO)
Not because my daddy told me (NO)
Not because my preacher showed me (NO)
Gotta feel it in my soul!
Not because my homeys told me (NO)
Not because my teacher taught me (NO)

125,Let Me Fly,1998,It's Dark And Hell Is Hot (1998),Hip Hop,DMX,"Uh. Yeah. Uh. If you love something let it go, if it
Comes back to you it's yours. If it doesn't, it never was.
Hold me down baby
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Hold me down, niggaz wanna know me now
Didn't want ta play wit' me when to show me how
No meow
Is it all about the bark?
Let the dog lose baby it's about to spark
Light up the night, like the 4th of July
Niggaz know, when I let go, niggaz die
Wit' this Y and you don't know you slow like Baltimore
If you ain't tryin' ta go ya blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go it's violence cause the wildest
Leaves the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat
In the fog but y'all niggaz see is the bat
Flappin' away wit' 'em blind like Stevy
Niggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me
Stop being greedy, ya heard what I said
Let me go, let me flow on my bed
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
I sold my soul to the devil, and the price was cheap
A yo it's cold on this level 'cause it's twice as deep
But you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on
Sometimes it's better to be thought dumb
Shall I go on
You don't want no real, what the deal is a mystery
How is it I can live and make history
If you don't see it then it, wasn't meant for you to see
If you wasn't born wit' it then, it wasn't meant for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be hound
Lock down in a cell wit' a soul gettin' dwelled
This is hell, go get the devil and get me the key
But can't be worst than the curse that was given ta me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone
There's a difference between, doin' wrong and being wrong
And that ain't right
Just keep it fair baby
Put me in the year, and I'll take it there baby
Yes
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
I'm a flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me death but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road, where you were told
That you would go, when you were old
And if you died young, it was told
So what the dilly, what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like what of his birth
What if it was a miscarriage and I never existed
Have I given something that have been taken away you
Would of missed it
Didn't know, did I persisted?
It was the call of the wild
I'm here to say what's in my heart, and you call it a style
Don't put it in the cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge, here it is eat it
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing I got it locked wit' this rap shit
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Or give me death, uh uh uh, or take my breath
I'ma die anyway, but I'll be gone any day

126,Let Me Fly,2010,For The Love Of Money (2010),Hip Hop,DMX,"Uh. Yeah. Uh. If you love something let it go, if it
Comes back to you it's yours. If it doesn't, it never was.
Hold me down baby
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Hold me down, niggaz wanna know me now
Didn't want ta play wit' me when to show me how
No meow
Is it all about the bark?
Let the dog lose baby it's about to spark
Light up the night, like the 4th of July
Niggaz know, when I let go, niggaz die
Wit' this Y and you don't know you slow like Baltimore
If you ain't tryin' ta go ya blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go it's violence cause the wildest
Leaves the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat
In the fog but y'all niggaz see is the bat
Flappin' away wit' 'em blind like Stevy
Niggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me
Stop being greedy, ya heard what I said
Let me go, let me flow on my bed
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
I sold my soul to the devil, and the price was cheap
A yo it's cold on this level 'cause it's twice as deep
But you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on
Sometimes it's better to be thought dumb
Shall I go on
You don't want no real, what the deal is a mystery
How is it I can live and make history
If you don't see it then it, wasn't meant for you to see
If you wasn't born wit' it then, it wasn't meant for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be hound
Lock down in a cell wit' a soul gettin' dwelled
This is hell, go get the devil and get me the key
But can't be worst than the curse that was given ta me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone
There's a difference between, doin' wrong and being wrong
And that ain't right
Just keep it fair baby
Put me in the year, and I'll take it there baby
Yes
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
I'm a flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me death but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road, where you were told
That you would go, when you were old
And if you died young, it was told
So what the dilly, what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like what of his birth
What if it was a miscarriage and I never existed
Have I given something that have been taken away you
Would of missed it
Didn't know, did I persisted?
It was the call of the wild
I'm here to say what's in my heart, and you call it a style
Don't put it in the cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge, here it is eat it
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing I got it locked wit' this rap shit
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway, I'ma live on
But I'll be gone any day
Or give me death, uh uh uh, or take my breath
I'ma die anyway, but I'll be gone any day

I'll tell you why I can
Come on!
I'm gonna go hard
Whether I'm right or wrong
Till the dead and gone

I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard
Whether I'm right or wrong

What y'all really want?!
Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
How I live is simple
Walk through the streets
Talk to the beats
New York! I'ma eat
I never had a problem with surviving
No problem with getting down, busting my guns, or ruff rydin'
Cats talk slick but I talk slicker
My shits for real 'cause I'm that nigga
The reason that you hurtin' is you gotta take your problems
Straight to the lord, no body else can solve them (?)
See what I see but look through my eyes
The devil is a liar the truth never lies
We all got issues
Shit that we go through
Shit that we been through
Shit that we won't do
The pain that we bring upon ourself
For no reason, is the worst!
That's why I say I'm blessed with the curse
The Lord gave it all to me
And in the process, I lost my soul
Damn! the devil got a hold
In my mind, I'm like a little boy
Lost in crime
Like the healthy nigga that the devil forced into dying
The lord knows I'm trying
But at the same time
You hear the nigga with the weight of the world!
Why you gave it to Earl?
I'm gonna go hard

To live is to suffer
And I'm living it up
Face everyday chin up
I ain't giving it up
'Cause if I ain't giving a fuck
The who will?!
So I hope for the best
Knowing that it's all uphill
Sometimes I wonder what's lifes about
Sometimes I wonder why I take the wrong route
Then turn around and go out
And no doubt, the fate in mine is blind
So whatever, fuck it, I'ma roll out
We all go through the motions
We get different notions
We each have our own ocean
That we can either drown or float
Like the vessels that we are
Vessels that would carry many far
Don't know what to say, when you talking
Don't know who you gone see, when you walking
If you don't know how much of what you do is dirt
3 things you don't know gonna get you hurt!
Nigga!
I'm gonna go hard
Whether I'm right or wrong
Till the dead and gone
It's on!
What y'all really want?!
Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
I'm gonna go hard

130,Look Thru My Eyes,1998,It's Dark And Hell Is Hot (1998),Hip Hop,DMX,"Judge not and shall be judged first
Die nigga, die nigga
Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets
Burning in hell, but don't deserved to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
It's because they heard of me
And they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Be poppin', robbin and chill, take it over there bark wit' it
From Ohio to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flyin', a 129
Up the school street 'cause I come through mine
Barking my dogs, get at me nigga
Arf arf arf
Get at me nigga
What the deal is, never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say X is the best know he still is
Can't help but feel this, putting goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
Then come for the star
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's getting warm
Feel me yo
Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets
Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets
I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go
Feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark
About to bark, take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' getcha
With the steal, what you don't know is gon' splitcha
I can blaze tracks
Make niggas play raps and raise stacks
Paybacks a bitch, didn't you used to say that
Play around in dirt, you get mugged
'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns to mudred and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky
For real
Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets
I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time soldier eighth done told us not to hate
But then it's out of state, and it's too late
For change is to be made
That's what I get for fucking with strangers in the shade
This is it, that nigga's got to give me a place
For the same reason that fate, chose to give me away
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always his versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelings put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him
So I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly
Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets
Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets
Feel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy. For real.

Aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch
Cause of some bullshit I don't trust that bitch
Cause of the kid I'm stuck with that bitch
But my niggaz like, ""Yo FUCK THAT BITCH!""
""YOU DON'T GOTTA CHILL WITH HER!"" Man, they don't know
I'm still with her 'cause I'm tryin' to see the baby grow
That's just the pops in me, see I ain't never had one
And now that I am a father I don't wanna be a bad one
As shorty get older, how do I explain
That I really can't stand his mother? She a pain!
And I never really liked the bitch, out the gate
It was those two bottles of Remy, plus it was gettin' late
Now I ain't say I ain't had nothin' to do or to blame
Man I'm the Dog, bitches stay screamin my name
She knew it was a fuck thing, she ain't my wife
So why I gotta pay for her for the rest of my life?
Aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch
Cause of some bullshit I don't trust that bitch
Cause of the kid I'm stuck with that bitch
But my niggaz like, ""Yo FUCK THAT BITCH!""
Aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch
Cause of some bullshit I don't trust that bitch
Cause of the kid I'm stuck with that bitch
But my niggaz like, ""Yo FUCK THAT BITCH!""
Child support? You're killin' me! But it gets worse
Moms got a thirst that'll get her put in a hearse
Some say it's like a curse, the way she got me locked down
It feel like I'm trapped and I'm tryin' to get out now
From the beginnin, shit was cool
Check it, a nigga was hungry and this bitch was food
And I, wanted to eat till the Dog got full
'Cause I knew how I felt and the things that I would do
Bust it! From the beginnin you had my mind goin'
Look forward to seein you every time knowin'
Couldn't see shit cause, love was blind
Fuck it, that liquor is what gets you blind
Real talk!
Aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch
Cause of some bullshit I don't trust that bitch
Cause of the kid I'm stuck with that bitch
But my niggaz like, ""Yo FUCK THAT BITCH!""
Aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch
Cause of some bullshit I don't trust that bitch
Cause of the kid I'm stuck with that bitch
But my niggaz like, ""Yo FUCK THAT BITCH!""
I told you so (yo dawg, listen I love that bitch)
Not to fool with hoes (but I don't trust that bitch)

I told you so (my niggaz like, ""Man fuck that bitch"")
I told you so (aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch)
Not to fool with hoes (but I don't trust that bitch)

Stanky bitch, fuckin' bitch! Bitch, punk ass bitch
Ugly bitch, bitch, fuckin' nerves hate you bitch

Some moves hustlers gots to make.
And if you fake, you a snake.
(I gots to make a move and make it soon
I gots to take a block and make it boom)
Let me holla at y'all
It's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street
Till I knock off this rock I don't get to eat
Sometimes that's like that's the only reason why I hustle
Step on toes, strongarm and show a lil' muscle
Ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated
I hate it, seein mad niggaz that made it
And I'm robbin cats just as broke as myself
Livin' foul and ain't lookin' out for my health, where's the wealth?
Not in New York, cause niggaz talk about goin' out of state
Money got an eighth, comin' back, hot with a lot of weight
Where's my plate? I'm hungry too
So I'ma do like hungry do, and get a hungry crew
Niggaz that ain't never had, and doin' bad
Won't be bad to get up off that stoop lookin' sad
Grab your bags, it's about to go down
We goin' to this hicktown, let's get the lowdown, on how they get down
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (c'mon!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (c'mon?)
I gots to make a move and make it soon
Room
Found somethin' that could be somethin' if I pump it up
This kid Black is the only thing that like a ... it up
The purple top ?thirty-five smalls a ring of games?
But I'ma crush him with the black 40 double-L's
I send my peeps back up top, and come back
We chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop
It's four in the mornin, we on the block creepin'
Killin' the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin'
Look here, I'm what they call a true hustler
Cause nigga if I ain't know you since I was like six
Then I don't trust ya
And we'll bust ya over somethin' petty like a few dollars
Put somethin' hot up in that ass and watch you holla (Ah!)
You think I'm here for the flow? I want the dough flow
And get the po'-po', keep a fo'-fo'
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)

I spend my money my peeps 'cause they get me rich
And a honey ain't doin' nothin' but makin' me trick
We all family now, and we stand strong
Thirty niggaz on six blocks, makin' the cash long
It's all good, because niggaz gettin' what they been wantin
And we see the same thing, other New York niggaz frontin
Stick up kids huntin, but I ain't got no love for em
I keep the burner and the duster with the glove for em
Them mother... knockers come at us and chop us
And I know they, really tryin' to stop us and wanna drop us
So we pump, from the alley and the last house we use as a cash house
It's holdin' 'em strong, it's a stash house
I got runners that work for twelve hour shifts
And when them niggaz keep they count correct, I don't riff
But I ain't tryin' to hear that ... took your pack ...
Ain't tryin' to hear jack..., dirty black...
I ain't a greedy, all I want is a five year run
If I don't make it, then ... let me die near a gun
Got bitches to transport without an escort
I'm makin' moves from D.C. up to Westport
Local police ain't a problem 'cause they don't even stress us
It be them ATF that have you under pressure
Just so you know, ain't gon' never put my glock down (why?)
'Cause I'm a hustler, and I'm holdin' my block down
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (c'mon!)

Uh,
Mary J - what's on your brain,
Don't you know you can't diss where you came - from
The motherfucking slum,
You remind me of when you was a bum
Crazy dumb - getting hit in the hallway,
Building 5 - I heard you take it all ways
In the ass and especially the mouth,
You get on the radio and now you're from down south, the Bronx, or Brooklyn
Anywhere but from ???
Sure you know the place that you left your mom...
I'm from the motherfucking Y-O,
Where the niggas is real and the bitches act like they know
You fuckin' ho, you know I know
Cause my mutherfucking man Nas told me so
So did Little Jo, Big Coup and Derrick,
Wash from School Street and can't forget Eric.
Ain't you tired of getting hit with dicks
You even fucked my man Charles Oakley from the Knicks
You shouldn't use sex to get away from ???
You got niggas trooping to Fordham Road
Just to drop a load
Bitch you shouldn't have hoe'd
Everybody got your code
The pussy is sold - and your ass and face,
But I asked my man and he said it wasn't all that
Right about the time you were shopping the demo,
He tore your ass up in the back of a limo
And you didn't even care
You left your mom in ??? - on what WELFARE
Bitch you know you ain't right,
Matter fact what are you doing at about 8 o'clock tonight
You got the boots and I'm coming to get 'em
Is it true that after you fuck 'em, you'll make a record with him
If so then I'll be there and it won't be hard to find me,
Cause like I said before Mary J - You Remind Me!

Pull up wit' class on the don'.
Once I meet em' I greet em'.
Kiss his feet for freedom.
Tell em' thank you lord.
'Cause on Earth I was gettin' bored.
Now resurrect me back to this cat called Sheek.
So I can make this album.
And get back the cats that's weak.
Two thirty, six two.
Me bust for you that's like a cat vs. a pitbull.
Gun, know clip full, keep hunger.
And plan for the future, 'cause you figure
You gon' be older
Way longer than you gon' be younger.

Only time could tell how the clock ticks.
I'm really loved here but I'm still a hostage.
Two personalities check the posture.
Smoke out the mouth clear out the nostrils.
You think of death but the life seem scary.
I'm past the graveyard seein' people Hail Mary
I ain't chillin' till I'm out parachutin'.
Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds.
Twenty five thousand a piece.
Fuck streets!
Tryin' to own the island.
Forget about wilin'.
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'.
If I showed you where I lived you would think I was hidin'.
Sling dick to chicks that don't speak English.
Wake up in Trinidad, like fuckin' 'em rich.
Come back. Private jet
Live on set.

Whenever we drop this.
Monotonous for y'all to keep hatin',
'Cause y'all never gon' stop us.
I keep my rocks spotless,
And my hoes topless.
Take time try to figure out who tha Lox is.
Fear no one.
Kick rhymes like Shoguns.
You scared to blow one.
Get robbed wit' your own gun.
If I don't respect you I'm ah check you.
And if I don't kiss you I'm a peck you,
Right before I wet' chu.
I sneeze on tracks an' bless you.
I'm special.
And if you like workin' out,
Then I'm gon' stretch you.
Husslin' is dead but we still get red.
Turn the spots in the bakeries to get back bread.
And y'all said my monies spent.
But it's in the Bent'.
So when the feds come the dogs can't get a scent.

And watch em' come get em' up,

When you do dirt, you get dirt.
Bitch, I'll make your shit hurt.
Step back like I did worse.
This ain't no fucking game.
You think I'm playin', till you layin.
To where? The junkyard decayin'.
Mom's at home prayin' that chu comin' home.
But chu not, 'cause you sittin' up in the trunk startin to rot.
And hell is hot, I know because I'm here now Baby.
It's goin' down baby.
Get the full pound baby.
And let off up in a nigga,
Especially if he think he bigga'

Motha fuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether your for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows

And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother fuckers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you
Why would you fuck with me
Knowing I put you six feet deep and them niggas could die wit'cha
Cock the hot pistol and pop the hot Cristal
And promise you only one thing, to not miss you
Jahova know the god that served ya
Cause dead or alive when I arrive it's Murda
Shit I hope y'all niggas know to lay low now
Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down

Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light

Mouth that you recite with
Real life shit!

Quicker than hos
Shootin big holes
Rippin your clothes
Play games and have a thug nigga sit at your home
See you walkin' with that bitch when he spit at yo dome
Damn, ya brains all over the place!
Bitch cryin and screamin, 'cause ya brain's all over her face!
I got love for street thugs
And killers with deep mugs
Who bust they guns first then they start to cuss
Shook niggaz hold they guns till they start to rust
Bitch niggaz don't want no parts of us --

Tripped a few times off of angel dust
One shot turn yo brains to slush

You want it? We can go hard with the beats
Or hard to the body or hard to the teeth!
Yeah, I was on Universal -- they couldn't have it!
They kept me on the hush, like Whitney drug habit!
Got drafted, then made it to the front line
A year later, got traded to Bloodline
Now it's hard for cats to keep they spot
He rock too much ice, he can't keep it hot
And when all the ice melt, they all watered down!

I'm like a thief in the night
I creep in your life
One day when you nice
High off the Henny, catch you while you partyin, right?
With the semi, put your body on ice
For a price,
I'll make a bastard of your son as well as a widow of your wife!
My struggle was tight, love inside my heart has limits
Like anything outside of Bloodline, bound to get it
We bound to win it
Niggaz want, we bound to give it
And anything you cats start, you know we bound to finish
Can you see the cage is open? Muzzle is off
The .9 is sick, the silencer will muffle the cough
The Line is thick, Stan stay solo on cost
My shoulder will frost
On any nigga other than dog
I'm the one ya moms would hate you to cross
Of course,
If you the only child, who'll be left replacing the lost?
Please think before you go against the B.S.
And no, it's not a game, I'm one of Bloodline's best, nigga!
:
Whoa, whoa, whoa! They just keep bitin! The last to bite: that bitch, the bitch of the litter -- Crazy Kash, Kashmere... Get at 'em, girl!
:
What the fuck y'all niggaz know about grease?!
I got enough to put in ya piece
Plus bust ten in ya fleece
Make ya back bend in a crease
That's what you get offending a beast
You hatin' me like I was a friend of Kelis
Load, cock back and release
Bad bitch crackin' ya piece
Bullet holes in the back of your peeps
Always catch niggaz comin' from the back with the heat
Love to watch they knees buckle when they smack the concrete
You ain't gotta love me, just respect the bitch!
Scared to fight me? Get your girls, so I can wet the bitch!
Who gives a FUCK who ya old lady be?
I put holes in ya old lady tee
If she fuckin' with me!
You know my niggaz Stan, Jinx, Loose, Berg and X
Ya niggaz switchin occupations, 'cause they heard we next
No niggaz above mine
'Cause no niggaz above mine
And that shit's in my heart, 'cause it's in my fuckin' Bloodline!"

Fuck five mics, my fire burn the wire
'Cause we the niggas that plug
Wrap 'em in the rug
Flames mini blowin' on my hands like dust
Chicks wanna slurp?
Guaranteed I make ya burp
Just put your teeth to the curb
And hum a word
Some nerve, cats think they can touch the torch
You don't know about my gun just for me to toss
Fuck with the cars
I don't care what kind of drop ya pushin'
I put my fifteen to ya top and dump bullets
Yeah I see y'all cowards like to wear a vest
Well I'mma aim a little higher like for you neck
I puff lye, I'mma lift blunts till my arm look like Popeye
Till the day is bye-bye
Till then 300G fly by rented
So foggy windows look tinted
We just be lookin' at your Rolley at dem hot shows
So go ahead boy get drunk, pop that Mo
Until I pull ya to the side, see the nine kid?
And since you got that nice watch
You know what time it is

Bet'cha niggas always wonder
Why Drag always spit fire?
Why y'all always pop shit?
About how I burn niggas till they chocolate
'Cause I'm the opposite of H2O now ya know
Fix your wrinkled face, my iron press more than clothes
And girls I love 'em when I meet 'em
Might eat 'em
But when they act up, it's like Turner Tina
Don't me get the burner
Catch me in the low key Pontiac Sun sippin' Coniac
Y'all know how that affects blacks
So you know I clash that
Now where I'mma put all these gats and crack sacks
I'mma lil' nigga so you know I run fast
But don't do much of it do a lot of gun busting
'Cause when I let off a clip I get a kick
Outta seeing niggas run eyes open, hoping they don't trip
Hear the echoes blocks away
Type of bricklayers that hear shots today
And give your blocks away
Run up on papi hey drop the yay
And if he don't stall
This world be popped tomorrow
Drag-On speaks with a stutter but I rhyme well
So like a dead snitch it's hard to tell
Dirty, dirty niggas word
This is to my grimy, grimy niggas word
This is to my RR niggas, word
Yeah 'cause we double R niggas ya heard?

Uh... aha...
Niggas can't touch me kid
Niggas can't touch me kid
Niggas can't touch me kid
Niggas can't touch me kid
Ain't no way for me to say just how deep the flow gets
Still wakin' up in cold sweats, over old threats
And I done did more time than a clock, from the hallow to the rock
I represent on every block
It's the Dizark! Straight out the Grizound!
And from now on this is how Shizits goin' Dizown!
Clizown, come through squashin toes.
Don't even breathe 'cause in jail you was washin clothes.
Get in front of hoes and start fakin' G, as you tell it you gettin' dough like a bakery
Makin' me Schemin plots at yo ass like a dream I put that head to bed and you can dream a lot!
Funny shit is before I shot tha nigga, you shoulda seen how the bitch came up out tha nigga!
Now I got tha nigga but I could run up in 'em made 'em say ""Daddy"" before I put the gun up in em
One up in em, two three, empty the clip, Have his whole head lookin' like a busted lip
And I skip, 'cause I can't stand another case
Went to his wake so I could laugh at the look on his mother's face
Even though I know it ain't shit funny about knockin' a nigga off just to get money
I still do what I gots to and just be grateful that I neva got you 'cause I woulda SHOT YOU!

Straight up ruthless, let's leave yo man truthless, 'cause ain't nothin' givin' nigga
I been gruddy 'cause just long as I can remember since 1970 the eighteenth of December
Earl Simmons, the bastard that nobody wanted was born
Niggas showed me a joint made 'em run it, it's on.
Can't a bank around the way say I ain't stuck it
Quick as I cap a body I can be one, so fuck it!
I ain't got shit to lose but my life
Plug you in the gut and watch the blood ooze down my knife
I laugh at death 'cause to me it's funny
Don't give a fuck about shit, what matters to me is Money!
Sonny, I could teach yo ass a trick or two about stackin the dough, mackin a ho' and what the bitch'll do
I drove a bitch until the bitch is worthless
Have her suckin my man's dick and make it look good on the surface
A nigga get the same treatment
I'm leavin' guts on walls, and brains all over the cement
But no remorse for the corpse 'cause I still kick em
He ain't bleedin' enough so I stick em
And I will have another body
Kinda like how I feel when I'm blowin' up another party
And shit is crackin' in the hood now so I'm good now, talkin' 'bout you good now? Oh you good? Hah
Niggas can't touch me kid

Niggas can't touch me kid

Plenty of niggas know dirty is how I do em
Push buckshots from a 30 right through em
'Cause ain't none of y'all muhfukkas built for war
And I lay down the law when I spray down ya door
Fuck around and my name'll be ninety five be 64 eleven on the three and a half to seven
But even up north I put niggas to waste so if you wanna stop the violence
Get the fuck out my face!
The open door, peeps hit the floor,
Bitches is fuckin' but I sleeps with the sawed off!
I got shit to do, crews to rake, moves to make,
Wait for the news to break, I got dues to take
I don't joke 'cause jokers is cards
And cards are what I pull
Infrared with the clip full, no leash on my pitbull
This shit is hot like the wax off a candle stick
But how I handle shit, is to dismantle shit (DunDunDunDunDuhDaDa)
Like Popeye and it's spinach time, runnin' through niggas like a tape at the finish line
What ya crew gonna do when I put the pressure on?
And it hurts wanna be gangstas in skirts?
And the bitch is comin' all up out the nigga!
One false move and they mom's will read about the nigga
And they girls will be without the nigga
Matta fact, don't try the money throw ya joints up, just scrap

Or I'ma torture this niggaz little sister and make him watch
Give a nigga a little room, now he's tryin' to house shit
But I bet you get back on some mouse shit
When I punch you in your mouth, bitch
Ah, a nigga broken off quick

How you feel, eatin with a straw he has to suck through
Fuck me? No fuck you, now I gotta touch you
Fuckin' bitch suckin dick like a jockstrap

Tryin' to be the first punk motherfucker that shot back

Eyes rolled back in his head, coughin up chunks of flesh
Then niggaz'll roll with his monstrous death, beatin' punks to death
Ain't nothin' left but the memory of what used to be your life
Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife
Y'all motherfuckers don't understand, when it's on it's on
You up in the casket with some shades, 'cause your eyes is gone
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid
But you made it happen, with that bullshit you did

Don't worry about me 'cause I'm gonna ball
Cal' city ridin' half way through and they like like
Not know me ye but I'll do it
Just last week wasn't really nothing to it
Catch slim shit, wish I'd do it
Know what it is, same old rappers is like
Watch the movie knowing what's going to happen
Check it, you do you I do me
The Dog gon' be all right you'll see
I've been down this road before I'm sure
This is the battlefield and I'm built for war
Ain't nothing new to an OG
Bullshit each other hard time they all know me
Getting there, the dick ballas, the insiders
But the ones that we let get in ridin' beside us
Keep your friends close, enemies closer
I got it, now I put 'em all in one pocket
If I can't fuck with you for real I can't fuck with you at all
That means y'all, but when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm gonna ball
If I can't fuck with you for real I can't fuck with you at all
That means y'all, but when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm gonna ball
I wish I could believe, I wanna count on you
Never get to worry about me, whether on you
Have to make it to the bottom of the sea when it was for
You took the snake, you made me trust all
I trust you to stab me in the back
Trust you to stuck one in your mouth
Soon as I walk out
Trust you to steal from me like greedy
Acting like we love each other why do me
Everything about you is crooked, look it
Fed a nigga some bullshit, I took it
That's what I get all for fucking with a hybrid
Most of you talk about the sides
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, did what you supposed to do
Ain't never even thought about biting the hand that feeds me
Good job motherfucker, it's greedy
If I can't fuck with you for real I can't fuck with you at all
That means y'all, but when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm gonna ball
If I can't fuck with you for real I can't fuck with you at all
That means y'all, but when you get caught up don't even call
Don't worry about me 'cause I'm gonna ball"

Dirt gettin' tossed in your grave
Now it's all over
Preacher said ""You was brave""
But now it's all over
You just one of the many, plenty I done gave it to
(*Boom*) Ain't no savin' 'you
No matter how many tears your moms' cried
Ain't gon bring your ass back
Plus in hell, you gon fry
Why? But now the only 2 releative questions
Is ""Do we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?""
Either way, you up out of here for good
Now when niggaz mention you name
They knockin' on wood
Did I, get my, point across?

Another joint I toss

But this shit is thick and when you hear this shit
Damn right I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine
But you be blind, I'll do it 360, come up from behind
Tap you on the shoulder, have you turnin' around
Hit you with somethin' that I'll have you burin' the ground
Be like ""Damn ain't nothin' left of money, but a pile of ash""
Life is good, so please enjoy it, while it lasts
'Cause you know you ain't got much longer to go
The quicker you go depends the stronger the flow

I gotta make it out and move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me.
Bet this time around they won't scare me.
I am the last one
""The champ""
Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front lines with my weapon
I am the last one
Damn
I went through it again
After telling everybody I wouldn't do it again
I kind of feel like I've let my people down
Yup
But to get them right
I gots to pick myself up
When I heard this beat and hook
It was so raw
Looked in the mirror
Didn't like what I saw
But all I could say was
Shits gotta change
(For real)
Either get it right or take one to the brain.
If y'all knew the pain that I went through daily
Trying to stay sane through the wind
Y'all hear me
I'm slipping, falling, I can't get up
But this time I'm out of control
I don't give a fuck
But for the thugs
I'm the last hope for the team
I'm the reason why some niggas
Got a hole in their dreams
These cats know what's good
I am the hood
I ain't hoping that they don't
I wish a nigga would.
I gotta make it out and move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me.

I am the last one

Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front lines with my weapon
I am the last one
I gots to do it for me
Do it for them
I ain't playing with this shit
I'm a' do it to win
Know I can do it again
'Cause I did it before
With little to no effort
And Y'all niggas know the story.
First album dropped in May
Second in December
Both were Platinum in one year like
Y'all don't remember
Only nigga who's first five albums
Debut at number one
Wonder why I call you son
My son, I've just begun
To get started up with the hardest part of it all
It's to climb a slippery wall and
Stil don't fall
Break down and call up to God
When it get too hard
I know you ain't gonna let me go now
Brought me too far
Showed me I was a star,
All my life, I know it
All ain't right, before I call it a night
I'm a thank you for it all
The blessings and the curses
And I hope you're listening
'Cause there's a lesson in the verses
Yeah
I gotta make it out and move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me.
Bet this time around they won't scare me.

See money get high, I don't knock what a nigga do to get by
Just make sure you gettin' by don't FUCK with you gettin' mine
Ain't the first time he ran off, shoulda split his shit then
Hate to think of what he's did and if I catch him slippin
Won't be an ass-whippin, I can tell you that
I keep it real with this cat, he go and sell two packs
And run off (damn) tell me, he was locked down, up North
And you out a week later? That's bullshit!

Matter of fact, you hit the back, I'll put two in that nigga

172,Prayer,2012,Undisputed (2012),Hip Hop,DMX,":
Lord Jesus, you have brought me from a place so dark, to the point where I can now feel the love in my heart.
And I know it’s just a start, for there is more to come, so now I embrace it when I used to run.
Didn’t know what I was running from or running towards, until one day I saw it; I was running from the Lord.
And when I came back you accepted me with open arms and said ""All is forgiven.""
And I became so strong that I could fight off the devil with just spoken words, say it, Devil I rebuke you, and I saw that I was heard.
Because no matter what I've been through, I could deal with it.
And because of what I went through, I was still fitted - With the armor that comes with the blood of Jesus.
Knowing even when we are suffering, he sees us.
Or when you're lost he will lead the flock to find the one, just like any father trying to find his son.
And let me remind you: no matter where you at he will find you, and help you put the negative behind you.
Lord, give me a sign!
Please let me know you're here, or at least let me know you're near.
Remind me to call you, when we need you.
Remind me to call you, because we all need to.
And give us the strength to just make it through just one more day.
In Jesus's mighty name we pray. 
Amen."
173,Prayer (Skit),1998,It's Dark And Hell Is Hot (1998),Hip Hop,DMX,"I come to you hungry and tired, you give food and let me sleep
I come to you weak, you give strength and that's deep
You called me a sheep, and lead me to green pastures
Only asking that I keep the focus, in between the chapters
You give me the word, and only ask I interpret
And give me the eyes, that I can recognize the serpent
You know I ain't perfect, but you'd like me to try
Unlike the devil who just wants me to lie, till I die
Lord why is it that, I go through so much pain
All I saw was black, and all I felt was rain
I come to you because it's, you who knows
You showed me that everything is black, because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light, and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right, that when you asked for this story
I put together, to do our dogs some good
Our dogs being, brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way, but I hid
And I remember once you held me close, but I slid
There was something that, I just had to see
That you wanted me to see, so I can be what you wanted me to be
And I think I've seen it, 'cause I don't feel the same
Matter of fact I know I have seen it, I can feel the change
And it's strange, almost got me beating down your door
But I've never known love, like this before
It's a wonderful feeling, to get away from the pain
And up under the ceiling, I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here, is gone
I know real so I wipe away the tears, with a song
And I almost lost faith, when you when you took my man
Monty, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan
And I fear that what I saying, won't be heard until I'm gone
But it's all good, 'cause I really didn't expect to live long
So if it takes for me to suffer, for my brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die, but please lord treat him right"
174,Prayer III,1999,...And Then There Was X (1999),Hip Hop,DMX,"Let us pray
Lord Jesus it is you, who wakes me up every day
And I am forever grateful for your love...
... This is why I pray
You let me touch so many people, and it's all for the good
I influenced so many children, I never thought that I would
And I couldn't take credit for the love they get because it all comes from you Lord;
I'm just the one that's givin' it
And when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much
I take time out and pray, and ask that you be my crutch
Lord I am not perfect by a longshot -- I confess to you daily
But I work harder everyday, and I hope that you hear me
In my heart I mean well, but if you'll help me to grow
Then what I have in my heart, will begin to show
And when I get goin', I'm not lookin' back for NOTHIN'
'Cause I will know where I'm headed, 'cause I'm so tired of the sufferin
I stand before you, a weakened version of, your reflection
Beggin for direction, for my soul needs resurrection
I don't deserve what you've given me, but you never took it from me
Because I am grateful, and I use it, and I do not, worship money
If what you want from me is to bring your children to you
My regret is only having one life to do it, instead of two
Amen"

Only reason y'all still breathing is cause y'all run
When we bust shots
My nigga clutch Glocks
Broad daylight in front of precincts --- fuck cops!
Niggaz want pops?
Then they die for them
Kiss the barrel, cry for them
Spirit leave your body touch the sky for them
Fuck Voltron! See what me and mines form
In the nine storm!
Death -- time's gone!

I know how to flip on a nigga, split him with the bat
I know how to train a pup to make sure they scratch (WHAT?!)
You motherfuckers don't want no problems
'Cause my revolver is solving them
One by one, until it's all of them!

Don't you test me, boy!
Don't fuck with X or DRAG TO THE DASH, 'cause once you dumped in these bags,
You DRAGGED TO THE TRASH dumpster, among the rest of them fags!
My poker got your skin looking like acupunctures; Keep a silence on the tip --- can't afford the noise
My banger got a ""Jagged Edge"" like them four boys
If your hot, I'll Super-Soak you, and you won't be able to dry it off
Just relax, take your last breath, and die it off!
Nothing but love I spread
But if you take advantage the weight that's lead
Will rush your head
Your sweat'll die your hair red
Like my bitch Eve
And no, I'm not a faggot, but I make niggaz striptease
In front of me
It's fun to me, bitches!

181,Pure Uncut Remix,2001,The 24th Letter (2001),Hip Hop,DMX,"DMX McGruff and Canibus.
You know where you heard it first.
My man Cardin, G Black, Ralph, Universal Records.
Uh [all echoes]. Pure Uncut,
DMX (What?) DMX, McGruff, McGruff, and Canibus, baby.
Yeah, it's the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw.
It's the Pure Uncut, raw we keep it raw. Listen...
Niggas at Ruff Ryders is the illest, baby gorillas
And shit we do today is gon' catch up with us and kill us
Long as I feel this, motherfucker's head is shot
Fucking lead is hot, and leave them dead to rot
Ruff Ryders cut the shit up, like raw keys
Like that crystal aching my last ?name is Raheed?
It can happen niggas, dog keys, and still gun it down
Only 'cause I know how you look up to a nigga, from the ground
Running clown, you no better, than ?a braveless heart?
?For my kids? I thank you God
And if you don't know, ask a nigga, that they just put in the ground
Slugs ran out of him, so I must've put in a pound
At least! I gave it to another nigga for lookin'
Money, ?could never stop my slugs? from cookin
Remember me, 'cause I'ma be there when they bury, you
And we'll just get it on in the cemetery
Dum, du-du, dum
Who got the, who got the bum bu-bu bum?
We wrap it up and smoke it, sixty green
I'm a fiend for this rap thing
Down South hustiln' and we all about the cream
Stick 'em up, mad face, car chase through the city
Fuck the police, I'm mad plus I'm going off that gritty
Frank ?Nitty? got a mob down to murder with me
Catch one to stick me, believe it or not, I cripply
I rip thee, back into a stack and flip it like a tech
Pure uncut, tie it up, and watch the fiends come back
Bucklin, real dogs stay around for troublin
8Ball, pick up the ball, when them tricks start bumblin
Rumblin (vrooom) much room, cloud trippin'
Victims who lie there die when I be speakin', releasin
You heard me, are you worthy
To ride with the Suave House and get down and dirty?
It's the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
It's the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
Baby Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
It's the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
(What?) Nigga, Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
It's the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
It's the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
Baby Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
It's the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
(What?) Nigga, Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
Yo; where the fuck is the dough? its time to bubble and blow
If I spit this from the back, have 'em clutchin they ?toes?
Once smoked my lungs out, but now I fuck with my nose
Perform shows, bad bitches crunchin my clothes
Yo I'm 'Gruff, street thug beyond the speakers, beyond the rap
Man I'm on a car and my gat, swarm attack, sip Don and Cognac
Ain't just me, my whole freakin army strapped
Aiyyo, fuck that! And fuck you! Who the fuck you?
Touch you, you act like you want trouble
Money don't know you, don't rub you, I got' eat, that's like trying to tell me don't hustle
I gotta blow a couple, niggas away just to show the muscle
Yo, I squeeze till your vocal tussle
Niggas please, I got keys, coke, and snow to bubble
Hoes to cuff you, fuck you, suck the shit out your dick
Sucker for love, think you can fuck with McGruff?
Now listen mister
Gruff put your soul in a twister
Just got off the payphone, on a three-way line, with 8Ball and Tony Draper
Askin me for a favor
Now let me take it from the top I touch your knot, with the rubber glock
Then I take your title, nigga, fuck your spot
Peace to the players who crush a lot, but they call me Canibus because I bust a lot
You can suck my cock, and got the same transmitted disease your mother got
Being a favorite with me right before she was forced to pop
She came home at four o'clock, was shot, she was riding me on top
I told the bitch to keep the door locked, I know your heating up hot
Because I touched the sure spot, you got defeated and dropped
I punch you in the jaw-ops
You talk dirt, you get dirt that's how I stand on niggas networks
You think that best works? You think you can't get hurt?
The bitch in you, makes you run for cover when I spit at you
A man-to-man zone Allen Iverson couldn't dribble through
Rapid fire syllables, you gotta bribe me with a mill or two
To keep me from killing you with the lyrical
All you chief executives ampin ?answer? wreckin shit
See, what goes around comes around, bitch"
182,Put 'Em Up,2010,Mixtape (2010),Hip Hop,DMX,"This is the way it's the way it's supposed to be
This is the way that I say that it's gonna be
This is the way that I say it's supposed to be
This is the way that I say that it's gonna be
Let me go, nigga, back up off me
Dog out the cage, cats walk softly
Talk real lightly, scared to bite me
Scared to death to shoot me, scared to fight me
In the street niggas is playing the wrong game
Up in a real nigga face, saying the wrong thang
At the end of the day, what that really mean?
Come on, let this bitch ass nigga flee
He ain't mean no harm, he ain't mean nuttin' by it
It ain't mean no wrong, you's a grown ass man
Let 'em know, dick ain't for ridin'
Dick is for findin' pussy, then hidin'
What is my dick doing in your mouth?
This ain't a pacifier nigga, c'mon, take that out, please
Oh shit bitch, this is how dog get down
Hands in the air whenever dog hit town
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on

Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Y'all niggas heard it through the grape vine
What's that? X is back, I'ma take mine, yeah
Name of the game is get in where you fit in, dog
Nigga, I fit in at the beginnin'
Cats living, jumpin' out the window
Where'd money go? Yo, right out the window
Whether it's rock and roll, I lock and load
Shut 'em down, open up shop, oh no, com on
Dick ridin' niggas, stay up in it, where you goin' dog?
Upside your fuckin' head in minute
First you pick the dudes, stick and move
Witness smooth, real simple, stick to the rules
Why you gotta make shit complicated? I hate it
Y'all keep a nigga aggravated
Then rate it, loading up let the hungry eat
911, it's a beast running loose in the streets
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on

183,Ready to Meet Him,1998,"Flesh Of My Flesh, Blood Of My Blood (1998)",Hip Hop,DMX,"(Talking)
Let us pray
I thank you Lord for my birth, and everything that's followed
I thank you Lord for today, and I will pray for tomorrow
I thank you Lord for the love of my life, and a friend
I made a promise and I'm loving my wife to the end
I thank you Lord for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts
And right here, right now, Lord, this is your house
I thank you Lord for a dream that came true to light
And I ask you to bless everybody, in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing, and I ask you to forgive me
'Cause I need you here with me, without You in my life it's empty
I think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know
There's something better after here, but everybody, won't go
So I ask you to forgive them, and we'll hope they see
And I thank you for the love that, they've given to me
I will not abuse it, nor will I lead them astray
You see I love them like children, that I see everyday
And I pray, no we pray, together
Get us through the bad weather, and we'll love you forever
Let your thought and my heart, go hand in hand
I first thought, but to start, but I stand a man
And for as long as I can, as long as you permit me
Please give me, the strength I need to live, bear with me
Amen
We each walk the path, that we've chosen
(Singing)
I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the lord
Lord, you left me stranded
And I don't know why
Told me to live my life
Now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly
I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me you would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still coming at me
Just missing
Sometimes I think all you doing me is just listen
I thought that I was special
That's what you told me
Hold me
Stop acting like you don't know me
What I do so bad that it sent you away from me
Not only sent you away, but made you stay away from me
(
)
Follow your word, and be true
(
)
Well, what I wanted to do
(
)
Darkness and hell at a glance
(
)
All I want is another chance
I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
(
)
Ya see, I left home a boy, I returned as a man
Full grown, and I'm still not able to stand
(
)
Well... but I was looking the wrong way
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray
And that prayer, took me from here to over there
Back to over here,
Now they got me like where?
Do I belong?
Do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart
I'm really tryin' to win, so where do we start?
(
)
But, what if he stole from me?
(
)
But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
(
)
I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
Our father, who art in heaven
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27
No longer afraid to knock on your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord
'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that I've seen, what I need to see
Please take me, where I need to be
(
)
It's better to tell the truth than to lie
(
)
To love my life until I die
(
)
Violence isn't always the key
(
)
You can't always believe what you see
(
)
It's better to forgive and forget
(
)
Give as you expect to get
(
)
That I can't go on without you
(
)
I must've been a fool to ever doubt you
I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him"

I been doin' this for a minute
So with or without you I'ma get it, 'cause I'm in it to win it
I put in work, paid my dues
Stepped in dirt, changed my shoes
Got those dirty - asked God for a new pair
And He musta heard me; thought I was worthy
Taught me to listen cause in New York
The rule is the more you know the less you talk
So if you fake niggaz actin' like you down for the kid

But when it's all good same niggaz suck dick
Money is the root of all evil
I ain't a fake nigga, and never had a reason to deceive you
Don't nobody do for me, but me
A nigga gon' be all right, you'll see
When I need a friend, [?] sends me one
When I need some ends, he saved me some
Whatever I need I get it, so I don't want for nothin'
And I ain't gotta hunt for nothin'
Sittin' on ten whips, a few chips
And that mayne with the laser from the hip catch you slip

Keep the block roastin Light a dutch wit the flames comin', toastin
In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin'
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty
Cause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry Or catch one early
You wrong, tryin' to touch me, what type of shit you on?
You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
'Cause I'm comin' through wit a Yukon Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin', send your casket, throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggaz is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a Backdraft cause my fire retirin, aight then
It's my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a lover slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a f... fort
Caught up in somethin' that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Clue!
Wasted, in the fuckin' streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass unbder the earth quick,
I Love money, but the scrambles hot
So I snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, when niggaz shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his f... vest"

We scorn niggaz like they mothers, then we wet up they socks
Red dot, excapin on a radar, to seashore, then hide out
And buy out bars till we see far
In this game, we beat y'all, you got money?
Keep y'alls, for us be tearin tryin' to hide, then tear out fire
Beat y'alls
Uh, nah, yo, uh, uh, yo, yo
And you can come see me if you tryin' to get some
Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin the flights
Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning wit dykes
Blowin' the haze, while all of 'em givin' me brains
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
But everybody wanna contact me, and get wit me
And still end up bein mad 'cause I charge 50
And as for you suckaz, you can keep those rapz
And screw yo awardz, my son can't eat those plaques
I never was shipped but some thingz I never forget
Like if you spent three you guaranteed to make back six
Drove the benz off the lot and just dusted her off
Tints, rims, stashed, tick the governor off
Even the catz that be hatin' still be lovin' the dogz
'Cause they know that the double r's comin' for war
Wha
Uh-huh
You ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
'Cause when I start bustin' the gunz you hidin the kids
And the pieer's still ridin' wit clips, survivin wit bricks
We beefin on the 4th you got to die on the 5th
Like I wasn't hustlin dope or robbin the blocks
Starvin or not, carvin the cheek, palmin the glock
I figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch
I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist
Put it together, double it twice this shit is my life
Catch me wit a .45, hot pair of nikes
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face
Gimmie a shank it's holiday (uh)
The hooptie's in the front but the truck is a mile away
Niggaz wanna ride tomorrow when they'll probabaly die today
'Cause da pio'll hollow the gunz
Then holla at son (I feel you nigga)
And when he go to holla back, niggaz swallowin one
Uh
Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggaz and hit whoever
When you should aim for them niggaz that took yo leather
They right there, but you scared that they gon bust
'Cause they crazy, but crazy niggaz bleed like us
See I'm one shot through the heart like cupid
Y'all niggaz might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
It's 99, I'm killin' you, woman and kid
Fuck scarface, watch me, I'm mo action to see
Than the muthafuckaz that y'all see on TV
And fuck what you heard, check how sheek get down
Comes the gun, shit, I'm rhymin wit one on me now
You neva know, what clown could walk in the studio
Talkin' shit, and there's gon be more than the amps that blow
I'll pour gas on yo skin and watch yo shit detach
Wit a book of matches, now dats when you met yo match
And the worst thing for you is for me to have a gun when I'm thirsty
I'll turn niggaz more holy man, than eddie murphy
And I deal wit mo bricks than that city do in jersey
I got call cops niggaz, I got autops niggaz, that'll bust you and slide
Wit some of 6-drop niggaz
Revolver pop niggaz, easy ox niggaz, get knocked
Say I smoked detox niggaz
Drug program, hit the streetz and cop 56 mo gramz
Y'all niggaz ain't fuckin' wit the fam and dats word
Hey yo boy, what's the difference between fire and water?
You whether drown or die off torture, cause yo skins of ya
And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo bitch a perm wit that
Keep shellz in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets
More blood that a riot on a jailhouse footage
Buck 40, got a extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you
You gon do a 360 pretty swiftly
When I burn you to a crisp you gon be crunchier than chips
Wit my hand all up in the bag, munchin on this shit
Bit by bit, clip by clip and every block by block is brick on brick
So I got knots on knots, got thingz that'll pop yo top
And double r spot yo block wit 16 shots and watch y'all drop
And ain't nobody gettin' up, lest they in the wheelchair
Sittin' up or spittin' up, either way I don't give a fuck"

""I just called you and you said Domino's Pizza but, and you said you were on your way but there's just one problem, I'm all the way to fuck in Rochester, New York. Wrong ho!""
Uh, yo yo
Yo, not this shit again
Dog gon' be a dog, y'knahmean? Motherfuckin dog!
Don't GET a dog, you can't take care of a dog
Gotta take care of the dog, y'know? Y'know?
Take it easy lady, y'know? Uh-huh
Give me a motherfuckin break - will ya?
Shorty was the bomb, brownskin honey with a little dough
Come to find out she was a little ho, but still yo
I pushed up, shorty had that ass like BLA-DOW
Had me schemin on how, I could get that now
Was like GIRLFRIEND (what?!) let me drop a bug in yo' ear
She was mine 'cause I told her what she wanted to hear
Was like yeah, she knew how it was goin' down
She said page me, code zero, 'cause I know you get around
Didn't have a man but even if she did DEAD
Cause my game is tight like a stocking cap on a nigga's head
I said - we'll get up like nine or somethin'
Don't act like, when I say that ass is mine I'm frontin
That night was right, she let me get that, hit that
Rip that, bounce it off the walls, flip that
But only, one thing went wrong, the rubber bust
But I didn't fuss cause dog, shorty was the bomb!
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that niiiight
But maaan the pussy was good (uh-huh)
But shorty's fuckin' up my liiife, fuckin' up my life
Shorty, UH!
We only did it for that niiiight (just one motherfuckin night man!)
But maaan the pussy was good
(Was good as a motherfucker, I ain't gon' front)
But shorty's fuckin' up my liiife (uh-huh)
C'mon ma, give me a break
A few days later, I hit her up, just to keep it real (aight)
Was like - whassup Boo, how you been, how you feel? (aight)
She said - aight, but my friend's kinda late
Today's the 13th, and it shoulda been here on the 8th
I'm like - f'real?! Don't stress it, it'll come
It better, 'cause I can't afford another, little one
She said - neither can I, I said - cool
'Cause I got mad shit to do and you still goin' to school
So at least we had the same thing in mind (uh-huh)
Not to have this kid and, everything would be fine, BUT, I was blind
To the fact that she was settin me up, for the kill (c'mon)
Damn, why wasn't she, on the pill?
And I still, would check on her like, once a week
Sometimes I hit it, sometimes I didn't, but shorty was a freak
And whenever I would speak on the baby
Shorty would be like - I ain't havin' this kid, is you crazy?
But shorty, UH!
We only did it for that niiiight
(Man listen man, one motherfuckin night)
But maaan the pussy was good
(I ain't gon' front, pussy was good as a motherfucker)
But shorty's fuckin' up my liiife
(Oh MAN this bitch is a fuckin' HEADACHE!) fuckin' up my life
Shorty, UH! (Shorty was definitely a bomb dog)
We only did it for that niiiight
(One motherfuckin night, AND I was drunk)
But maaan the pussy was good
(The pussy, MAN! Let me tell you)
But shorty's fuckin' up my liiife (Dog, this bitch is a problem)
C'mon ma, give me a break
By now, wasn't lookin' too good
'Cause she wasn't doin' things that she told me she would
Like gettin' the price checked out for what we had to do
And it goes up another yard for every month after two
And a half I had to laugh out of frustration (WHAT?!)
Now she's fo' months, I'm ready to hit the bus station (man)
If I was, still on that shit it woulda made me rob her
Told her friends - DMX? Yeah that's my baby's father (uh-oh)
Her lil' stomach is shown (uh-huh) so now the heat is on
Maybe she'll see the light, if I start to treat her wrong
Like if she thought that if she kept the baby she would keep me (what?)
So I played the game on her level, got sneaky (aight?!)
Let her have the kid, she said it was premature (uh-huh)
Found out, she was six months, when she said she was four (uh-huh)
So I left her with the pressure on the next man's arm
But she'll be aight, cause shorty was the bomb (f'real)
But shorty, UH! (was the bomb)
We only did it for that niiiight
(I mean what, one fuckin' night? C'mon ma)
But maaan the pussy was good (man she sucked a mean dick)
But shorty's fuckin' up my liiife
(Now this bitch won't stop callin, what the fuck man?)
Fuckin' up my life
Shorty, UH! (She was kinda cute though)
We only did it for that niiiight (All it takes is one night man, haha)
But maaan the pussy was good (mmm-mm-mmm!)
But shorty's fuckin' up my liiife (This bitch, has got to go)
C'mon ma, give me a break"

And to survive
Well, that's to find meaning in the sufferin

Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
I been through mad different phases, like mazes
To find my way 
And now I know that happy days are not far away
If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
Doin somethin more constructive with they time, than bids
I know because I been there, now I'm in there
Sit back and look at what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit, the drama with my Mama
She got on some fly shit so I split
And said that I'ma be that
Seed that doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed, a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Baggin' niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinking about how short I was
Goin too fast it wouldn't last but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions, prepare my ass for jail
They put me in the situation forcin me to be a man
When I was just learnin to stand without a helpin hand, damn
Was it my fault, somethin I did
To make a father leave his first kid?
At seven doin my first bid
Back on the scene at fourteen
With a scheme to get more green
Than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be livin high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
That's my only mother-fucker I had offered my last
Just another little nigga, headed nowhere fast

Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Hey yo I'm slippin, I'm fallin, I can't get up
Hey yo I'm slippin, I'm fallin, I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
That ain't the half, shit get's worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pitch, startin shit for kicks
Catchin vicks, throwin bricks, just gettin by bein slick
Used to get high just to get by
Used to have to puff my
L in the mornin before I could fly
I ate somethin, couple a forties made me hate somethin
I did some coke now I'm ready to take somethin
Three years later showin signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side, livin the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga wit a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fuckin it up
I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up
Hey yo I'm slippin, I'm fallin, I can't get up
Hey yo I'm slippin, I'm fallin, I can't get up

And that means no more gettin high, drinkin forties
So I get back lookin type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothin but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong
Kept a nigga from doin wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is yo fuckin song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through

If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
Doin somethin more constructive with they time, than bids
I know because I been there, now I'm in there
Sit back and look at what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit, the drama with my Mama
She got on some fly shit so I split
And said that I'ma be that
Seed that doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed, a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Baggin' niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinking about how short I was
Goin too fast it wouldn't last but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions, prepare my ass for jail
They put me in the situation forcin me to be a man
When I was just learnin to stand without a helpin hand, damn
Was it my fault, somethin I did
To make a father leave his first kid?
At seven doin my first bid
Back on the scene at fourteen
With a scheme to get more green
Than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be livin high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog

That ain't the half, shit get's worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pitch, startin shit for kicks
Catchin vicks, throwin bricks, just gettin by bein slick
Used to get high just to get by
Used to have to puff my
L in the mornin before I could fly
I ate somethin, couple a forties made me hate somethin
I did some coke now I'm ready to take somethin
Three years later showin signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side, livin the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga wit a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fuckin it up

Sometimes I wonder why, I'm a hood and a fiend
Sometimes I look at what I've become and cry
Sometimes I, get on that BULLSHIT and be ready to die
Sometimes a nigga that's yo' man might get it
Sometimes even though it's sweet, if you ain't wit it
Sometimes the pain is too much to BEAR
Sometimes it RAINS too much to care
Sometimes if you, don't watch yo' back it'll cost you
Sometimes you wonder, who would give a FUCK if they lost you

214,Tales From The Darkside,2002,Rap Sheet (2002),Hip Hop,DMX,"And now, the tale from the darkside...
Uh, I got to remind y'all niggas
What the flow is all about
Huh, it's about this
Anywhere from forty-eight and up
Straight, you feel me?
Fifty fifty
Aiyyo, I gots to hear the beat so I can eat, ahight?
If I can't live, you can't live, ain't nothin' sweet
Bitch ass niggas think it's all about versace
A week later them niggas talkin' about (yo, x got me)
I thought he was my man, but he act like he ain't know me
I knew he had the joint, but I didn't wanna make him show me
That nigga be buggin, stickin cats up and random
Doing his dirt and disappearin like the phantom
Niggas can't stand him, but ask me if I care
'Cause what I used to give a fuck about, just ain't there
And ain't nothing fair, I knew this for a long time
That's why with ever wrong crime comes anotha strong rhyme
And that's mo' time under the belt, you felt what I had
And I shouldn't have even done it, that's what made this shit sad
I'm doin' bad, but if I gots to feel it, you gots to feel it
And if a nigga can't afford it, I gots to steal it
And that's how real it, gets, when this shit [hits the fan]
You still tryin' to get the man, first catch up with the man
Then we gon' see what'choo made of
If your shit ain't pumpin kool-aid, what you afraid of?
The monster under the bed, fill ya with four slugs to the head
Or ya babies mother missin' for a month, found dead
Worms comin' from places you stuck ya dick in
Maggots got the bitch coverered and the smells sick'nen
Plastic don't hide the smell for too long, I do wrong
And so I don't have nightmares I forget about it, move on
Keep gettin' my groove on, 'cause that shit could fuck with'choo
Keep dwellin on it, and it's gonna get stuck with you
Niggas try their luck with you, 'cause they smell ass
And money if you pussy, I'm gonna be able to tell fast
Some cop I'm about to smack across the face in this robbery
I'm on a robbin spree, and ain't no stoppin' me
On this real, that's why a nigga stay writin
'Cause kid this shit is real, what you think we play fightin
You must of saw som'thin funny, or never saw som'thin bloody
Or you don't know I'll bring it to your door 'cause I'm cruddy
Like puddy, when I hold you niggas, I mold you niggas
I done told you niggas, that I been owed you niggas
For that shit you did that you wasn't built for
Shit I guess you didn't know you do get killed for
I done filled niggas up with the extended clip
It's like I blew this joint down with the extended rip
Or that non-stop, when the bomb drops
I'ma take it from where you at and then end up on ya moms block
From here to comstock, niggas gettin' bust wild
? Cell cagers last night from lock out just died?
Ain't no where to hide, ain't no wear to run
What more can they do to a man that ain't been done
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
Especially if it's all over the place, your mind all over his face
How do brains taste, when they mixed with gun powder
Semi to fully automatic makes the gun louder
I got som'thin to fix pain when I kicks game
'Cause I'ma float off more tracks than they sixth train
You 'bout to get flamed, from ash to ashes to dirt
You gon' go with the dough that your life was worth
Motherfucker..."

Only saw one.
Those were the times that I was
Under the gun,
It was then I carried you my son.
Led you to safety.
It just wasn't your time to face me. (uh huh)
Ayo a few of them times I thought you would erase me.
But all you did was embrace me.
Prepared me for the worst.
Offered me eternal light,
And scared me with the hearse.
And the curse
Turned to grace.
When the hurt
Turned to faith.
No more runnin', (uh huh)

And if you showed me anything at all

Kept a bad attitude,

Into my lungs when I was born.

What was right,
From what was wrong.
And it was you that let me do
What I knew what could be done.
And it was you that gave me a good wife
And a beautiful son.
And It's been you speakin' to me

First I thank you for the life of everyone that's here with me
Then I thank you for the love you give me, why?
I don't know; I don't deserve it, and it hurts inside
Many a nights I cried, and called your name out loud
But didn't call you when I was doin' good, I was too proud
And STILL you gave me love, I wasn't used to that
Most of the people that gave me love, they ended up takin' it back
That's somethin' new to me, so I'm askin you for time to adjust
Let me make it there, I will be one you can trust
What I stand for, I put my life on, I DO!
I guess what I'm askin is - show me how to stand for you
And I will RAP for you, SING for you, PREACH for you, TEACH for you
REACH for you - I will love you like you love me, unconditionally
And I will ALWAYS be prepared, for whatever the mission'll be
GIVE THE NUTRITION TO ME, and I'll properly digest it
And when I give it back, I'll show you word well invested
And whenever I go, BEFORE I GO, let me give
Thanks to you Lord, my birth, for every day that I've lived

Father thank you for makin' me righteous

Because of that I am blessed and highly favored by you
I am the object of your affection
Your favors surround me as a shield
And the first thing that people come in contact with
+IS+ my favorite shield
Thank you that I have favor with you and man today
All day long, people go out of their way to bless and to help me
I have favor with everyone that I deal with today
Doors that were once closed are now open for me
I receive preferential treatment and I have special privileges
I am God's favorite child
No good thing will he withhold from me
Because of God's favor my enemies cannot triumph over me
I have supernatural increase in promotions
I declare restoration of everything
That the devil has stolen from me
I have honor in the midst of my adversaries
And an increase of assets
Especially in real estate and an expansion of territory
Because I am highly favored by God I experience great victories
Supernatural turn-arounds and miraculous breakthroughs
In the midst of great impossibilities
I receive recognition, prominence and honor
Petitions are granted to me even by unGodly authorities
Policies, rules, regulations and laws
Are changed and reversed on my behalf
I win battles that I don't even have to fight
Because God fights them for me
This is the day, the set time the designated moment
For me to experience the free favors of God
That profusely and lavishly abound on my behalf
In Jesus MIGHTY name we have prayed; Amen, and Amen"
224,The Prayer VI,2006,Year Of The Dog Again (2006),Hip Hop,DMX,"In the name of Jesus
Let us pray
Father please walk with us through the bad times as well as the good
May we be heard and understood from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get a breakthrough however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls that will lay our fears to rest
Cause there is no way we can live for Jesus when we're liven in the flesh
So I pray that you allow our sprits to be born
Go strong move on know right from wrong
Do not love the world or anything in the world and we know what that means
But lessen we know the distance we need to keep away from fire to keep it missing
That doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men respect their ladies
But lately so many of us have gone a stray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please bring us back home and still in us the word witch is our backbone
Which is children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to yet we receive so little
Cause in this time of spiritual warfare we're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the unknowing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise and our prays sincere
Our heads to the sky you will demonist our fears
In Jesus name we have prayed
Amen and Amen"

Make a noise, you turn around and I put one in your dome (BOOM!)
Last thing you saw was chrome and a, flash of light (uh, uh, uh)
I blast him right, nigga, that's yo' ass tonight (C'MON!)
I could put a bomb in your car and watch it explode (BOOM!)
Then make 'em call, tell 'em all they found was a piece of your clothes
And a small piece of your nose and, bone from your arm
Which they really couldn't tell apart, because of the bomb
I could be waitin, camped out in yo' car, in the backseat
With some fuckin' chickenwire, soon as you hit the backstreet
I jump up like Jack-in-the-Box, strangle the shit out yo' ass (BLEH)
Clean up the mess and, get away from the cops
Niggaz won't creep these streets with me
Cause you know fuckin' what these streets'll be
Make you wanna... then I'm gonna...
'Cause I gotta... POP POP, POP POP (nigga!)

Make you wanna... then I'm gonna...
'Cause I gotta... POP POP, POP POP (nigga!)
I could be the UPS delivery boy (uh-huh) or the man
Workin at Toys'R'Us handin yo' kid a brand new toy (true)
I could be the one servin' your food wherever you go to eat at
Or that nigga on the corner that you ask, ""Yo, where the weed at?""
I could be the one drivin' the schoolbus that yo' kids in
Except that, I don't like to involve, women and children (aight)
A nigga got feelings, I just put 'em aside
And when it's time for me to do my job, I just ride
I don't get much sleep (uh) my soul's tormented (uh)
I wish it was a lie but everything I said I meant it
I know I'm doin' wrong and everyday I beg the Lord
To forgive me for fuckin' with the, double-edged sword
Shit ain't goin' too well, BUT THAT'S MY LIFE
I know I'm goin' to hell, BUT THAT'S MY LIFE
Sometimes I think what will I do, WITH MY LIFE
Kill nigga kill this IS MY LIFE
Niggaz won't creep these streets with me
Cause you know fuckin' what these streets'll be
Make you wanna... then I'm gonna...
'Cause I gotta... POP POP, POP POP (nigga!)

We built this Double R thing from the ground up
Another principle of when it's beef, niggaz round up
Gettin' down like what nigga, YO!
That's all it takes and it's like, HERE WE GO!
Thorough type niggaz that control the streets
Rollin' deep, holdin' heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggaz goin' down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out
C'mon fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pitbull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin the line
Hit your sweater, with about ten from the .9
Double R and we get down for life!
Let a nigga KNOW we can go down tonight
From the tops of our heads, the tips of our toes

Black suit be fittin you nigga, I got hood degrees
Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin' man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees
Then it's me against the world, man against machine

Infa-Red nigga, let's go...
All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane
Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggaz a break, nah; I gotta chase mine
Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggaz that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise
But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin rocks the size of Domino pizzas
I'm untouchable, nigga

Hang the Double R chain from the side of the car
Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean 'cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?
Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on
That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you

I spit in your eye like niggaz is eatin, I'm splittin the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I? The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms
Yeah, my block is real, my niggaz is armed

With change of weather, canary in the sun, uh
I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X whattup?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)
We both had bricks they couldn't sniff cause the coke was uncrushable
Guns is fingerprint-proof, we ""Ryde or Die""

But you fear me, and fear is better than respect, y'all niggaz hear me
If I smack the shit outta this nigga, his man over here is like ""Yo""
""What nigga what?"" and his man is like ""Sike yo""
Take it from one extreme to the next
Ynd my shit always bounce like DM to the X
I can bring it from up here, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, down to ""Aight, I think it's safe to take off the cuffs"" play wit words, blurge and splurge, flip styles
Take his and hers, niggas encouraged, I get wild, so don't make me angry
You ain't like me when I'm angry
Got a lot of enemies and they all like to bang
Catch me when I'm sleepin', wit one eye closed, one guy chose, the dogs
One got froze, wit hoes
It's gonna be a long time 'fore they touch this here, it's Gotti, Cartier
Let's take it there, make a milli yeah, which Bentley's
Ice drippin off the jewels

95, December, fine women, illegal tender, such as life, when I feel like
Y'all ain't give me half, who could hold me, hoes try to console me, wreck
They sex, drugged out broke and lonely
Like so many who pushed Rolie before me
Ja hit 'em precisely, God just don't make too many like me inadvertently shittin
On the top 20, y'all niggaz kill me, talkin' like y'all can't be touched, see by the time y'all realized, I done touched you up, blazed you up, your whole style, chump nigga, what? hit it again if you thought I gave a fuck
Yo, yo, yo it's pitiful, everything's political
But I got more rounds now, so all y'all can get a few
You know the shit that we be on, the three on
Must be the money like Deion, now we see on
Player you pop shit, I'd rather pop shells
Twist el's, blow chaps wit the rap cartels
Nigga, one nation in the gutter
L-O-X style, I bring it to your mother
Christ can get iced if he fucks wit my brother
You know who run New York, so bump the undercovers

Honies sellin crack, put this pack on your son
It ain't my fault I want a vault full of money
The shit is dead, I seen a|br> nigga shoot a honey
Now who's to blame when you bleed
Ain't no answer
If it ain't a bullet, I'mma die from cancer, puff out till my lungs is gone
And nigga it's a war till the guns is gone
Giuliani showed me, that hell's another level
Blessed by Allah, possessed by the Devil
Born in this crime I was sworn to do, slayed you fake thugs since performin to, I'mma bleed 2-5 to my dyin' day
Spray the A-K till this world decay
If the Feds wanna stay, we gon make 'em pay
Cursin they whole life till they old and gray
And in the name of the Father, and the Holy Spirit, will they murder me In hell, Crucify my lyrics, only time ever tells
And I know that you feel it all my niggaz in a cell
Yo I'm wit you in spirit, nuttin nice about a nigga
When he Doin' his bids, comin' home to the next man raisin your kids
To my thugs in the Bridge
Hold ya head up, cause niggaz gonna feel it till they cold and dead
Runnin' wit five niggaz, criminal disguised niggaz
The live niggaz, pullin Mac Wha, surprise niggaz
Holdin' my mics to metal light, invitin these water-head
Brothas to get splash back and take a life, slidin back when I was 16
?Rule-mellow? My brother told me laid back, aced up, and play it mellow
Seein how I'm a young Othello
Don't confuse me wit them brothers who lost playin' black DeNiro
The boss of this, get to toss the Crist, robbin shit
We ballin flawlessly
From envy y'all brothas tried but you'll never touch me
The god heated up beyond he frequency

White on whites, menage and dykes, and nice ice
White wraps for these niggaz who scrap and gun clap
Stick up kids, leavin' y'all with two in the back
Once you bitch-made niggaz started doin' the rap
Seven figure shit really started ruinin rap
Take it back to hood shit bulletproof and biscuits
Chips all for hustle and grams go from bricks
And whips for templates, we switch while we movin all of this weight
Till we screamin all of us hate

Nigga respect this, catch me on the block and with gloves
I'm ambidextrous, sold with the glock and the snub
But I ain't reckless, with me it's always one big dot
Then one big shot, and one kid drops
Head shot, closed lid over one big box
And a preacher left prayin' over one big plot
Never a mess, now I wanna conquer the world
And I'ma do it, wanna know how? Fuckin' with Earl

With his guidance, help create a beast from a mutt

Takin' out the residential global persperation
Freaky gyrations close to fornication
Numbers get passed when asked information
Intoxication faded inebriated
Designated driver liver than macgyver
Blockin' freaks in all of 'em tens
Stallions get them to pile in
Sittin' on 'lacs bitch we write raps
Backdo' access you gettin' jealous
Standin' all in line with designer umbrellas
Bad fellas runnin' with the eastside connection

Come on baby we some noisemakers
Catchin' niggas with bricks at am I ? ?

On mad niggas hit lists
But ain't a muthafucka come and get this
Witness what's unheard of cold blooded murder
This hot shit'll have you smellin' like a fuckin' ? ?
And the shell from the twelve is all it takes
To make a nigga spin like twice and then fall
You call for help
But ain't none comin'
The avmen slaughtered the robbery and gun runnin'
And when I'm done gunnin' we all gon' meet up at the club
Fuckin' with cube it's nothin' but love

That this is it? Okay (GRRRRRRRRRR)
How many slugs should I plug into yo' chest before it's get filled
Since you ain't got nuttin else to do but get killed
Been a fiend every since I found out how a slaughter taste
Empty a clip of hollow tips into yo' daughter's face
Cause that's just the type of shit that I'm on
Collect my dough, make the fuckin' hit and I'm gone

Infrared, to your head, will make sure, I hit him in the brain
BLAOW! One mo' time for good luck - for what?!
He was already dead, what the fuck?!
I be, breakin my shit up OFF in a nigga
When I don't see, nuttin but SOFT in a nigga
Fuckin' coward, I wonder how it - feels
To have to look at your moms - squeal, after I hit her with the steel
Ill, that's how a nigga blows shit up
Believe whoever I hit up, will never get up
Tell me, how it's goin' down nigga
If I'm bein a fuckin' clown nigga (yeah)
Take a couple of rounds nigga, I keep a toast real close
In case I gotta turn the rest of yo' peeps into ghosts

Up North I hit my niggaz off with good smoke
Out West they ridin' with me, now I'm back hard
I'm just worried 'bout the rats that's in my back yard
Hated by many, confronted by none
I trust two guys, one's God, and one is my gun
Jada is the nice guy, 'Kiss is the monster

What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Face illest street niggas, illest rap niggas
It's murda!
Motha fuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether your for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother fuckers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you
Yo, shit I hope y'all niggas know to lay low now
Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down
'Cause I hit 'em on sight, its dark dim the lights
You shot twice god bless to this the night
That alot of niggas fear the coming of their life
And you dead right be in hell looking for ice
Fuckin' with Ja you bitch niggas talking shit
All on my dick you broke niggas making me rich
You gonna blaze me cause you high ripped off the henne rock
Flow semi-hot handling me your not
Check my forte not even on a bad day you beat this
Rather beat your dick or your bitch
My flow be the sick shit, gravely ill
Niggas dying 'cause they know I spit like iron, nothing but bark flyin
Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seein my plight
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin' that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin', niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin', I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!
Grrrr...
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so I gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty

I can give it to ya but whatcha gonna do wit it
When I'm in Texas I'm bumpin' screw music
With big mike and scarface and luke loop
Me and lil' crook like bo and luke duke
When I'm in miama I go to scoop luke
To see the peep show and hit the duke shoot
Went to branson, back to back, lex coup
Up in ""harlem world"" in my timb boots
Two suckers had beef so I watched them shoot
Called up benny rat, copped a bullet proof
Seen t-funk he took is to the fruit
Then he went to the tunnell and brought down the roof
Mink coats and moet, bitches drippin sweat
Slang a cassette to funkmaster flex
And now I'm bumpin' on east coast tapedecks
Went from swatch to platinum rolex
S.d., jersey we getting more sex
Flow next
Go next
I say
I can give it to you but whatcha gon do wit it,

If my niggas can't eat then y'all niggaz can't sleep
I just begun to peep nightmare on elm street
Release from jones beach to south beach, capeesh?
Kickin dust as I bust, ... peace
And all them crooked cops on the beat
My niggas bring the funk like your grandpa feet
Till death do us part, save my bullets for the charts
With darts, like hbo watching after dark
No love for a mark, even less for a trick
That wanna be like mike, mike who my ...
Real shit hotness
Run wit my niggas that ain't got shit
Pop shit, and peddle poetry for profit
One time, out for mine, but can't stop it
Trying to keep they hands in my pocket
So I bring obnoxious, infected lah that be toxic
Leave the crop scene spotless
Mix the green with the chocolate, heres the topic
Niggas, synchronize your watches

Y'all ... niggas is duckin me like you owe me something
I got more homies than an esse, but lets say
I couldn't talk you wouldn't walk my way on your best day
The best way you can hope to get close to me
Is right here under my wing like you're supposed to be
The first time you start acting fuckin' strange
Best to be ducking range
Talkin' shit wearing a fuckin' chain
I break niggaz like promises
Split em' open like thomas'
And sell more drugs than a pharmacist
Strapped wit nothing but a rhyme a long history of violent crime
Attitude that doesn't mind doing time

267,Where I Wanna Be,2012,The Weigh In (2012),Hip Hop,DMX,"In the darkest days, the rain that falls
Hear me from the life that calls
And all the things I need to find an answer for
But in the end I know I'll see
The truth in all that I believe
I do what I gotta do
'Cause I know that this, is where I wanna be
Got a lot to say, but don't know who to talk to
Step with a purpose, but don't know where to walk to
Anything I ever said, ever meant something?
I know, because the person I said it to, told me it meant something
My life has a meaning, my life has a purpose
No matter how dark it gets, I knew that it was worth it
Fuck what it looked like on the surface
Seen it all, but not all heard us, like sometimes I was worthless
Can't expect everybody to get what you doing
Can't expect them all to be with what you doing
Don't give a fuck if a motherfucker hating
What you think it is with me, but what's good with you lately
I hate when I sense this shit, trying to make sense of this shit knowing that its sensitive shit
Niggas so dumb, that they don't even sense the shit
You said the shit, so I know you meant the shit you said
In the darkest days, the rain that falls
Hear me from the life that calls
And all the things I need to find an answer for
But in the end I know I'll see
The truth in all that I believe
I do what I gotta do
'Cause I know that this, is where I wanna be
Born with addiction with fast living with high stakes
I race down a highway of life with no breaks
Make no apologies for the risks that I take
And manning up to the repercussions that I face
No silver spoon, I was raised in a crowded room
Rarely seen the sun, faced a lot of gloom
I hit the streets too soon before 21
Working on the clock since and on it until I'm done
I'm never clocking out, but always locking in
I had a warm heart, lost a lot of friends
And losing them make me feel like I was drowning
So please forgive the chill I know you feel when you around me
Dreamed of living right, big family, the picket fence
Grandkids I will get to share my story with
But here I am, living vile as I stand my ground
Just hope it doesn't end, with shots fired, man down
In the darkest days, the rain that falls
Hear me from the life that calls
And all the things I need to find an answer for
But in the end I know I'll see
The truth in all that I believe
I do what I gotta do
'Cause I know that this, is where I wanna be
If I could bottle the inspiration
Id be a billionaire, straight fuckin' villain yeah, X baby you still in there
I feel the air, I can smell the death in it
Y'all be leftin? it so fuck nigga step with it
The walk is easy, the journey ain't worth nothing
That's why every day a nigga wanna hurt something
But, I made progress, more or less
If I can avoid the stress, I can avoid the rest
A nigga stay dealing with the bullshit daily
Niggas is worse than the bitches, y'all hear me?
Straight up and fed up (what!), I'll have you sprayed up and wet up (what!)
Now you laid up and won't get up
Now look at what the fuck you got yourself into
All I did was open the curtains and you jumped out the window
That's what suckers do
You just a punk motherfucker you, got a nigga like motherfucker Ooh!
In the darkest days, the rain that falls
Hear me from the life that calls
And all the things I need to find an answer for
But in the end I know I'll see
The truth in all that I believe
I do what I gotta do
'Cause I know that this, is where I wanna be"

You can try but I do fight, just can't seem to do right
Can't run with the big dogs, those jeans are too tight
I been doin' this for too long, plus dog is too strong
Let you cats, bite me off the map, with a new song
Man you know you wrong, tryin' that shit there
Yeah, a nigga went there, all you did was sit there
I've been rappin' about 20 years and you 20 years old
X is back on the block, lookin' to go gold
There's a new sheriff in town, just been re-elected
You ain't gotta like it but respect it, nigga check it!
I'ma get it in until the nigga wins with the dividends
Cause, we gon' walk the dogs, till the bitter end
You like, ""Oh it's him again!"" I knew that's how you felt
[Sniff] Pussy! I knew that's how you smelled
All you cats do is play around, with your speech
Talkin' 'bout, what you got, ain't air in the teeth
You can, put on a vest but, I'ma still stop ya
'Cause I got a chopper that sound like a helicopter
And niggaz really don't want me to pop the trunk
We gon' either chop or slump when I cock and dump
Whether the Glock or pump, cats ain't ready
Half from here to here, lookin' like spaghetti
Pull out the machete, hack off the limbs
Bag up the pieces, wipe off the Timbs
Jump in the Benz, five cars deep
4 o'clock in the morning, riders still asleep
Shut shit down whenever we hit town
GIVE A NIGGA PASS! I lay my dick down
You can, bring out the best or, bring out the worst
You gon' bring out the worst, we gon' bring out the hearse
Niggaz play poker, I play poke-her
Hit her from ear to ear make her smile like The Joker!"

Every party we do, we gon bring at least ten
Robbery dudes, all make robbery moves
To these dudes, the robbery is food
Nigga don't want to wait, come on dog, pass the plate
How the fuck you gon talk about crew, hold up
Whatever I rep, the whole fuckin' world throw up
Slow up or get put down, shut down
I puttin' my foot down, it is what it is, baby, what now
Whooo, all you cats is builts for nothin' but frontin

Sick, so I carry and I will bury your clique bitch
It's the frontline of X
I'm two-steppin, got my weapon and the extra nine
And you get wet if you over step the line
And oh yeah, call the doctor while I find the vet
You little niggas better eat your vegetables
Get your weight up, be back out to bless y'all
Me and Dark Man got it mapped out
My nick name Hawk Man, don't get your face cut
Countin' scars and gon get your place rushed
From me and my nation, with my gun glow in the dark man

Free is here, my strong man, give up your safe, buck
Yup, so fuck what you heard

And I know you wanna battle, cock back the burner
And I let a nigga have it with the rat-tat-tat
And if I'm askin to battle and

With a shot to the stomach, if his crew got a problem

272,Who Shot Ya (Freestyle),1998,Unleashed & Unreleased (1998),Hip Hop,DMX,"I got blood on my hands and there's no remorse

Yo don't you get the picture niggaz can't touch me
'Cause I don't give a fuck G I'll get you touched B
I got choice ripple my slug'll take apart a door
And enuf crazy niggaz behind me to start a war
So what you want nigga help me is about your best
When I'm finished Red Cross couldn't clean up the mess
And a vest will do nothin' but make you look a little thicker
'Cause in the dark you ain't nothin' but a lil nigga
But if you've been thinkin' about that shit you did
You wouldn't have brought the joint wit you kid
Now I might have to get you kid and split your wig wit a machedi
I bring beef to niggaz and string them out like spaghetti
U ain't ready lord can you stand how I'm bringin' it
I'm givin' it is how I'm livin' it so I'm swingin' it
Red dot on your head 'cause you's in mid range
Red dot on your chest opens up your rib cage
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin' that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin', niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin', I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit! Uh!
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so I gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor

What's good, you got it, I'ma take yours,
I'm hood, f-ck a gun, I break jaws,

And I should 'cause you frontin' bang with the force,
Rats playin' in the walls, cats playin' in the halls,
But n-ggas know after a certain hour stay indoors,
'Cause I'm not responsible for what I might do,
Or what might happen if dog come through
Its gon' be a problem 'cause man if I catch 'em I'ma rob em,
Pleeeease somebody stop em,
But for that it's too late, I gotta eat,

See all of them rinky dink Mr softy rap, I'm here to kill it
Reinstate the boom bang and make you n-ggas feel it
And most these n-ggas fear it.
Let me pop it off and blam it
And how we smash it out like you watching animal planet
Now let the sun load the bricks off
N-ggas pissed off
The stage too crowded throw the bitch off
I'm bout to turrn the switch off, to the goons I hand pick em
And they burrrrrrr stick em, ha ha ha stick 'em (whoa)
You better tuck in your shine, that's prime grind
Niggas is black, them kill 'em in black
Now feel us one time, see how we got 'em following suit
Fall in one line till we force these n-ggas to scatter
Soon as I buss rhyme
Bust Rhymes, constantly fulfilling them with heat
Like an oil spill in the street
See how we killin' em
Peep how we drill 'em in the head with a case load
And bang em

Oh shit
Motherfuck
Hit the motherfucking floor baby c'mon, let's go!
Y'all looking for names, I'm looking for beats
Y'all looking for fame, I live in the streets
Y'all talk the talk, but I walk the walk
School street, home of the brave, New York!
Y'all make movies, but I make moves
Straight up, y'all got something to prove
Y'all niggaz duck, but I swing back
Y'all niggaz run, but I bring gats
Y'all niggaz whisper *X is a crackhead*
Aight fuck it! I'ma just crack heads!
I bang niggaz that cross the line
Y'all niggaz talk shit from way behind
I stand my ground but Y'all niggaz don't
Shit! I go to jail, but y'all niggaz wont
Y'all niggaz walk around and get scared
I don't give a fuck! I DON'T CARE
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the walk
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the walk
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all
Y'all niggaz are pussy, straight up ass
I'll keep that thing, and I'll blast
Letcha man know, he don't wanna push me
Remember, it's you, not me that's pussy!
Y'all niggaz walk right on your tomb
I come through hard, kickin down doors
I spit a mean sixteen without a pause
Then let sixteen go just because
Win it for the dough I'm in it for life
You've been jail, beating your dick
I'm fucking your wife
I'll bring the drama, I'll bring the noise
Kidnap yo momma, bring 'em to the boys
I make shit happen with one word
You take shit laughing nigger, use the bird
I take niggaz for everything they got
That's why I'm the dog and you not!
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the walk
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet

290,You Could Be Blind,2001,The Great Depression (2001),Hip Hop,DMX,"You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
'Cause you gon' be fine when you need to be it
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life
Now if you start with dirt, then you start with hurt
You start with ""Oh, you ain't got?""
Well here, take my shirt
Start with work, blood and tears over the years
Goin' through whatever we go through, we stickin' it out here
Pups turn into dogs, tadpoles into frogs
I'm just eatin' what's in front of me, ain't thinking about yours
But I'ma keep my paws on what's mine
Beg till I find
Strapped till I'm blind
A nigga that whatever I do, still gon' be able to spit this
I'm wit' this, 'cause this is mine, you scared shitless
Rap niggas can't fuck with the dog
Never, could be twenty below outside
I'm built for the weather
It could be hotter than lava, I wouldn't bother to sweat
Some of you niggas, I'm a father, what you startin' to forget
I paid my dues, not only did you not wear
But you would really love it
If you could meet that cat that made my shoes
C'mon!
Now see, what I do is peep shit, keep shit low
Key paying attention to what you trying to show me
Listen, but you never know me listen
Don't give me what you don't owe me
Don't tell me that you love me
Don't talk shit, don't kill me slowly
'Cause a dog like me, is an only
Meaning, hit another like you, truth hurts, but I can't be phony
You always look at bad, look at you mad
But you won't be satisfied till it took what you had
(Aight) I'm a thorough nigga, I keep my word
And anybody that's ever met me, got love for me
So I keep a heard
And that shit y'all niggas told me got me fucked up in the head
Went from, ""Yo, that's my dog""
To, ""get, that nigga dead""
What the fuck is all this?
News to me
Dog it's like shit ain't what it used to be
See some niggas choose to be on the other side of the fence
Keep riding with this, get fried in the mix
C'mon!
Now if it ain't that, then don't say that
'Cause I don't play that, y'all play that
But the poke ain't black, damn, why you say that?
I thought that... what?
Nevermind, I just thought it
We supposed to keep it real
I destroy what I was taught
Misery, love, company
Now you niggas talikin' 'bout jumpin' me, pumpin' me
Full of slugs, blood, stud with the love
Damn, I just gave, what a real, nigga does
Don't listen to the buzz, don't get caught up in the hype
You'll lose everything that you worked for
Trying to take a nigga's stripes
Live life through life, and so on and so on
That's when the grow on, man, get your flow on
You niggas gettin' too old for this kid shit
On the real, we all done did shit to get shit
Snake shit, right is better, wrong is wrong
Mo'herfucker, listen to this song
You see what shit I'm on
C'mon!"
