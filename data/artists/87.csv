And everybody just clap your hands
Ah fly girls, clap your hands

Well if you're feeling all right and you think you're on
Ah-somebody let me know
Well everybody in the place, put a whistle in your face
Scream it out and say *whistle* yooooo, hit it!
You don't stop
A-rock the rhythm that makes your finger pop
I said ah, hip-hop, ah thanks a lot
Ah c'mon everybody gimme whatcha got
I'm gonna tell you a little story about the Sugarhill Gang
(All three) With the pow pow boogie and a big bang bang
And if you wanna rap to the Sugarhill to the beat
Gotta rap in the key of R-A-P
Now that is over I'm ready to jam
Want all you people, to clap your hands
Tonight we're gon-na, scream and shout
We're gonna turn this motha -- sucka out
To all of you people that are ready to jam
Scream it out and say, I am! (I AM!)
Some-body! (SOME-BODY!) Now you know you're hot
Ah see I met this girl and I said to her, ""Honey
If you wanna be my baby you got ta gimme money!""
Turned around, didn't mean no harm
I knocked her out, with my vicious charm
I said, ""No no baby it's not like that
Ya see I'm all about makin' that cold cold cash""
Started jivin around, started messin wit her head
And next thing I know, she wanted to go to *whistle*
But to turn me on, you got to be the best
'Cause I'm the Master G, I don't take no mess
Like T-N-T, I'm dynamite
Ya see I rock your body to the early light
And when you wake up in the morning you'll see I'm gone
And check it out girl, you're all alone
Cause you just been hit by the Capricorn King
I rocked you gentle, I rocked you/me
I rocked you in and I rocked you out
You made me scream but I made you shout *whistle*
Go dang diddy dang di-dang di-dang diggy diggy
Dang diddy dang di-dang di-dang diggy diggy
See it's up my back, it's around my neck
Woo-HAH! Got them all in check
See it's up my back, it's around my neck
Woo-HAH! Got them all in check
Ah let's scream, and let's shout
And let's turn this function out
And keep keep it on, but you don't rush
Ah let's make this party the real Cold Crush
Let's scream, and let's shout
Ah let's turn this function out
And keep keep it on, but you don't quit
Let's make the party the sure *whistle*
Once upon a time not long ago
Everybody had on their radio
And then the fella came on with a groovy noise
To put the wiggle in the women and girls and boys
The word got around about three cool cats
Who put the ?foot?, BACK, in the pack
And let me tell you party people just who we be
With the help of Big Bank and the Master G
So get up

1,Apache,1982,8th Wonder (1982),,The Sugarhill Gang,"Ho! Ho! Ho!
Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Kemosabi, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Apache, jump on it, jump on it, wowowowowowowowowo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga
I'm Big Bank, I am the Chief
I got a lot of raps but I'll be real
I never need a horse I like to chill
So I, drive up in my new Seville
My Tribe went down in the hall of fame
'Cause I'm the one who shot Jesse James
Pound for pound, I will never break down
(Big Bank!) No sir, I don't mess around
Awowowowowowowowowow! Ho!
Wowowowowowwowowowowowowowowowowow!
Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Kemosabi, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Apache, jump on it, jump on it, wowowowowowowowowo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga
Like Kemosabi, of course it's me
I'm better known as the Master G
A firing squad, sensed the danger
When they're stung by the rapping ranger
Had a little talk with my medicine man
He said, ""Get them squaws, fast as you can""
To all you girls, that wanna join my Tribe
Just move to my rhythm, and feel my vibe
Put up a fuss, in the end you'll agree
When you come inside, my tee-pee
As I said before, you could sense the danger
When you're stung by the rapping ranger
When Silver and I, take a route
All you suckers better step aside
I sting squaws, then I run away
HIYOO Silver, is what I say!
Ho! Ho! Wowowowowowowowow!
Hit it gang!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Aowowowowowowowowowowowo!
Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Kemosabi, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Apache, jump on it, jump on it, wowowowowowowowowo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga
A pow-wow, just rock it out
Finger poppin' to the break of dawn
Keep it rockin' like the stuff that we call maize
(What's that?) Hot buttered popcorn
You just hippa-hoppa-dippa-boppa bang the boogie
Woogie betcha wanna boogie again
And you can put me to the test at your request
I rock you out of your mocassin
Kemosabi got down, took off his mask
He kicked off his shoes and did the Monster Mash
Tommy came along, saw what was happenin'
His head began to boppin his foot start to clappin
Go slam, dunk, do the jerk
And with the mic is how my smoke signals work
They were jammin off a record that said it best:
""Now what you hear is not a test!""
Aowowowowowowowowowowowo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga (2X)
Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Kemosabi, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Apache, jump on it, jump on it, wowowowowowowowowo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga
Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Kemosabi, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Custer, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it...
Apache, jump on it, jump on it, wowowowowowowowowo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga"
2,The Lover in You,1983,Rappin' Down Town (1983),,The Sugarhill Gang,"I am the king of the rappin' thing but love is really my game
And when it comes to gettin' the finest chicks
I put all the other rappers to shame
The ladies scream when I'm on the scene
They love my 280-Z and when the party's over they stand in line
To go home with the Master G, ha ha hah

The lover in you, I know she's in there somewhere
This is for the lover in you
Ah, for the lover in you

The lover in you, the lover in you
The lover in you, the lover in you
If there's a party in any town
You know the Sugarhill Gang will throw down
With yours truly, the Master G
And the brothers who rap so sensuously
It's got to be mellow
Got ta be right
We are the original Rapper's Delight
And love, is what we're talkin' about
So c'mon gang, ah, let's take it on out
