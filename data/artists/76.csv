And people come from miles around
With an almost religious devotion
To get on down.
1, 2, 3, 4, get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
What up everybody so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention
Now I wants to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk
When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C
Double O, L, I, O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know
1, 2, 3, it's like A-B-C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's the past

If you got beef, then nigga eat a porkchop
Once I get it goin', you know it don't stop
I brake like antilocks, panties drop,
From hood to hood, block to block
Help, I need somebody
To get it goin' on in this party
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right,
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night
My name ain't Wonder, but I'll rock your world
Get more bounce than a Jheri curl
Too many looky loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on, now whatcha gonna do, so
Grab your partner, do-si-do,
If you don't know who it is, it's Coolio,

But don't step on no toes 'cause you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I been comin' on three like Dr. Dre
Comin' at 'em with a pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip 'cause I don't want to have to get 'em
So move your body baby, drive the homeys crazy,
The way you shake that ass, it always amaze me
Ain't no party like a west coast party
'Cause a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches, then you gotta give a nigga his props
I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to kick the party open

2,2 Minutes & 21 Seconds Of Funk,1997,My Soul (1997),Hip Hop,Coolio,"Yeah yeah
Fuck all these niggaz
You know what I'm talkin' about Wino
Yeah yeah yeah
Two minutes and twenty one seconds of funk
And I ain't no punk
That's right that's right
A tisket a tasket
That's all you ask it
Snap your CD and drop the pieces in your casket
Like little Jack Horna' I'm still bendin' cornas'
Buckin' shots on your block I'm sippin' on Corona's
Uh your McDonald had a farm wit' a six-fo on suicide
Sittin' in the barn wit' no alarm
Straight up collected it, cool and calm
Crowbar in my hand and my skeleton brick still works like a charm
Who's the rawest?
My shit is flawless
Had to be passin' out bruises,
Lacerations and broken jawses
Emcees wanna floss you better understand who's the boss
Before I do a Michael Jackson and ""Cut your shit off!""
Part of the penitentary still, penetratin' your grill
I keep on keepin' it right, while you keep on keepin' it real
I'll bring the treble and the bass to delapatate your waist
Coolio's on the case, get yo hoe out my face, fool
Lodi Dodi, I don't know karate, but I know a razor
And none of y'all can't fade me
I know you wanna try to play me
And busta's wanna playa hate me
I'm one of the dopest niggaz out I
Guess that's why they hate me
'Cause I slang hits like niggaz slang cavi
I remain like khakis, I guess that's why they mad at me
On a record you might outgat me
But you can't outrap me
My shit is fatta'
And yo shit need a little bit mo batta'
Freestyle in unrestricted manner or method
Free funk text readily selected, so check it
Uh, ?dip diver?, socializer, I've been rockin'
These motherfuckin' microphones since nineteen seventy-niner,
And by the time that this little nappy head nigga retire
I'ma be at the ripe ol' age of forty-eight or forty-niner
My shit is wise, CPT M.C. for hire
My name ain't Rick James but I'll burn your ass with a fire
So, what's your desire baby love?
Is it hands wrapped around mics
Or fingers wrapped around triggas?
Eitha' way it go I'm dumpin' and I'm dippin'
Still tennis shoe pimpin', 40 Thevz in position
Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum, now nigga I'm a giant
And yo ass is like Jack,
But yo magic beans is wack
Skills is what you lack
I'm like a Benz, you ain't even like Cadillac
You mo like a Regal
I'ma pit bull, and you's a Beagle
I'm set to strangle hangin' emcee's at all angles
As their legs start to dangle,
Dance around everybody like Mr. Bo Jangles
Los Angeles, Compton, Long Beach, and Carson Hawthorne
Livin' with the Watts
I'm sendin' out shout outs
I used to drink Ol' Gold
Now I just stroll
Straight to the ?exit? section of my neighborhood liquor store
Huh, and you know what make me laugh, bitch?
Even your mama want my autograph, autograph, autograph,
Autograph, autograph"
3,A Thing Goin' On,1995,Gangsta's Paradise (1995),Hip Hop,Coolio,"We meet every single day at the same old place
At the same old time
With the same state of mind
Me and her together but we know it ain't forever
We just happy for the time
The weed and the wine
The walks in the park, escapades in the dark
We knew how it had to be right
From the very start 'cause
I got obligations and she's in the situation
That she came to state, so this is our fate
Holding hands, a smile, a glimpse
A kiss and a dance but we can't take a chance on
Gettin' caught
So we stick to a plan 'cause
We both got another and they wouldn't understand it
Me and Mrs Jones have a thing going on
I wouldn't call it love but it damn sure strong
It ain't about doin' dirt
Or living like a flirt
But what they don't know don't hurt
Me and Mrs Jones
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
The very first time I met her I
Saw her from across the room
And instantly we both became consumed by the thought
Of she and I being together so I
Headed in her direction for some closer inspection
I intentionally brushed her hand her
Skin had a satin texture
The feeling she gave me was
More than I could measure and
Right away I
Knew I had to have her with me
If not with me then maybe just to hit me
She got pin point skill and percision in the walk
And the way that she talk
Make my mouth turn to chalk
She give me everything that I don't get at home
And it seems like I'm a man 'cause her's is always gone, now
Tell me what love got to do with it
No 'cause we both feel good when we kickin' it
Some might say that I'm wrong and I should leave her alone
But me and Mrs Jones got a thang goin' on
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
It's been about a year since we've been seeing eachother
And we're a whole lot more than just part time lovers
'Cause when I got a problem she do everything she can to solve 'em
But her life is not revolved around how revolving
I'm the Shaka Zulu and she's my fantasie, but
Deep down inside we know that we can never be
Any more than what we are, a phone call in the car
Bite to eat, with a movie and a drink at the bar
When all of a sudden right out of the blue my
Ladie got a clue on
What what we was up to and
Wait a minute, damn
From what I understand
It seems that my woman's been talking to her man
Since we both in love with the people at home
It looks like, we just gone have to leave it alone
'Cause I got a woman and she got a man so
That's how it goes, and that's how it is
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
(We had a thang goin')
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones Mrs Jones
(We got a thing going on)
Me and Mrs Mrs Mrs Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones, oh yeah
We used to meet at the same place
Same time
Used to sit and talk it over
(We got a thing going on)
Talk it over
Me and Mrs Jones, Mrs Jones
Mrs Jones Mrs Jones"
4,Aw Here It Goes,2001,Fantastic Voyage: The Greatest Hits (2001),Hip Hop,Coolio,"Aww here it goes
Everybody out there go run and tell
Your homeboys and home girls it's time for Kenan and Kel
They keep you laughing in the afternoon
So, don't touch that dial or leave the room
'Cause they're always into something
It's fun and you don't wanna miss it
It's double K, like 2 the good radius
Kenan and Kel or should I say Kel and Kenan
But you gotta watch Kenan 'cause
Kenan be scheming
With a plan or a plot
To make it to the top
But they kinda in the middle
'Cause they're always gettin' caught
This ain't the Hardy Boys or a Nancy Drew mystery
It's just Kenan and Kel in your vicinity
Like Siegfried and Roy, Stan and Costella
Magic and Kareem or Penn and Teller
Somebody's in trouble
Aww here goes
On Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Nick"

You're lookin' for a way out
Before your game play out

B'cause the new game ain't true game
Well he betta catch her quick
Becuz the old game is runnin'
Nine is his waist
That's the new game loc, 'cause
If you ain't heated then you might get smoked
He was walkin' down the street
Mindin' his business
Just happy to be free
And what do we see?
From the corner of his house
Here come one-time
So off he dashed
Like they set fire to his ass
'Cause if he get caught
It's strike number three
An' this might be his last day on the street
I bet next time you'll listen when I tell ya son

Bueschwa-minded ass house niggas who forget their colour.
Put on a suit and tie and escape from the ghetto and don't never come back.
Yeah motherfucker, you can run but you sure can't hide!
Deep down in the jungle with a crack to the throat
Niggas kill niggas for steppin on their toe
A girl is a bitch and a lady is a ho
When anything goes for a little bit o'docey
Shit get cooked by thugs and crooks
With the knowledge of a scholar but they don't read books
Everyday is a chance that ya life might go
So today is a day that ya gotta get paid
Slang them ki's, make them g's
Do what'cha want but ya sell what'cha please
But don't fuck ??? where you come from
'Cause when you do that you're done
Remember your niggas and bitches and your Trojans
And take it to your pockets for some fitness
When ya get it goin' and ya got it goin' good
Ya better bring back somethin' for da hood
Bring back somethin' fo da hood motherfucker!
Bring back somethin' fo da hood!
Bring back somethin' fo da hood motherfucker!
Bring back somethin' fo da hood!
LA County what's goin' on?
1993 modern day Babylon
Peace to the niggas from the street
And rest in peace to the others that's six feet deep
Welcome to the fool and he strikes when he's back
And the snake come around, go around and get ape
Top down, slipped on CO-run they none

Black cop white cop *gun shot*
Fuck the colour of skin make sure he shot *gun shot*
Escape from a jail cell, split away from hell
And all I want for Christmas is a Glock and some shells
Billy Boy takes the pictures,(?Rak watch the room?)
Five-I-seven on my switch, we got out early
Taddle-tails get dropped an' they get got good
So get this stoob nigga for the hood
Get that nigga fo da hood motherfucker!

Martin Luther King didn't wear a diamond ring
But he had a dream to let freedom reign
My homie Red Foxx got played like blocks
Pick 'em up sticks, jacks and hop-scotch

'Cause niggas need a place to meet, a place to sleep
A place to eat and rest they feet
But nobody really even gives a fuck

7,C U When U Get There,1997,My Soul (1997),Hip Hop,Coolio,"Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinking
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinking
And smokin'
Pretending that your loc'n but you're broken
Let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and
Little Jimmy got life
And Tamika around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy?
'Cause now you done lost a hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a bustler
And though I got love for you
I know I can't trust you
'Cause my crew is rollin' hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters
And just because of that you act you don't like the brother no more
I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin' ta preach
I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared
I'll see you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
More temptation than faith
I guess we livin' for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet
By a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin' lifted
I'm just tryin' to take care of my kids and handle my business
'Cause it's way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster 'cause we got a later start
But I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
And if everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag colour deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the times somebody up there still love us
I'm a scuffle and struggle till I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reachin' sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waitin' wit the sound pumpin'
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
Ah ah etc
You need to loosen up
And live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feel
And for your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that
Too busy tryin' a stack
And keep up with the Jones's taking advantage of your own
The realist homies that you been knowin' for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut to what's right
When it's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous
Yes I know time seems strife
And problems seem endless
But in times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you feel you're out the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in drive and stop by my side
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked or the straight and narrow
We got one push to give and one life to live
So stand up for something or lay down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make your peace
I guess I'll see you when you see me
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there"

We prefer to keep our eyes shut to what's right
When it's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous
Yes I know time seems strife
And problems seem endless
But in times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you feel you're out the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in drive and stop by my side
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked or the straight and narrow
We got one push to give and one life to live
So stand up for something or lay down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make your peace
I guess I'll see you when you see me
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there"
9,Can I Get Down 1X,1997,My Soul (1997),Hip Hop,Coolio,"I'm gettin' bunions from all the disrespectful sisters in my face
I give love
But when push come to shove
I'm 'posed to solo
Diggin me out the ditch
(Hey, hey, Cool, give me some chips, fool) Ain't that a bitch
Ain't no cash just fallin' out the sky
You hella high
But why why did she touch the tie?
But I start on full wit a gangsta limp
Morris couldn't see this pimp
I'm backslappin gimps
True, I'll be in the cut, but you notice me
Try to throw with me
Now you wanna roll with me, fate
I'll lead you left instead of right
Tonight's the night
So, let's get the situation tight
I hear 'em tryin' to playa hate me on the under
My momma said, ""Never let a sucker take you asunder""
Don't be gettin' outta line where it concerns mine
It might be your time, but it's my rhyme
Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah
And nobody wont care?
Can I get down one time without
All the criticism and media in my business?
Can I get down one time and release my rhyme
And speak my mind?
Can I get down one time?
Can I get down one time?
I take my picture with a smile like Jack
'Cause I'm back
You picturin all them chips in stack
I got love, though, don't be no stank hoe
I'm not fallin' for the gank, yo
God I thank, though
Enemies it's your decision
The gift I been givin'
Got you in the life I'm livin'
Watch your sane, sane like Marley Mike
Your game ain't right
You be slippin every night
I'm hoverin up in the nest with the claws out
'Cause he had his paws out
When he paused out
He's out, now it's in with the new
In with the two
You know how these thieves do
Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah
And nobody wont care?
Can I get down one time without
All the criticism and media in my business?
Can I get down one time and release my rhyme
And speak my mind?
Can I get down one time?
Can I get down one time?
I can't do what I want, or how I wanna
This shit is drama
So what is it you want, huh?
We tryin' to make it to the tizzy
I'll be a hella busy bee
The gizzy
Through the frizzy, is we
Tryin' to have somethin'
We goin' off frontin
Cause nothin' leaves nothin'
And nothin' means we head bumpin
Pumpin, no punk can hit this, my stable
Twistin me a fable
Somethin' sweet like sable
You shoulda reached out and grabbed it and got his pay nice
Jealousy got him dropped, with his neck sliced
Liquor be revelain
The homies true feelins
So, I be willin'
To turn into a villain
Then if you're still with me
You got to chill with me
Bustin' lyrics with a skill when they deal with me
Never senseless
Thank you for your business
And I got more rhymes
Than L.A. Times got headlines
Can I get down one time to make the people say yeah
And nobody wont care?

10,Can U Dig It,1997,My Soul (1997),Hip Hop,Coolio,"Uh! Yeah! What Up?
I know y'all wanna take me down
I know y'all wanna see me get clowned
I know y'all wanna take my sound
And put a nigga like me in the lost and found
But I refuse to fade
I'll stay this way
Spreadin venom in the mic till I'm old and gray
And now niggaz wanna attack me
Flip-flop and back me
But fool you's a mackey
I'll starch your ass like some khakis
Your shit is tacky and you better play the backwoods
Me and my crew will use your CD for a hackey sack
Imagine that
And it shouldn't be hard
Cause your style ain't large
And you wanna make all the profits with crowbars
Can you Dig It?
When nothin' can save it
Shock your ass like a phaser
Burn and cut like a laser
Amaze you, with this flava
I run with a pack of tennis shoe playa's
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
The first law of age is called survival
That's why I'm deadly on revival
And it's vital
To my basic instinct
That all wack MC's become extinct
Because we on the brink
Or, should I say the edge
Like a schizsophrenic with seventeen personalities walkin' on a ledge
Then you can't see the black 'cause it's blocked by the blue and the red
U.F.O.'s
And scandalous ass hoes
Waist deep in the shit, it's still smellin' like a rose
And I suppose
You want me to play superstar
And when I see you on the street act like I don't know who you are
So, you can run back and tell that
But I won't do that
So, fool you can chew that
To all sucka MC's you better beware
I been conjurin up forces way back in my lair
And my crew don't scare
And we don't care
We act, we wear, I swear
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
It's the thrilla
Straight outta Compton, not Manilla
Got a chokehold on the mic like I was M.C. Gorilla
Take this to the heart for real a
Don't you ever try to steal a
Like AIDS this shit came like gin a
Might fuck up your liva
Call me Pharoh 'cause I'm floatin bustas up the river
When I deliver
Make your sister and your grandma shiver
Top feelin' steadily rakin up the scrilla
Kickin back in my easy chair sippin on some Henna
?Exol? cause my whole crew is locin
And fools always tryin' to fix shit that ain't broken
I'm down with pixies so you don't wanna see me
So, grab everyone in your crew and disapeer like a genie
Never said I was the best but I ain't the one to be testin
Cross the line and in pieces you'll be destined
Don't stop, get it, get it
'Cause I blow up the spot every time I grab the mic and hit it, hit it
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?
Can you Dig It?

11,Can-o-Corn,1994,It Takes a Thief (1994),Hip Hop,Coolio,"Back in the days when I was a young buck
Stuck like a truck gettin' shit outta luck
Times was rough and I didn't have a plan
I was barely on the edge of my life as a man
It's really fucked up when there's dope in the crib
No food in the kitchen for the motherfuckin kids
That's why a young nigga learned how to steal, see
Shopliftin laid me a whole lotta meals
But I remember days when the cupboard was bare and
Life was unfair but who the fuck cares?
I still hear Momma, what she used to tell me
That you don't get shit in this life for free
And even if I never ever make it to the mountain top
Fuck it!I fight for my hip-hop
Not everybody can relate to what I been through
Even though some front and they try to pretend to
Know about the life of a kid and the strife
Where he has to live in the shadow of a base-pipe
Good goes to bad, bad goes to worse
And pretty soon he's stealin from his own Momma's purse
So clean out ya ears and open up your eyes
I reach out to touch but somebody moved the sky
My stomach is growlin, word is born
'Cause all I had for dinner was a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn, a can-o-corn
All I had for dinner was a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn, a can-o-corn
Before I went to school I had a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn, a can-o-corn
I tried to get full off a can-o-corn
A can-o-corn, a can-o-corn
That's all the fuck that we had in the kitchen
A few years later, I pledge a legions to the set
I'm growin' up but I ain't grown yet
It's funny how the strain in a life filled with pain
Can sometimes leave a bitch stained on the brain
I'm sittin' in the restaurant, guardin my food like a eagle
Pickin' up scraps like a seagull
Waitin on the people at the next table to leave a tip
So I can put it in my pocket
Phoney Easter Bunny, Santa Claus and the stork
We was poor as fuck so we ate a lot of pork
And it ain't no motherfuckin way no how
When it come up I let you bring me down
So I stick to the boots and I'm down with a MAAD group
Of gangstas and hoodlums, but you can call 'em 'scroops'
Give me liberty or give me death
'Cause a man without pride ain't got shit left, huh
And now that I'm older with kids of my own
I put me in the pot where it used to be a bone
Get'cha self together, word is born
'Cause a man can't live on a can-o-corn"

And the whole time I'ma watchin like I'm smokin' me a joint
Job search work the projects whackness
And in a few weeks I'd get my check

Don't ya say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
'Cause you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yeah that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin
Ain't no crippin
Ain't no punk ass niggaz set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black
I wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank, and I know that I can bring ya
If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen
We on a mission
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high
I'm tryin' to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin' in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggaz
I keep on searchin and I keep on lookin'
But niggaz are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45
Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggaz can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worryin everybody's tryin'
Nothing from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by
You better be ready so you can ride
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity slide if you're living in the city it's do or die

Now it's '95 so let me drop a line
This goes out to the young black queens
On the neighborhood scene
Who haven't lost their dream
I know sometimes it seems like it ain't no love
And to get where you go ya got to push an' shove
Around the way girl with hope in your heart
Do his five in the purse an' five in the start
She's the kinda woman ya take home to momma
The only kind you ever let get past the drama
Coolio know that you ain't no ho
And it's time to put you up on a pedestal seat
Queen of the entire universe
And you know how I know that you were put here first
An' to every nigga that dissed ya an' every nigga that hit ya
Accept my apologies for my brothaz...
My... sista...
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
You're all I need...
Princess of the Nile
An' sweet black sexy child
Ooh I like your style, huh
First motha on the planet
I know it's gettin' scary
And all these wannabe pimps is all that ya meet
But ya gotta shake 'em off like fleas an' nigga meat
And use your God-given talents and abilities
No matta where ya from ya get much respect
From the top of your neck to your county check
I see ya waitin' for the bus in the early morn
Brick house with a face like Leena Horne
I ain't no cap to save a ho
But I got your front
An' your side an' your back if that's what ya want
So when it's time to put it down I won't be runnin'
Ya got a dear lil' somethin' like Harriet Tubmanm, huh
No matta what ya do or where ya go
Ya got love from a nigga named Coolio...
My... sista...
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
Give it up for my sistas
You're all I need...
Hernie Dipp got the lips, finga tips, and the hips
Ta make mice outa the crazy-ass Bloodz and Crypts
Make a nigga sing a song all night long
Till his voice is gone
Wit' no music on
You can be a busta on a hardass low
An' should be down wit' your ass when your poor and broke
And um uh
Every time ya need I'll owe ya
Gotta do is make a phone call, 'cause
When ya say 'come' ya know she's on her way
Wit' no hesitance
An' any type of the leg
I talk about my granny
Batana, an' Vanita
Jacki an' Nicole an' Grandy an' Artisha
I gots to give credit where credit is due
An' all credit that is credited is credit to you
I give praise to your wayz
An' for all my day
Apologies much respect to the sons I raise...

But I'm still on a mission to see if I can
Get your attention
Now I want drops some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt AMP. 18s in the trunk
When I'm on the streets ya gotta feel my beats
So throw your hands up if you're down with the C
Double O-L-I-O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party so let a brother know
1-2-3 it's like A-B-C if hip-hop didn't pay
I'd rap for free

Slide Slide but that's the past
I gotta sumpin' brand new for that ass
If ya got beef then fool eat a pork chop
Once I get it goin' ya know it don't stop

Help I need somebody
To get it goin' on in the party
Baby you can do it take your time do it right

Too many lookie-loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on now whatcha gonna do
So grab your partner do-see-do
If you done know who it is it's Coolio
Push, push in the bush
But don't step on the toes 'cause you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I'm in the corner on three like Dr. Dre
Comin' at 'em with a pattern and a fresh pair adams
I hope he don't trip, 'cause
I don't wanna have to gat 'em
So move your body, baby, drive the homies crazy
Then when you sake that ass it's always amazin'
Ain't no party like a west coast party
'Cause a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches
Then ya gotta give a nigga his props

Lived a duck named Donald and his mother was a cluck.
Mickey Mouse wore rags, pants in a sag
Neighborhood kingpin but his brother was a fag.
Donald had beef so mickey couldn't sleep
They was rootin for a while an' it was gettin' kinda deep.
Bugs Bunny had to pops on the east side spot
Nona hid the fie from the mob with a glock.
Goofey was mickey mouse right hand man
When they smoked a stick, they came up with a plan
Called Pixie and Dixie, two killas from Chicago
Gave 'em 5k to eliminate Donald
What they didn't know was donald was a G
Had big time respect from the west to the east
Have your ass a seat and listen to the flow
First chapter in the funky cartoon from the ghetto.
Huey and duey and louie with an uzi,
Shot down mickey mouse man hoe minnie
Everybody now minnie got shot down
And the cop on the case was huckleberry hound
Huckleberry had a deputy by the name of dogg
Eye witness to the crime was Kermit the frog.
Kermit was scared and he wouldn't testify.
Pixie and Dixie jus did a Drive by
On Donald Duck, but they shot and they missed
And now bugs bunny is gettin' kinda pissed,
'Cause they shot but they missed and hit his home boy Elmo.
Bugs sellin drugs on the mother fuckin' corner
Things are lookin' shitty in fuck city
So they called in the feds bettle juice and miss piggy
Niggas from the street know that's how it go
Scene two with the funky cartoon from the ghetto
Now the war is on and Mickey mouse is dead
Quik draw mcgraw took two to the head
Huey and duey, and louie got caught
Now they in a county ready ta sell out.
Pixie and dixie's on the run from the mob
'Cause they tried ta kill donald, when they didn't do the job.
Bugs bunny got popped in a bar gettin' drunk
Pulled a glock on beetle juice, but miss piggy had a pump
Donald got the word that his nephews was snitchin
So Tom and Jerry stuck 'em on they way to the kitchen
Goofey was a punk and everybody knew
Him and huckleberry hound was spotted drinkin' brew
In an alley out back in the corner in the dark
But they both got smoked by jabba jabba shark.
Donald Duck got the whole damn city sawed up.
In a Ghetto Cartoon in a land called Fuck"
28,Hand on My Nutsac,1994,It Takes a Thief (1994),Hip Hop,Coolio,"(I got my) I got my hand on my nutsac burnin 'cross the stage
In a motherfuckin rage like a animal in a cage
I catch wrecks like a junkyard fool (fool)
Fuck around and get'cha holdin' that jar, Cool!
Yep that's me on the motherfuckin mic-a (mic-a)
Nova, happy to strike niggas like a viper
Who rules the step to the rep that I kept
For a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time
I got mor flavour then a truck load of Snickers
Ya punch her by the straps, ya got ta kick her, fuck it!
That's how it go when ya dealin' with a pro-per
Got my hand on the mic and I'm about to let it flow
Coolio locc and I'm down ta blast
Peter Piper picked a paper, pick a pepper's and I jacked his ass
Motherfuckers curse me but they can't hurt me
When I'm doin' dirt, that's why I show no mercy
I flips tha scripts and it's tha dips when I rips
And rock tha fuckin' house for the Bloods and Crips
Danger danger, ol' gangsta gangsta
Droppin' dogs on the ??? ???
40 Thevz and the band witta plan to make some stops
Niggas die on the street but they don't play taps
Or 21 gun salute, there ain't cahoots
My name ain't Alex Haley but I still got roots
I bang bang bang to the air now ya dead
It was a black and white thang but now it's blue and red
This ain't an episode of Batman, it's more'n like a Blackman
Slap yo' ass up and I jacked ya for ya Walkman
Niggas on the top and you don't deserve nothin'
They fightin punks, their rags is fucked, they shouldn't even be bumpin
Suckas play the back 'cause I'm dope when I rap
And my hand's on my motherfuckin nutsac
And it's like that!
It's time for me to step so I'm steppin in deep (deep)
I was born a thief so ya know I'm on the creep
Sucka nigga wanna test me but he can't best me
Buck-buck to the chest and I guess you're death-ly
Now I gotta treat ya like a sucka
'Cause you're soft like butter, you punk motherfucker
C-C-Coolio but you can call me Boo
I drop da shit on ya lyrics 'cause ya rhyme style is doo-doo
Ass, faeces, you don't wanna see me
With a flashlight 'cause I serve dat ass (right, right, right)
Word to the motherfuckin homies and you know you can't hold me
Or throw me... so blow me
How many niggas must I stick
Before you get my d'ift and fully understand not to fuck with this
I never been a stoner, take ya momma home and blown her
One night stand and once again she's a loner
'Cause I won't be played out, strung out, laid out
She only gave it up because she thought I had some crack
And I won't be strayed by a lame ass dame
Keep my dollars in my pockets 'cause I'm hip to ya game
Hoes be acting like they love me but they only wanna fuck me
And suck me but don't touch me
Back up off me hooker 'cause I won't be taken
Go find you another motherfucker you can break it
I gots ta keep playin' these niggas like ping-pong
And hit 'em like King Kong, they singin' the same song
'93 is the year and yes I'm gettin' bigger
Gave a shot to the 121 'cause they my niggas
Scotty B ridin' shotgun, BOOM he got one
Only God knows if he'll catch a hot one
Knick-knack paddy-wack Wino's in the back
And my hand's on my motherfuckin nutsac
And it's like that

And it's like that"

Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange make room, manaical
Monster in the game and I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep comin'
Down like rain You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you
The Monstar again, I'm tellin' you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do my tactics
Is unsportsmanlike conduct You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer - Danger
You're dealin' with official hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger - Jump
With thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk
Uh, Lightning strikes, the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessin' and moves is animated
Once I get to ballin', I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is gettin' money
When clicks get to buggin', I'm snatchin' up their bunnies (Uh!)
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shake you down
This is my planet, I'm bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness? (No doubt - Uh!)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money? Or in it for the love, M.J.?
23 ways to make a pay
Loungin' in the mothership back around my way (Uh!)
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole

Yo, god bless! Pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed ballin', on the fastbreak just like the pony express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game You and your team just need to back off!
Get off my block, gimmie the ball,
I said it's my rock! I'm startin' a line-up by gettin' y'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be? They be the Monstars!
We want it all (want it all!)

31,Homeboy,1997,My Soul (1997),Hip Hop,Coolio,"A homeboy is somebody that got your back
Whether you right or wrong
Somebody that excepts you for what you are
Not what you got on, what you can do for them
If you lucky enough to have some then
You know what I'm talkin' bout
Friends, how many of us have them
And not that many
The chances of meeting someone these days you can trust is skinny
But, it seems there really ain't a damn thing you can do
Cause since the seventies, it seems everybody been rolling with a crew
A team, a gang, a posse, or some type-a click
And if your firm ain't thick
Then your squad becomes vixed
Be extra careful or the ones you call your partna
'Cause what they really is, is a busta out to rob ya
And, be weary of strangers bearing your God and gifts
And a wolf in sheeps clothing
Cause some of y'all ain't knowing
Me and you go back like roaches in the projects
And, we done been through things they still ain't even thought of yet
A good homie is hard to come by
But most times you get done by the ones you trust most
So, I gotta raise a toast
To my tried and tested, and straight up for real dose
Pour yourself some exol, this ones here for you, loc
I don't fly on air, walk on water (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Uh, but, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah)
Thick and thin, nigga
You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy)
If I got a quarter, then you got a dime (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours, nigga
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)
Now I done met a lot of haters in my lifetime
That I would of smoked if I would of had a Tek 9
But, here I stand as a man, and I'm free to say
I'm hella glad that my momma didn't raise me that way
And the homies I grew up with
Locs I threw up with
Is the kind of fools that you don't want to buck with
Why does it seem that the good brothers die
And the evil brothers live
And prosper and multiply
Pass the Hennessey to the left hand side
Want some many dirt for the homies that expired
I hope you rest in peace
And, when it's time for my release
I'll meet you at the crossroads dippin in the low-low
But, until then I'ma keep my rolls slow
My flow on tight, and stay rollin' with the 4-0
This is comin' from the one and only
And like MC Shan said, ""I'll never leave you lonely""
I don't fly on air, walk on water (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah)
Thick and thin, nigga
You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy)
If I got a quarter then you got a dime (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours, nigga
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)
Me and you is like family
And everybody know that we go back to back
And we go toe to toe
Comin' from the west
Where the sets run thick
Where brothers either bang or try to make a grip
I cross my heart and hope to die
I never lie
I run out on mine
Anywhere or anytime
Me and my homies don't get involved with that he say, she say
But, if you've lost you'll receive a ass whippin with your instant replay
Or, deckin like Tekken
So, show some respect when respect is given to you
And, watch out for the forty too
Fake curve
And fools who got the nerve
To pretend that they was down
When last month they wadn't even around
West coast, East coast, and worldwide
My homies in the pen, and my homies that lived and died
I'm still the same little nappy head brother from the eastside
And, you can call me homeboy
I don't fly on air or walk on water (Or walk on water, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah)
Thick and thin, nigga
You can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy)
If I got a quarter then you got a dime
(If I got a quarter then you got a dime)
And, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you watch my back, then I'll watch yours
(Watch my back, then I'll watch yours, yours)
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)
I don't fly on air, walk on water (Iiii, don't walk on water, no)
You can count on me till the end (Count on me till the end, oh-yeah)
Thick and thin (Thick and thin)
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)
If I got a quarter then you got a dime
(If I got a quarter then you got a dime)
And, you can call me up no matter what the time
(Call me up no matter what the time)
If you (If you)
(Watch my back, I'll watch yours, yours)
You can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)
(You can call me homeboy, boy, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(I got your back, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(You can call me homeboy)
(You can call me homeboy)"

34,I Remember,1994,It Takes a Thief (1994),Hip Hop,Coolio,"When I was a kid I rolled crates on a skate
And I ate everything mama put on my plate
Niggas walked around packin' BB guns
Knock on your door and run, just for fun
We went to the store and sold bottles for a nickel
??? Bag of Cheetohs and a pickle
You could get a soda for less than a quarter
And people used to speak even if they didn't know ya
We fought in the streets like little black soldiers
Shake hands and still be friends when it was over
We used to play tag or hide and go seek
Or hide and go get 'em if we had a few freaks
But now things change, kids ain't the same
The beg and sleg and try to blow our brains
I wish I could go back but wishin' is fo' suckas
Life was so simple then
I remember (I remember)
Oh, when we used to hang, on the porch
Drinkin' brew and then the drive by (baby)
I remember (I remember)
When we used to play shoot 'em ups,
Up and down and the gang bang (baby)
Well I remember yester year like it was yesterday
Runnin' through the streets of Vanessa, PA
I'll take you through me childhood step by step
Daddy always told me to retain my rep, though
Daddy was a dog and he don't raise no punks
In the midst of the trees we learned how to pump
At the tender age of nine mama put us on a plane
Next stop (the land of the insane)
Compton, California where the killas grow
Forced to live a life that I didn't know.
Wore the wrong colors 'cause I didn't know the facts
Caught a, caught a case, caught a slug in my back
But I had time to quickly, suckas try and get me
But now the fools be a runnin' 'cause this is Drive-By Billy
Little black boy from the east, forced to be a killer
But I can still remember
I remember (I remember)
Oh, when we used to play dominos (dominos)
On the porch and then the drive by (baby)
I remember (I remember)
When we used to have army fights
In the smoke and then the gang bang (baby)
Back when I was a kid
We used to have this game called paper ball
(Paper ball? What the fuck is that?)
Get a piece of paper, ball that mother fucker up,
Play with it
I got the alcoholic juice-ah to wake you up like a rooster
Back when I was young, I used to be a booster
Stealin' candy from the store
Go to school, I had the whole playground
Chewin on my gumma
You know what I'm sayin'? Playin' steel to the chest
And I was the best playin' kickball at recess
I used to play pop-gun, go the Bears and make fun of losers
We used to hop corners on the fresh beef cruisers
Playin' Galaga, Space Invaders, eatin' Reese's
I had all the women cause my tough skin has creases.
And it's been that way since day one
Girls of the world ain't nothin' but fun
I used to watch Dr. J, come through with a touch
Remember New Zoo Review and Starsky and Hutch
I remember lunch time we used to rhyme out loud
Peace to the whop in the hip-hop crowd
I remember
I remember (I remember)
Oh, when we used to hang, on the porch
Drinkin' brew and then the drive by (baby)
I remember (I remember)
When we used to play shoot 'em ups,
Up and down and the gang bang (baby)
Oh now, now now
I know you do
I remember yesterday (oh I remember when we play)
I remember yesterday, oh
I remember how, when we used to play (I remember)
I remember when we, I remember

I used to play pop-gun, go the Bears and make fun of losers
We used to hop corners on the fresh beef cruisers
Playin' Galaga, Space Invaders, eatin' Reese's
I had all the women cause my tough skin has creases.
And it's been that way since day one
Girls of the world ain't nothin' but fun
I used to watch Dr. J, come through with a touch
Remember New Zoo Review and Starsky and Hutch
I remember lunch time we used to rhyme out loud
Peace to the whop in the hip-hop crowd
I remember
I remember (I remember)
Oh, when we used to hang, on the porch
Drinkin' brew and then the drive by (baby)
I remember (I remember)
When we used to play shoot 'em ups,
Up and down and the gang bang (baby)
Oh now, now now
I know you do
I remember yesterday (oh I remember when we play)
I remember yesterday, oh
I remember how, when we used to play (I remember)
I remember when we, I remember
(Used to play dominos, all night long, dominos, all night long.)
I remember yesterday
Do you remember yesterday? (I remember yesterday)"

37,Intro,1997,My Soul (1997),Hip Hop,Coolio,"A man is heard running and breathing fast
Damn! Wha...
The running gets faster, the man is breathing faster, and he sounds terrified. The devil's laughing is getting much louder
There is the sound of things being knocked over as if the man is trying to hide and everything is in his way

38,Is This Me?,1995,Gangsta's Paradise (1995),Hip Hop,Coolio,"Yeah 1996
Coolio with the flow
Rated R superstar
LV that's right
Mossberg Smith and Wesson
Forty-five let me tell you how I learned my lesson
House party in the hood at some niggas I don't know
But I had to go they had a house full of hos
I stepped into that party with my nigga high off that head
The hos is looking good so we try to make a friend for night
Let's get it right let's get it straight
But now these punkass niggas in the party want to play a hate
I'd bust a cap to save a rat so what's up with that
It's 1996 so these bustas get no kinda of doubt
Like American Express here we go again
I never leave home without it so don't even think about it
Just let me leave and I won't have to make you bleed
But if you make an offensive move then I'm gonna have to show a groove
Back up off let's keep it soft
Don't make me have to show you who these 16 bosses be
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
Way back in the days we dudes don't forget a name
Now everybody wants the fame but things change ain't the same
All these sucker set-trippin' killin' for no reason
That's why I never leave the house without my nina
I love my baby carry my baby wherever I go
For these suckers get in a twist they say I beat their pimpin'
Stop wishin you was in my shoes
And learn to be yourself stop acting like somebody else
It's ninety-six and most of the homeys thinking of six feet
The six I found out if you wear partners where the friends go
Every week you don't see me I gotta put at work
I guess the shit don't stop till my gaskets drop
Stop hating my life and get your own
Be true to this game or this game will do you cold
Everywhere I go I got my back
I hate to do my all black but I must stay strapped
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
No no ooh I can't escape this life
I been trying to live in piece but these fools won't cease
They insist with their bullshit so I got a full clip
Chitty-chitty bang-bang doin' it's a new thing
One shot from a Jake .38 can make your brain ache
I'm the kinda nigga that don't believe in frontin'
But if you run up on me trippin' you best believe I'm dumpin'
I got bills to pay and kids to raise
And a whole generation of lost niggas to save
So I ain't got time for that yip yap
If you start some static I'm gonna have to blow your mind back
Believe that nigga daisy if you do it's true
Fuck with Coo you get done that's how we do it to it
Don't start no shit and it won't be none son
But if you do I'm going for my gun
Like Doc Holliday a nigga ain't scary
So if you want to trip then I'll be your huckleberry
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really ain't me no more
These streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside
This really really really ain't me
But the streets won't let me go
I can't escape this life
That they got me trapped inside"

Suction cup, window up
Now I'm on the inside lookin' for some loot

Steel tote boots, black khaki suit
A real quick search and nobody's home
Just like I planned, now I'm home alone
I hope ya don't mind if I use tha phone
And fix me sometin to eat before I'm gone
I got the servant and the china, deuce-five and the 9
Rolex off the desk so I can tell the time
No one knows where the flow goes when the 'dults crow
You better take some no doughs
Now I'm out tha back with a sack fulla goods
Throw it in the truck, take it back to the hood
Let me be brief, I'm on the creep
I stole the sounds out'cha jeep, it takes a thief
Oh yeah! It takes a thief

It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief
Keep both eyes open when you go to sleep
Oh yeah! It takes a thief

I need a lick real quick-like
My mind ain't wrapped tight

You don't wanna see me comin' down the street when I'm broke and it's dark
So run your motherfuckin pockets 'fore they find your ass dead in the park
Put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers
No I ain't the cops, I just want your rings
And your wallet and your watch and your fat gold chain
Don't try nuttin strange or I'm blowin' out'cha brains
I rob from the rich so I can get rich
I ain't got shit so I take what I can get
I need my mail, my snaps, my dollars, my ends
My grip ain't high enough so I'm robbin on my friends
Somebody out there's out to get me
The smaller the nigga, the bigger the gat be
I don't give a fuck about your pain and your grief

Keep ya hand on your gun when I'm on the creep
There's a buster on the West Side, I heard he gotta grip
And he's outta town on business so I'm schemin on his shit
I heard he got kis and Gs and deeds
And guns and big trash bags full o' weed
I stole a brand new fresh shaft telephone van
So now I guess I'm the telephone man
The bathroom window ain't got no alarm
I gotta skelton brick that works like a charm
It didn't take long to find what I was lookin' for
I was damned near finished when I heard a key in the door
I jumped in the closet and checked my clip
Pulled my ski mask down, I can't believe this shit
I counted to five and the front door opened up
I counted three more and the front door was shut
I counted five more to give me some space
Then I jumped out the closet and bucked him in the face
I loaded up the van in broad daylight
'Cause Looky Lou's have their high beams on at night
I take the backstreets to avoid the heat
And never let 'em see me sweat, it takes a thief
Oh yeah! It takes a thief
Yeah yeah! It takes a thief
It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief
Keep both eyes open when you go to sleep
Oh yeah! It takes a thief
Yeah, yeah! It takes a thief
It takes a motherfuckin thief! It takes a thief
Keep ya hand on your gun when I'm on the creep
Oh yeah!

There's motherfuckers out there that want your shit
So you better watch out, better watch your back
Can't be goin' to sleep, protect your shit

Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball
Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk
Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball
I'm sittin' at the bar with a hundred dollar bill
The homies is runnin' late so I got some time to kill
I'm peepin' out this freak in the booth in the corner
I think I seen her rollin' a Noble, nosin under and moanin
Two hookers walked in and they was lookin' for a vic
But they, kept on passin' me by 'cause they can recognize a trick
Twenty minutes later and two double shots of yak
I take a look up at the clock, now where the FUCK the homies at
I feel my pagers on my hipbone, who could it be
'Cause I done talked to everybody that I was 'sposed to see
Hahaa! Now I know, the story is told
And I don't even call 'em back 'cause they don't know the homie cold
I received a page my niggers from the phone in the back
I got a wink from a fine ass sista dressed in black
Another double shout of yak and now the room is spinnin'
But that's only the beginning, god damn!
Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk
Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball
I take a walk out to the front to get myself some air and
See if I see the homies, but they still ain't there
There's a fool outside drunk and he want to get into it
I was strapped I coulda killed him, but I didn't do it
I opted for the walk-away, watch the busta talk away
So mister policeman, you can put your chalk away
I mobb back in the club, and, kick it at my table
Cause, niggaz be acting stupid, and stupid shit is fatal
The homies is hella late, and now I'm startin' to think
Homegirl that gave me the wink from earlier just bought me a drink
She's sittin' at a stool at the other side of the bar
Doing tricks with her tongue and a cherry like a porno star
The club is gettin' packed and the party is jumpin'
Another double shot of yak and I'm on the dancefloor bumpin'
She's licking in my ear and, now I'm feeling faded
It's 11:35 and the homies still ain't made it
Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk
Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball
Now I'm on the dance floor with baby and, shit is gettin' hectic
The big homey done erected, damn I've been affected
By the funk in the boom and the booty in the room
This ain't the Commodores but this Brick House got me on zoom
Now I'm mackin and struttin and asking baby wassup
My name ain't Everlast, but I can still make you jump
Let's, hope in the Q and go somewhere and kick it like some Trojans
We can do a little drinkin', and do a little smoking
When all of a sudden I start sweatin', my stomach starts bubblin'
I hear earl coming, I think I'm in trouble *vomit sounds*
Ah shit, I got baby on her titties
I guess there go my chances of gettin' with her kitty
I turn around and stumble away and there go the homies with
Long ass trenchcoats on, laughing, sippin on 40's
Now I'm in the back of my own car curled up like a punk
'Cause I got too high and uh, got too drunk
Got kinda high and uh kinda drunk
Beer drinkin', beer-beer drinkin', eight ball

41,Knight Fall,1997,My Soul (1997),Hip Hop,Coolio,"When night falls over the city
Gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin' to get me
It's ten o'clock and darkness covers my area
And every night it's gettin' a little bit more scarier
The eleven o'clock Monday news is mo like a horror flick
People sure have changed, it seems that they enjoying this
Death and destruction
With no instruction
Leads to malfunction, disruption, and full consumption
How can I escape this mind state that I'm in?
I been tryin', but it seems that I can't win
I've fallen and I can't get up
And the homies that was my homies went and set me up
Somebody tried to tell me that it was all in my brain
I tried to act a hard male runnin' cocaine
But it still don't ease my pain
Am I insane or a victim of my own fears?
What's goin' on we supposed to be happy here
God don't make no junk that's what I been told
But it seems to me that God ain't in control
When night falls over the city (When the night falls)
Gotta be ready cause it feels like (Feels like somebody)
Somebody's comin' to get me (When the night falls)
When night falls over the city (When the night falls, Ooh-yeah)
I gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin' to get me (Comin' to get me)
I need assistance, but all I get is resistance
I try to be persistent, but life can be gone in an instant
I'm scared to turn around 'cause I know somebody's watching
I can feel they evil stares, and I know that they plottin on me
And scheamin, I wish I was dreamin'
If my mind was free I could chase away the demons
But in ain't, and they still can't understand that
All I ever wanted in life was a chance to be a man
The same old pattern has got me goin' crazy, loc
Descendent of a king, but I feel like a royal joke
Is this a sequel?
Are all men created equal?
The lies you told to the people back then now they is lethal
And now we swimmin in a pool like shark bait (Like shark bait!)
Feel my pulse race, abnormal heart rate (Heart rate!)
And now I'm startin to feel like I might come up missin'
I tried to tell somebody but nobody wouldn't listen
When night falls (When the night falls) over the city (Over the city)
Gotta be ready cause it feels like
Somebody's comin' to get me (Comin' to get me)
When night falls (When the night falls, yeah) over the city

Somebody's comin' to get me (Comin')
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm feelin' oppressed, this stifle
My life is trifle
No family, friends, or relations, so I sleep with my rifle
And my pistol, I'm seein stars and hearin whistles
One shot from a little junky ass twenty-two will tear a whole in your gristle
Wont stay to state side
Cause the unpure fall off the fall by the way side
So stay your ass on the plate side
There's nothin' to fear but the fear itself
And if you control the fear then the fear is wealth
Do I have power or do I have no self control?
These long, lonely nights have made my heart grow cold
Hear my pleads, can somebody help a G
And, will we fight this battle for eternity
I blame you cause my mind is not my own
So, don't blame me if I trespass in yo zone
I'm your creation
The product of a twisted nation
Guess this is what you're facin (Facin!)

Somebody's comin' to get me
When night falls (When the night falls) over the city (Over!)
Gotta be ready cause it feels like

You in the ring with a thing, not a man
And what I bring is shots to the body
That'll make a fool sing, soprano
Fall setter, ain't nuttin better
Massive concussion, career over, no discussion
Both eyes closed, broke nose, cheeks swole
You can't see, vision like a peep ho
This ain't no slug-fest or exhibition
It's a disaster, cold, beat-down, tragic massacre
Call in the doctor
He's been rocked and socked-up
Call the police, the champ's insane and oughta be locked up
Pay-per-viewers have to try to not to light the whole block up
He's hurt and he's wobbling and he can't keep his things up
He's gettin' banged up
Uppercuts, overhead right, short left jab
Right into a change up
Big thing, he's down and canvas smell like dirt, don't it?
El Cool Magnifico crush all weak opponents

These combinations are taking me places
Knockin' my opponents outa they shoes
With tight laces
Makin' faces as they body hit the canvas in pain
The championship belt is what I taste and claim
Survivin the game
Pound for pound you got the best man standing right here
Round for round I got the cowards runnin' in fear
Town for town, fight fans stand and cheer

Another Saturday night I'm feeling kind of smoky
I'm down with the phoney but I don't want no phobia
Eventhough I'm tursty and lonely at least I come up with ""speak this""
But not up on my stomach I wanna doctor generic
I can't tell a lie, something on her eye, what a surprise
I called up the homies said let's go to the spot
Where the drinks ain't too cold and the girls ain't too hot
Now we're in the house but the house is kind of empty
Rax is running 'round the room, but wait I smoke too soon oh damn
Look what just walked in, pimps in ribbs it smells like them
Baby you look good with that cute dress on
Maybe someday me and you could be as one
Let's get to know eachother better
I can sing you a song and you can write me a love letter
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
You can do it baby baby
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
You can do it baby baby
Damn I'm feeling frisky, come and sit down with me
Conversation 'bout little hanky spanky and dranky wanky
Tell me about your inner thoughts, most needs and decides
And I tell you about mine, we can spend some quality time
You roll a man with the vision and the frame
Now listen in this mission I can hit the dirty dash
With thirtysix in my missile, but I just wanna bang little faster
How could you mama, have love for our daddy, any time at home
We're on the turcy bacon and riding in the benz
My name is on your named label now I am the man
I'm the doc then you can play the nurse
But we gotta have patients even though we have no anxiety
But they can show us the disease go off then
'Cause love don't come around here too often
So take my number and we get together later
And I take yours, all the numbers call me a raider
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
You can do it baby baby
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
You can do it baby baby
A few months with four more calls and some dinners
Moon late nights, go to bed and automatic love spinners
Top down in the watchin' wild Californian sunset
And when we zoom, what up, why don't you respect that we need it
So we use it 'cause our relationships is heated
Not above you, you know what I meaning
They started go with some kisses and some touches
Few more priests 'cause we don't wanna rush you
They say I'm fast sinner, no rasism
I'm a witness 'cause we all witness we all take the study cases
Hand in hand, what man to man
I know everything about her and she know everything about me
And we made love for the first time in a bad way
In a perfect state of mind
It's a whole lot more than your having smoked the grind
You better get yours 'cause I got mine
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
You can do it baby baby
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
You can do it baby baby
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
You can do it baby baby

44,Life,2001,Coolio.com (2001),Hip Hop,Coolio,"Intro: yo, I'm gonna talk to you about life for a minute (coolio)
Verse 1: I'm going to a chain 'cause it ain't the same
I remain no geak, life's just to play the game
Trying to brake this chain off my brain so I can gangsta change
Swinging with your things out without a name
A stranger is too much too beat but I ain't scared
I pray to god, hope he won't send me to the devils land
I hope that's not in heaven, trying to get my stand out
Hope my hopes and dreams don't burn in flames, but I'm aware
A life ain't promised, trying to avoid the drama
And live up the expectations for my dear old mama
Inside there's also a fool, inside the court building
Make a million maybe a billion we can save for our childeren
Face to face we trying to escape that but it's too late
So I grab the world and hope I don't have to wait, to get my strike
I've seen the life and all the pain and suffer
So I put my name in the book
Chorus: life x4 (what life) that's life life life (that's life)
Verse 2: ok now, here's the situation
I was raised in a good nation and given a formal education
My brothers and me lived in a fucked up area
Where the innocent life is shitty, lot of grey steam, it's a pitty
When you look over the steam you can miss me
Go ahead and talk but if you diss me
They have to come and get me
They wanna pimp me from my sin
Pretend they're down but they're against me
Think I touch everyone's heart until it's empty
Take my chance as a possibility, no touchdown for a century
Regreting me, feeling me, that's why I'm waiting in the bushes
If I don't than I delicate this to all pussies
Put yourself in my position, you don't know what you listen
In these conditions most likely a body comes up missing
When the lights come off, when you run away like mice
Than think twice if you don't hear your name from the book
Chorus: life x4 (what life) that's life life life (that's life)
Verse 3: can you handle friends, no my life is driving me insane
But I'm a man, so I remain steady, cought up in the game
Make a deal with dicky jane for a little change
Run from your home, banging with your things out
Tripping on everybody, cousin get your thing out, we're ready to roll
When it comes to, show no fear when they hunt you
If you have to use gun foo, they ask for the one-two
Everything but the kids n'sync, act quickly don't think
Don't sink to the level then you gonna leave with the devil
Be quick in the race and try to keep a straight face
And just when there's a new song I feel like I don't belong in this place
Hip hop is my profession, so I gotta keep on guessing
Make it black and white lack another in my session
Coming from the west, microphone is my blessing
So I'm testing, check it, I'm talking about life, that life
Chorus x2: life x4 (what life) that's life life life (that's life)
Outro: I'm just trying to live my life, you try to live your life
You want me to smack your face, give me my space
It's all about style, I know you got style, life is all about it
Nothing lives without life, my life, your life, coast to coast life"

Tell my kids that I love 'em but don't tell 'em that I'm through
Keep cryin and tell 'em I'll be home soon
Oh baby I'm goin' crazy
'Cause I keep seein shit that amaze me
Still I had to kill a motherfucker last week
He thought I was a punk and tried to creep up on me in my sleep
I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch or buck ya
But I can't, so fuck it
I'ma behind these bars and it's burnin like nitro
I might go psycho, the man on the tower got a rifle
Aw shit, there the lights go...

Mama, I'm in love wit a gangsta and I know he's a killer
But I love dat nigga
Hey ba-by
What's happenin' honey?
How you doin'?
I miss you
The kids keep askin where's their papa?
I had to tell 'em daddy got caught by the coppers
It's time for me to raise 'em up proper by myself
It's a goddamn struggle when a bitch ain't got no help
Now everybody tellin' me that you ain't shit black
And when you get out, you'll jack and probably go right the fuck back
Damn, the pressure's gettin' hot and heavy
And yeah, I'm gettin' sweated by your homey in the blue and white Chevy
But now he's got a condo and a brand new Lexus
Wants me to take a trip with him down to Texas
The ends don't justify the means
And in another life he might've been the man of my dreams
But you know I got your back to the motherfuckin end
But a bitch can't even trip like she doen't have a friend

Coolio!
(If you choose to accept this call please press 5 now)
What the fuck you mean you need a friend?
I can't be havin' no niggas round my kids
Don't you make me break up outta this motherfucker
And start killin' motherfuckers, SHIT!
I know it's rough, I know it's tough
But when you fumble in the game sometimes you get locked up
You better stay away punk ass bitch, he ain't shit
I don't wanna have to kill him
'Cause think about the times that we used to have
Don't make me reach out and touch that ass
You put yourself in danger when you fuck with a buster
Like shootin dice without a pistol in a circle of murderers
You got more class than the average-type hooker bitch
Don't switch, he gotta grip but he ain't rich
Now I gotta check but if you've got the cheque
Give a nigga a look and put somethin' on my books

Aiyo remember the homey with the Lexus, he took the trip to Texas
Now he's wearin the fuckin' Lexus like a necklace
So tell me, what's the drill, baby pa? What's a bitch to do?
My nigga's stretched in the pen since '92
Them visits ain't doin' the trick, drop fucks make me sick
'Cause this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip
And that motherfucker representin you, I think he resents you
He got evidence he never presents to
The people in court, I heard witnesses abortin
What's he doin' about gettin' you out to hold the fort?
I got some ends, I'ma send you a dime and two doves
Mama hates you but damn I got love for a gangsta

I'm sittin' in my motherfuckin cell, it's the same song
Tell my kids that I love 'em but don't tell 'em that I'm through
Keep cryin and tell 'em I'll be home soon
Oh baby I'm goin' crazy
'Cause I keep seein shit that amaze me
Still I had to kill a motherfucker last week
He thought I was a punk and tried to creep up on me in my sleep
I just think that I could hold or squeeze or touch or buck ya
But I can't, so fuck it

What's happenin' honey?
How you doin'?
I miss you
The kids keep askin where's their papa?
I had to tell 'em daddy got caught by the coppers
It's time for me to raise 'em up proper by myself
It's a goddamn struggle when a bitch ain't got no help
Now everybody tellin' me that you ain't shit black
And when you get out, you'll jack and probably go right the fuck back
Damn, the pressure's gettin' hot and heavy
And yeah, I'm gettin' sweated by your homey in the blue and white Chevy

A pair of raggedly ass ProWings on my feet
Ten dollars in my pocket and now I'm on the creep
To the double-up spot 'cause the shit is comin' cheap
It's 1984 and the rocks is all fat
Southern California, LA is where it's at
I'm smokin' like a motherfuckin choo-choo train
Big cocaine inside my brain, ah
But nobody knows that I'm on the hype
Use to be in CREAM, well now I hit the pipe
Face sucked in, yellow tooth grin
No bitches, no friends, no ends to spend
I'm stuck like a rat in a sticky ass trap
And I sold everything but my motherfuckin gat
I got a habit like a rabbit and I wanna stop it
But I can't 'cause I'm locked 'n' da closet
Oh make me wanna holler, right into my life
Oh make me wanna holler, right into my life
Oh make me wanna holler, right into my life
Listen homey
No rehabilitation, no wantin to talk to...
Doin' crimes on every fuckin' place I can walk to
I still get props in the hood when I stroll by
'Cause niggas don't know that I'm smokin' like Popeye
Mama's in the kitchen cookin rice
Daddy's in the pen doin' life
Sister gotta husband, she's a wife
And I'm in the backyard hittin the pipe
It's been three or four months since I started usin'
It's a uphill battle and now I know I'm losin
I go to the spots where my face ain't familiar
And I cook here jack 'cause I don't know these niggas
I'm livin' like a peasant and it ain't pleasant
I think I need to change my direction
I got the five dollar piece now I'm all in the carpet
In the dark 'cause I'm locked 'n' da closet
Someone's knockin' at the door, somebody's ringin' a bell
Somebody's locked 'n' da closet, somebody's goin' to hell
Do me a favour, open the door and let 'em have it
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah
One year done passed and now I'm lookin' dusty
Disgusted because my own mama don't trust me
My sister's on the trip 'cause she knows I'm on the hit
And I can't take this shit
There's a rumour goin' round that I'm puffin heavily
And my neighbours is lookin' at me crazy, G
I guess they figured out that I broke in they house
And stole all they shit while they was out
My sister told my aunt and my aunt told Pam
And Pam let it slip to that bitch Roxanne
Roxanne told Bill and Bill told Duke
Now the whole hood knows that I play the flute
But before I lost my respect
I didda lick your dumb ass on a jet, SHIT!
Now I'm back to life, yeah I'm back to reality
Ain't no side effects or technicalities
There's one thing about it when your life is fucked
At the bottom the only way to go is up, ah
No more cocaine bitches
I kick the door off the motherfuckin hinges
I'm out the closet *screaming*
Someone's knockin' at the door, somebody's ringin' a bell
Somebody's locked 'n' da closet, somebody's goin' to hell
Do me a favour, open the door and let 'em have it
Let 'em have it
Someone's knockin' at the door, somebody's ringin' a bell
Somebody's locked 'n' da closet, somebody's goin' to hell

50,Nature Of Business,1997,My Soul (1997),Hip Hop,Coolio,"It's the roll of the dice
That you can't afford to lose
It's the nature of the business
It's the smugglers who lose
I got a little proposition, homey, check it out, we gonna put it down
Cause you and I go way back, and I know you done been around
These peeps that I know done put me up on some shit
Nigga, we could all come up loc, we could all make grips
Now I ain't talkin' 'bout no bullshit ass flippin z's
I'm talkin' Trump type access, they comin' off a gang of keys
Now what exscuse you got to play?
You got a wife and baby on the way?
Well, that makes it mo better
We gon work this shit together
We gonna stack enough loochie to get your girls gift from Gucci
And send your baby to college and ain't no gettin' caught
'Cause we gon use the type of knowledge that they never tripped off of befo
They ain't even ready for this hellified shit we got in sto (That's right)
And I done used the G to hook up that manpower
Shit have the okay to folks taught Pillsbury how to push flour
Now all we gotta do is make sure this shit go through, partna (Right)
Now call your crew, 'cause we got work to do
It's a fifty-fifty chance that you can get stuck
And then snake eyes are crafted, and we shit outta luck
It's the roll of the dice
That you can't afford to lose
But if we make this shit work the whole crew gon come up
With thousands in the Seiko's, Dane's, and fat pocketbooks.
It's the nature of the business
It's the smugglers who lose
Next level in the game, homey, it's time to get this shit movin
We went up fifty keys on ?speck? and now we got some shit to prove it (Right)
We got the contacts in Vegas that's where we go got our troops
They'll be the ones in the casino lines dressed in blue suits
And afta Shorty, Vic, and Spider done picked up the shit
They gon lay low a few days to make the trip look legit (That's right)
But, just in case them niggaz get any fucked up ideas
We gon send Wino and Big Homie to watch our back with the gear (Right)
And then them niggaz gonna take the midnight train to Dallas (Dallas)
We got to hook up them baggage plans to Ras Kass, Misses Alice
The cool thing about her is that if she get caught
It's still all in the family so she ain't gonna sell a nigga out
Aight, then, maybe they should get a U-Haul pack that shit in a matress
Nah, they best go Greyhound, it's still the same as motherfuckin taxes
And all we gotta do is hold our breath about three more days
And cross our fingers, and hope nobody get popped along the way
You can make this quick lick and be set up for life
But if your ass get stuck, I hope it ain't your third strike
It's the roll of the dice
That you can't afford to lose
And them things you last expect, sometimes out there waitin
But I hope you understand if you caught then you ain't got shit to say
It's the nature of the business
It's the smugglers who lose
It's the roll of the dice
That you can't afford to lose
It's the nature of the business
It's the smugglers who lose
Everything is goin' according to plan
This shit is on its way to the man, to the man
Sit next to the goddamned man (Right)
But there's one thing you should know
There's some bustas on the bus talkin' loud and drinkin' and actin' the fool,
That shit ain't cool (Say what?)
Now, I don't want to have to switch this loc
So, send some bodies to the next stop to get this under control
(They on they way)
But be aware that they all wearin navy uniforms
And they got medals and patches and shit, they think that say Desert Storm
And they got ""Gung Ho"" written all over they chest
So tell Lek Ratt, D-Dog, P.S. to wear they vest
It's gettin' kinda cold out here so I'ma have to be gone
Wait, here that? Oh, I think somethin' wrong *gunshots*
What's Up? Baby, what's goin' on, man? What! What the fuck happenin'?
Aw, shit, my nigga, I'ma have to face shit
I think somebody set us up, there's feds all over the place
That's the name of the game, that's the way the game go
Sometimes you rise high, and sometimes you sink low
It's the roll of the dice
That you can't afford to lose
If you make it back to the hood then I'll see you around
But if they got somebody watchin, then stay your ass outta town
It's the nature of the business
It's the smugglers who lose
It's the roll of the dice
That you can't afford to lose
It's the nature of the business
It's the smugglers who lose
It's the roll of the dice
That you can't afford to lose"
51,On My Way to Harlem,1994,It Takes a Thief (1994),Hip Hop,Coolio,"I know a place where the trees don't grow
Just another place where niggaz live low
I know a place where life is fucked up
Make a wrong move and your ass get stuck up
Time ain't nothin' but a frame of mind
And life is like a mountain or a steep ass climb
I've been lookin' for a place to leave
The only free place is inside of me
So let's take a trip, and you don't need a grip
But you better be equipped cause it might be some shit
African-American, nothin' but a nigga
Had our fingers on the trigger, but I pulled mine quicker
I know a place where there ain't no calm and
You better stay away if you're soft like Charmin
South Central, Los Angeles, Watts, and Compton
A nigga on the west coast on his way to Harlem
Now it's time to step into the light (Light)
Put up your dukes, there's gonna be a fight (Fight)
And when it's time to fight, you better fight right
'Cause if it don't fight right, out goes the light
Take a close look at what I'm freakin on
Niggaz think I'm tweekin, but I'm speakin' on
Subject matter, data
Information that I gather
Through my travels
Cause the hardest of the hard, hit hardcore killer
Can't stop the slug of a nine millimeter
Everybody thinks they know, but they know not
If they haven't caught a cap on the block *gunshot*
So shine up your boots and pick up the pieces
Grab a fresh pair of khakis with the sharp ass creases
Ring the alarm, here comes the storm
I got a firearm on my way to Harlem
I know a place where the sun don't shine
Everybody is a victim of neighborhood crime
I know a place where niggaz walk the line
One false step and they must do time
Since I'm in the same boat
I must stay afloat
And sing every note
From the quotes that they wrote
So, I look into the past and walk the path of the greats
So I won't make the same mistakes that sealed my ancestors fates
If I had to be a slave I'd rather be in my grave
If I get in how many lives could I save?
One, two, three, a hundred, a thousand
My heart is poundin, the devil keeps soundin
But he don't want my money, he wants my soul
So I reach like a tree, and like a weed I grow
My stomach is full, but my mind is starvin
Rollin' in a g ride on my way to Harlem"

I shook thee
I coulda took him, but he wadn't even worth a bullet
I had my finger on the trigger, but I couldn't pull it

To hit the mic for a licken

So, why you tellin' me to sell a key of yayo
That's how you give a fellow need like Jayo
We lay low
All up in the cut
If it's suicide then roll the bustas up
And I'ma hit 'em up like uppercut
Better shuffle yo feet like double dutch
Now the party didn't start till I walked in
And it probably wont end till I sip Hen
But in the meantime
And in between time
Better tuck in your chin
And learn to take your lumps and grin
You know you can't wait 'cause I'ma stay on one
One switch, one sack, one sip, but I ain't done
I got one mo switch I can hit

When you's a grown woman and you's a grown man
I got open ears when the world ain't tryin' hear
When I can't be there in the flesh I be there in the spirit
I'm tryina make an impression on the things that you care for
The knowledge that I give, you could teach your kids
I know it's hard growing up 'cause I used to be a youngsta
So we don't work as a team, saw the liquor take us under

Light and stars all around me and above me
Never feelin' good, I watch a motherfucker work
Try to step into the Circle I chop 'em up like wood
Put 'em in an envelope and send it off to Interscope
'Cause nigga's gettin' short, I'm chokin from the smoke
I pass it to my homey so he can take a toke
Got a large loot, got it robbin that's 'cause I was broke
Jumped in the bucket, mad styles like a demon

Empty .45 was layin on the dresser
Last night I played the role of the tester
Toked up a good bag, Jenna had a good nap
Flashback got me ready to scrap
I don't know what I done did and I don't know where I done been
I know last night I robbed my friend and if that's wrong then call it a sin
But I was broke and broke ain't no joke and I can't cope without my Smith so so dip it up and watch me suck it up and I'll get fucked up and I might go nuts

59,Somebody's Gotta Die,2001,Coolio.com (2001),Hip Hop,Coolio,"Get your back, call tomorrow, life is borrowed
All your tears in sorrow and bring it back and that's a fact
Where would you be at, make sure you're pushin' harder to it
The game was changed when the bullshit was brought here
Our sets are fallin' now they live in love
We got five bucks or four reproduction of the clothing and gloves
You rather see me in a cell, than see me make my mail
And when the story he tell, he trying to make you fail
Trying to make some money lope but money makes no man
If you have no pen than you have no money in your hand
We're so dope, dive and steal, anything but paid for real
Damn you folks, if you wouldn't choked when you forgot to keep it real
Cops came back, rubbers in the back
What you snap when you couldn't lack
Now you feel the pressure when you didn't count your blessings
Now we're gone, you are alone
Told your mama that you was grown
One to the neck and three to the chest
When you ran for your life all alone
Now you're gone, now would your homies die for you, fool
I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right
No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight
She doesn't wanna die right, they don't wanna die right
No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight
I've cacker-rouches in my black boots
Nigga we sued them till they were in the mud
We hold the coffin, it isn't possible they got away running muthafucka
In the dust, cought up in the ghetto tradegy
That makes a nigga to fall, unless he's tall
This is reality mixed with society
Families tored apart but this tearing apart was hard
Stand and askin' where is God, don't you try to play missunder Lord
And the rest has been said, say rest in peace 'cause my nigga is dead
Before they beginning to run and make everything go under
I'm gonna knock as hard as my mother not gonna wonder
'Cause I knew it'd be me
Everyone's coming gathering to see
Remain in flames what I used to be, this is no more R.I.P
You never know when they're coming to get ya
But have them bullets ready for protection
Take them bodies who has fallen as a collection
But when they attack, you gotta go, we're under control
We gather to squeese us
We hope many men will recover in smoke
'Cause we never die in casulties, and we are the casulties of war
We are the casulties of war, we are the casulties of war
I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right
No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight
She doesn't wanna die right, they don't wanna die right
No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight
I saw them coming from a mile away
I couldn't stay I had to make my getaway, I lived to find another day
That's how it goes when this game we play
Everybody on board got a price to pay
You better pay attention to what I say, go to Hell if you don't pray
These streets are hard, walkin' down the Boulevard
Like walkin' through a prison yard
You never know when the bullets fly off
The pressure is on your money, boy beginning to fall
And your name gotta be strong to make them fools run from court
Oh man you're in jail but you can't call your crew
'Cause those niggas don't used to be a crew, now they're after you, ooh
People seen that you used to be a teen
But you ran against the Benz, niggas on the scene
I guess they sucked out your brain, cut you in your jeans
Lucky you're not what they hate but they beat up what they see
Don't you ever go 'round and scream it separates the boys from men
Cought your closest on your seat
And that's my dearest fairest friend
I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right
No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight
She doesn't wanna die right, they don't wanna die right
No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight
(We are the casulties of war
We are the casulties of war
We are the casulties of war)
I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right
No nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight

Before I go to work I smoke me a fat sack
Of indo, then climb through the window
And eye the VCR, and load it in the Pinto, huh!
Yes I'm on my way to the bait
Or should I say the pawn shop, but I don't smoke rocks
Some people say I'm crazy and they think I'm on crack
'Cause I hock all the shit and I never get it back
Coolio loco, you better call Bronco
Stole a link from my auntie, and sold it to my uncle
Took the flowers from a hearse, romanced a nurse
Put the girl to sleep then I went through her purse
Bandit, underhanded, yes I'm skanless
Snake in the grass fool, I'm taking chances
If the price is right, you can call me a killer
Before I was a rap singer, they called me Sticky Finger
(""But he's stickin you, and takin' all of you money"" -- Guru)

Coolio call me shady, janky, slick right
You and your crew better duck from my gunshots
I takes no shit, carryin no drama
If I can't get you I bust a cap on your momma
I never had a grip, so I learn how to shoplift
My trenchcoat is long and now I got some fresh shit
Yeah, buddy, sht's lookin' good
Gets much props and respect from the hood
Caps from my raps and a trunk full of hubcaps
Step to the crew, and you're bound to catch a pimp slap
But I don't pimp no bitch for my dough
They got somethin' I want, I just rob the hoe
Early birds catch the worm so I crow like a rooster
They follow me round the store because they know that I'm a booster
Tell me what you want and I'll be the stealer
Call me Coolio, or call me Sticky Fingers

I don't wanna go to jail 'cause I don't like the lockup
Turn out the lights and get ready for the sock up
One plus three equals four for the knockout
Got circles on that ass like a Mike Tyson PunchOut
You better hide your shit if you wanna keep it
I'm driving down the street in your 'llac while you're sleepin'
I was born with a sickness, that they call brokeness
Never said I was the best, but I'm damn sure the loc'est
Up, up, and away, like a rocket
Some fool got shot, now I'm goin' through his pockets
He won't be needin no dollars where he's goin'
And when I get to hell I'ma act like I don't know him
I'm takin' everything that ain't bolted to the floor

And the policy of the people is passive And all the women got fat asses
And all the homies got dubs and deeds to spend
And when the po-po's pass they wave and say ""hi""
And wear a grin (hey)
And everybody that you meet is a potential friend
And the women in your life love you for yourself and not your ends
And the population's real so there's no reason to pretend
And ignore we are the same, so no one hates you for the colour of your skin
And every waking thought is one of peace and harmony and bliss
That simple satisfaction like a plate of eggs and grits
Senses fully alive like the feeling of a first kiss
And when it's check out time you got a smile on your lips, huh
And the whole world is like a next-door neighbour
Quick to do you a favour even though we come in a million different flavours
And I know there's not enough time to put it all in one rhyme
So I savour the flavour and sweet taste I feel from the rays of the sunshine
I'm sittin' in the sunshine
The sunshine, like the world was mine, the sunshine
I'm walkin' in the sunshine
The sunshine, like the world was mine, the sunshine
If love was a flower I'd spread the petals about the planet And plant seeds throughout every city and country
Even in those who do not want me
I try to make some sense of the situation that we call life
Some, verbal illustration to help ease this strife
Some, lyrical penetration to try to make things right
In hopes that what I'm saying can saturate your mindframe
And help you with the pain and the strain of the everyday struggle

Never thought it could happen to you and your crew
But your blood is no sexual, started out frontin' it was all 'bout kicks
And each and every kick seem to turn out to be a trick
Imagine this, they have no family, they got no ends
They got no hustle, no muscle, no car no crew, they got no friends
Once all in the neighbourhood bouncing tall
No G living life as walking dog
Niggas hate to admit it but they know it's true
They're running down the hood having kids wanna be just like you
Here I stand as a witness, trying saying, claiming, selling a victim
Get just spit 'cause it's a sick ass system
You can roll when I'm rolling out from the smoke
Somebody take a vote, the devil is dope
The devil is dope (out of control) the devil is dope
The devil is dope (out to get your soul) the devil is dope
Pain seen, only imagine in my dream
The same nightmare screamin' on the scene and the TV screen
'Cause if I told that, 'round your waste I have to tie you
Everything is going black, a little bit of that, picture that
But you still can't see the thug around is demon
You need cocaine if he's tripping around then scream
Traffic is slow so you come to work at 5
So you're dancing 'round your consience and try to stay alive
Now you try to play hockey with some chicks
Niggas tell you to kick that and kick back, but you did that
And all money ain't good money
But everyone wants the cream and honey
They can have the other side as well that is so sunny
But loves only jealousy, leaves people here to grieve
From AC to old G to BG toBC
How did you call when you choked from all the smoke
Murder he smokes, the devil is dope
The devil is dope (out of control) the devil is dope
The devil is dope (out to get your soul) the devil is dope
Sunshine on your mind but darkness revile
You move yourself from hotel to hotel
Free records and a glass from cash to ash
Blood shit off your whole blown personality crash
And as your task try to make a milk ticket
So you can kick in and stripp with your chickens, but
You's the picked man since you got your own mind
It ain't hard and your fault but you gotta make your own time
Choose your weapon 'cause you're the first to wrestle
Often dictators in situations that you find yourself cought in
If you're still blind and you can't see
You better obtain yourself some glasses and clear your vision like dmc
I remember what I told you, remember who are the soldiers
I wonder who are the strangers
'Cause there's too large amount of danger
Man I'm on board am I the under lord
Put your ass on the boat, the devil is dope
The devil is dope (out to get you soul) the devil is dope
Listen, the devil is dope (oh lord lord lord) the devil is dope
The devil is dope, you better believe it, you better believe it
You better believe it, you better believe it, the devil is dope
The devil is dope (so much, so much pain) the devilis dope"
64,The Revolution,1995,Gangsta's Paradise (1995),Hip Hop,Coolio,"I'm seein' bodiez in the alley and blood in the valley
From the shores of Maine all the way to Compton Cali
I'm callin' rally to the homies in the street light
Take a real close at what it look like
A young nigga in the ghetto raised up on whit
The first thing momma told him was don't take no shit
Playin' tag with body bag,
Bullets,
And bloody rag
And did you put the dodge on the toe tag?
Whoever the man today, might not be the man tomarrow
'Cause life is full of hardships, pimpslaps, and sorrow
Ya gotta believe in something, but whatever ya do
Make sure what you believe is real and true
Fuck the liez an' alibiez an' come to realize
My vision won't assault of wasted on blind lil' eyes
Like A T an' T ya gotta make a switch
O' get pushed to the side like a lil' ol' bitch...
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be up front
With my finga on the trigga of a Mossburgh Pump
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be right there
With my nine in my hand and braids in my hair
I've been hollerin' and hoopin' yeah
Lootin' an' shootin'
I'm doin' some recruitin' to bring mo' troops in
Niggaz don't be doin' what they 'posed to do
They betta post on the corna with the busta crew
Playin' games I used to play back in '79
With the same bullshit an' the same ol' lie
If you want some respect ya won't be individual
On the nigga nuts 'cause he rollin' in the Sixty-fo'
Yo favorite line is fuck all a y'all
But one day there's gonna be a final call
That's why I'm rollin' deep in the motherfuckin' Jeep
Always on the peep an' my crew don't fall asleep
So pull your money outa your pocket an' put it in the middle
This ain't no roosta ass Chicken George nigga on a fiddle, huh
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In my mothafuckin' self I trust...
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be up front
With my finga on the trigga of a Mossburgh Pump
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be right there
With my nine in my hand and braids in my hair
Way back in the dayz we used to sling 'em in the street
But now when niggaz get beat
They wanna go an' get their heat
Everybody know that you know how to kill
But tell me do you how to let a nigga live
I gotta dream that maybe one day
Niggaz can't fight then walk away
I'm talkin' fist-a-cuffs put the pistols up and shoot 'em from
The shoulders to show that you can hold yours
I sing the song of the fight of the black man
In America
In a state of hysteria
No longa will I accept the second rate
I plan to set the record straight b'fore I disobey
It's the one - two combination punch to the throat
There's a hole in ya boat bitch
That's all she wrote
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In my mothafuckin' self I trust...
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be up front
With my finga on the trigga of a Mossburgh Pump
When the Revolution come I'm gonna be right there
With my nine in my hand and braids in my hair"
65,Thought You Knew,1994,It Takes a Thief (1994),Hip Hop,Coolio,"Never gave a fuck and I still don't
So save your lectures, I'ma gangbang for the rest of my life
A young BG deranged in the brain
The youngest motherfucker on the chain gang
Yeah I still slang my thangs like a G
Really can I make your ass rest in peace?
No need to waste my energy squabbin
Quick to pull the trigger, put your ass in a coffin
Never been a baller but I trap many ballin
Homies y'know I don't give a fuck, I was starvin
You better hide your daughter 'cause I'm out to get laid with dick
And have her sprung on this black ass nigga
Straight up out the gutter, have her stealin from her daddy and her mother
Sellin rocks to the scandalous ass clockers
Ready to meet my snaps, yeah I'm cool like that
And I never gave a fuck about a stupid ass hoodrat
Bitches ridin' on my bit
Niggas hit me up and shit
But I'm from the Eastside
Where the niggas do or die
Representin like a dream
'Cause Circle's deep I thought you knew
Uh, uh, uh
As I crack dice from one hood to the next
Doin' credit card schemes and cashin hot cheques
I got a 9 for any nigga that come runnin' up
Keepin' motherfuckers on the duck
You can give a this or that sling, the yeah or the tracks
But when your chick starts choking ya, you gots ta break me off
I sweat ya like Keith until ya give me my ends
If a nickel bag is sold in the park I want in
In the middle of the night when the spot's not hot
You can find Billy Boy rollin' down your block
Hittin switches 'cause your bitch is gettin' paid, 'cause that's my way
And all the hoes still wanna fuck (You know we do)
I bleed like the next man but when the gat is in my hand
You can bet my monkey ass is comin' out on top
LA hustlers can't live without money
So before I make sense I gots ta make a knot
'Cause I can't fuck without my hoes
And I can't hit no switch without the 6-4
Everybody wanna fuck a nigga like me
But I won't be gettin' back in the CPT
Niggas tryin' to give me stuff
Billy Boy don't give a fuck
First I warn you with my rhyme
Then I'll fuck you with my 9
Don't give your plees 'cause I don't bang
But I'm down to fully slang
40 Thevz end down your crew
'Cause Circle's deep I thought you knew
I fold a rapper like a dollar just to hear his punk ass holler
Walk into his hood and grab his homies by the collar
Stock 'em all up like a pack of punk bitches
Now I got his whole crew wearin heels and doin' dishes
You don't wanna see me out the motherfuckin front
Don't you take this shit for granted just 'cause niggas call me Cool
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
C-O-O-L-I-O G
M to the A, A to the D
A Circle full of niggas that you don't wanna see
You ain't nuttin but a pistol that's fuckin' with a missile
I chew your ass like gristle till the ref blows the whistle
Sing a song of six packs, a pocket full of snaps
Ain't no punks in my motherfuckin pack
See I use to be broke now I blow indo smoke
First you diss my city then you choke
*Cough*
C-O-M-P-T-O-N
Punk motherfuckers get two to the chin
I don't give a fuck what'cha got or who you know
Step to the Maadness, your ass gotta go
Ain't a damn thing changed but only the year
East Coast, West Coast get the *?c'reer?*
You don't wanna see my crew

Well, get on down like your 'posed to and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to and give a loc a little dap when he walks through
If there be a dope beat then all y'all see
Get up out your seat and let me see yo technique
Freak yo physique and you betta not compete
Make it hot and sweaty like twenty deep in a jeep
Never comin' cheap, forty creep
And I hope you don't mind if I borrow a few things while you go to sleep
I steal money from the rich
And give it to the poor, it's
Coolio loco and ghetto witch doctor super, you are
Bring it from the back and bring it to the front
Cause you gotta give the people what they want
Now hump, do the stomp to the butt
Big homie shake your gut
As long as you get your ass up
It's a party over here
And let me make it clear
40 Thevz is the crew
So you better come anew
Ain't a damn thing change since the first one
And if you didn't hear the album go get one (One)
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to and give a loc a little dap when he walks through.
Here come the thief on the old school beat
And I never knew the meaning of the word ""defeat""
The master of disguise wanna see the people's eyes
Yet, fools try to deny that the ?man? can fly
Just cook 'em all up like gumbo
And block their ass like Mutumbo
Cause your album dropped off the charts like Dumbo
We are new and improved to make you put on your boogie shoes
Like K.C. and the Sunshine Band, or the Wu-Tang Clan
I go way back like Vegas, Nixon, Noreaga
It's the tennis shoe players fat box on the quiet station
Now what if hip hop was like Humpty Dumpty sittin' on the wall
And what if hip hop had to take a great fall
And what if rhyme was a crime
And each and every time
That you spit a dope line
You might have to do some time
Most of these clowns will be tryin' to skip town
But Coolio will be ready for the showdown
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down' like your 'posed to and pass a joint to the loc when he roll through
If the shoe fit, put it on and stick
And if your ass uncash don't let your mouth write no check
Fools be in the bars unadvanced with a switch
Uppercuts and fight kicks with Weird Al Yankovich
From Tokyo to Sojo, rollin' wit the 4-0
This hip hop that I'm holdin' I'll make it move your hoe
It's the Vandino, everything but rhyme's broken
Breakin' a nigga with first position at the open
You can't understand how I do it
I'm just true to it
I let my pen flow across the paper like it was made affluent
Uh, let it ring, let it rip
Everybody holler like Marvin Gaye, but don't you let the record skip
Synchronize the watch, cause the party don't stop
Till the neighborhood watch call the cops
It's the wild ass festival, coast line veteran
Once again droppin' bombs on yo section (On yo section)
Are you ready to throwndown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to and pass the brew to the loc when he roll through
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to and give a loc a little dap when he roll through.

Oh-oh it's too hot (too hot) too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot) too hot, homie (too hot)
Gotta make some sense from this mess that we made
You're doin' everything momma told you not to do
Now you're tryin' to walk away cause you know it's true
Your sister can't explain, and your brother's ashamed

Gotta hip her to the game of those smooth talkin' niggaz
Love is the word seldom meant, but often heard
Latex, safe sex, you better learn
Or get hip to the facts before you react, or

Nuclear waste, cannibalism, and pistol smoke
Sex, lies, videotape and rape
Just a little bump-n-grind can seal your fate
We need to do something drastic, shit is gettin' tragic
And if you don't believe me, then go ask Magic
Everybody and they momma preachin' abstinence, these
Kids ain't checkin' for absti-shit
So put a condom in they hand and hope it don't bust

That a ho is a ho wit a toe-up slut so
If you're gotta have em, might as well be a fine one
But it seems that some niggas can't seem to find one
So they go and get a bitch that's lookin' like Trixie
And Hekkyl and Jekkyl wit some saggy ass titties
A big fat flagrant hoodrat hooker
And the nigga got the nerve to pretend she's a hooker
Sportin that down from your arm like a Simpson
Talk about bitches that you wish you was pimpin'
Come around the homies and you swear that she's playin'
But every time I see her, you're beggin
Go get you a girl that got somethin' goin'
Get rid of that bitch that's lookin' like a dragon
Now you wanna fight 'cause you're baggin on your Mrs
But that's what'cha get when you fuck with ugly bitches
When I was young I used to have fun
Fuckin' with ugly bitches
But now that I'm grown I leave 'em alone
'Cause I went from rags to riches
They say 'beauty is skin deep' but goddamn weeded bitch
Look like buckwheat mixed with opi
Toe up, toe up, straight from the floor
And her bad ass breath is about to make me throw up
Niggas started dissin and you blamed it on the gin
But the very next day you was with the bitch again
Now your ass is gettin' clowned like Bozo
But that's what you get for fuckin' with that ugly ho
I don't know what possessed you, nigga
Stand that hooker in front of a trigger
Spendin your time with a big goony-goo-goo
To niggas like you I gotta say ""Choo choo""
Dig a ditch down in desperation
Send that monster on a permanent vacation
The girl is chop-top, but you don't listen
'Cause some niggas like fuckin' with ugly bitches
When I was young I used to have fun
Fuckin' with ugly bitches
But now that I'm grown I leave 'em alone
'Cause I went from rags to riches
Aw shit, there go my nigga pretendin he don't see me
Talkin' with a bitch that look like a flea G
Holdin' her hand as he walks through the plaza
I try to play it off but I couldn't hold my laughter
The girl is done so take her ass off the oven
Put her on a BOOM and send her back to the covent
Cookin up a plan in a big, black cauldron
And the dumb ass nigga don't know that he's fallin'
Into a trap 'cause now the whore is pregnant
9 months later and she's squirted on an insect
He don't wanna claim it, she went and got a test
Now he's sendin child support in a big fat cheque
My nigga got depressed and he started drinkin' liquor
One night he got drunk, went to her house and killed her
Riches to rags and rags to riches
But that's what'cha get when you fuck with ugly bitches
When I was young I used to have fun
Fuckin' with ugly bitches
It seems that it's sad for this pussy I had
Came from some ugly bitches
When I was young I used to have fun
Fuckin' with ugly bitches
It seems kinda sad 'cause this pussy I had
Came from some ugly bitches
So you mean to tell me you fuckin' with a bald-headed, ol' fat, lumpy,
Droopy, crack baby look-a-like, cisco drinkin', loud, ignorant, fucked-up
Teeth, stank hoodrat, won't down, once-a-month bleedin, butthead swap-meet,

Ain't no logic or no reason in your teachings
I'm steady on the grind round while you're reachin'
So just sit and look and listen, hear my twenty screechin
What is an MC if he can't rap?
How you gonna throw up from the shoulder and can't scrap?
Twenty-five with a L, ain't no gettin' back
Where niggaz do it all, homie just like that
What is a DJ if he can't scratch?
How you gon' keep on trickin and stay fat?
Jump your ass in a gunfight without no strap
Where niggaz do it all, homie just like that
You can be yourself when you come round here
Ain't no titles or no belts when you come round here
Keep your game on stealth when you come round here
But be about your wealth when you come round here
You get cut and left when you come round here
So don't let 'em see you sweat when you come round here
We'll be makin' busters melt when they come round here
So you'd better check yourself when you come round here
We be gettin' gangsta with it all through the weekend
Get your lazy ass up, no time for sleepin'
Call your homegirls up, jump in your jeep and
They ain't ready when you come, then you're leavin'
You're goin' to the club, it's time for freakin
You ain't got no ID to try to sneak in
It's on and crackin' once again you cheat the G-game
Just open up your mind, no time for tweakin
What is an MC if he can't rap?
How you gonna throw up from the shoulder and can't scrap?
Twenty-five with a L, ain't no gettin' back
Where niggaz do it all, homie just like that
What is a DJ if he can't scratch?
How you gon' keep on trickin and stay fat?
Jump your ass in a gunfight without no strap
Where niggaz do it all, homie just like that
Fat meat is greasy when you come round here
So don't be acting cheesy when you come round here
You might go off the heasy when you come round here
And we'll still be bumpin Eazy when you come round here
You better watch the greedy when you come round here
'Cause some of these fools are sleazy when you come round here
Give to the needy when you come round here
But understand you can't defeat me when you come round here
Most stack a grip, trip and roll with some new friends
Some'll sell their soul to the devil just to chip in
Some'll lie, steal and rob their mama just to get ends
Which one is you nigga?
Where do you fit in?
But this thing don't stop just 'cause you's a trick
And hatin' 'cause you ain't rich, you's a bitch
We gon' dip like the old school, c'est la vie
Hop your tread like me
Watch what you say and get paid like C
What is an MC if he can't rap?
How you gonna throw up from the shoulder and can't scrap?
Twenty-five with a L, ain't no gettin' back
Where niggaz do it all, homie just like that
What is a DJ if he can't scratch?
How you gon' keep on trickin and stay fat?
Jump your ass in a gunfight without no strap
Where niggaz do it all, homie just like that"
