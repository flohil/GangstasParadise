0,1 Train,2013,Long. Live. A$AP (2013),Hip Hop,ASAP Rocky,"Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account
X the O's in my bed is 'round the same amount
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, ""DOO DOO!"" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, ""Mmm mmm,"" let's play ball
In a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold, I rhyme cold
My K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9 drone
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: ""Ho, I'm the meanest""
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, on shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich pot shit
Hoes on some God shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon's reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses drop on boxes very often
Confetti torture, drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Grambling
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, ""How you ask for that?""
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes and cherish your wins
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey's ass
That's out of line, but in living color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist"
1,Acid Drip,2011,Live. Love. A$AP (2011),Hip Hop,ASAP Rocky,"Feelin' out of place, plus its gettin' kinda late
Tryna make it home safe, and not get raped. Where you live?
Tina tummy ache, Gina got the funny face
Mona's sniffin dope, so Odoma's leanin' on the rib[?]
I bet you wish you had a Benz cause you just helped you friends
Flag a taxi. Now you walkin' not too far from your crib
Cravin for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
Said you feelin' flabbergasted you just had to have it
Made your way to 7th ave. Flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Black kid French braids and he keep it potent?
Hold ya purse don't trust him cause his teeth is golden
Dice rollin' reefer blowin' in the streets he smokin'
Blowin' weed while police patrollin
Acid strips, purple drink you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip
Hand on the dail kiss on the lips
Eye for an eye drip for a drip
I getcha high please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya drip

Gotta find my way back home, I'm moving...
War Lords, we all Lords, but we your Lords
Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim, raw dogs
You other rappers mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mats off, till I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr Miyagi and Issey Miyake
Ass hole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head so good on that girl that I might pay her, or no
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been way too long
Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi
Roll through the city, that Joseph is in me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it
On plenty, any, [?]
That ever voted against me, dissed me
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated (all of the wrong[?]) they did me
You stored in my memory all of the doors that I thought of
Means walk from my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies
Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis
Bitches been sniffing
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
How in the fuck could you front on em
My old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends
Bronson told me not to eat ham, rest in peace Yams
Rest in peace Yams, RIP A$AP Yamborghini
We gon' take it up town one time
We gon' take 'em back, show 'em how me do
They call me Pretty Flacko ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to introduce Pretty Flacko Sir
Yasiin Bey
Magnum spectacular, black man megalas
Shine amethyst, fly champion, it's like that again
What's happening? Mathematics master blin'
Flacko season, all day, erryday
Ask me how it's going, I tell 'em on and on and on and on and
You led me out to [?]
Steady flowing, staying golden
Sand cover, ready Rover
Flacko glowing in that Owens, that's how it's going
Awareness to the areas, familiar with the routes
Travellin man, moving through places space in time
In a country called Earth
Nah'mean, these tack ass mah'fucker be in the pictures. Wearing all types of mother fuckin' red and green stripes, over accessorizing out this mother fucker. We from Harlem, we gave y'all mother fucker this wave. Grab y'all surfboards, cause y'all got your boogy boards ready now.

Got my goons on deck, and we got a hundred straps

Everybody know we got the shit and baggages to match
Better come correct, fuck what the basis is
Gold grills like a set of new braces's
Why they comment on my set though, they lookin' cause my neck gold
And I let that Tec show... hear that echo?
Let go, that medal, .38 special, to your threshold
Niggas actin' petro, like they sexual, was metro

You should fuck with me girl
You know what you need girl
See I got used to livin' life up on my own, yeah
And searching lovely for a wife to call my own, yeah
It's all I think about at nights when I'm alone, yeah
Swear that I can't get no rest in California
Swear that life is just a whole bunch of vices
Niggas biting off of my shit, my dick
Stay up in your chick ride stick without a license
Tell her hold on like some vice grips
Might just call her, let her ride with a baller
Look up on her face was priceless, wonder what my type is
Well tonight Mrs. Lightskin with a light mix, or a light switch
White chick, dark skin complexion and she righteous
I take a dyke chick if she like dick
I kissed the dyke chick and I liked it
Fucking each and every Katy Perry for the night bitch
Light this
Light it light it, puff it puff it, pass it, pass it
(Moving on to better things)
Just sit back and relax one time, clear your mind
'Bout to send me back to my old ways
Know what I mean
I've been puffing, rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin' up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generation's thrown on drugs
I swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth
Next time I see her might curse the bitch out
Kicked the bitch out once 'cause she bitched out
Spit my kids out, jizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce
Ride with a nigga mane, and you know I stay fly like the jigga mane
And it figures, 'cause here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man, anyways
Nowadays everybody's stressed, yes
Animosity is better off your chest, yes
Everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh
Take a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts
Light it light it, puff it puff it, pass it, pass it

Inhale exhale, relieve your mind of stress
Smoke some one time for your boy A$AP

9,Canal St.,2015,At. Long. Last. A$AP (2015),Hip Hop,ASAP Rocky,"Yeah, live through the strugglin', life's a every day hustle
I hustle every day in life thinkin' back
Takin' packs up the block them older niggas said I couldn't hustle
Man fuck 'em niggas, I'll be back, strapped back pack
Bitch I'm flipping work, hand in hand, I think they call it trappin'
Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
Face the fact, there's always niggas out there tryin' to knock the hustle
I guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin'
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red broaches on the cuff
On my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, ands or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spend on Goyard
Used it once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, real as a gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housing
Wildin' 'til they throw me in 'em cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartier's
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say Uh
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're speakin' to the script
My life is like a movie, they should film me through it
Take a pic, then show the frame and shit, forever me, was always G
Way before this famous shit, y'all just pretend to do it
You say you got 'em guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you get 'em drugs, but I've never seen you sling
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
You say you got 'em guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you get 'em drugs, but I've never seen you sling
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
Rap game like the crack game, swear it's all the same, hustle
Whippin' soda through the pot, watch it bubble
Flex a muscle, hit the block, I better teach you niggas how to hustle
Sellin' coca on the charts, watch it double
Uh, taking me in zoom and bust my shit, my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now to sum up my performances, just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck Jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous
Your favourite rapper's corpses couldn't match up my importance
My mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements

You say you get 'em drugs, but I've never seen you sling
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
You say you got 'em guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you get 'em drugs, but I've never seen you sling

I woke up and then I bought that bitch in every yellow
Let get back to business, my [?] for my narrow
'Cause life's a bitch with red lipstick and high stilettos
Flaco jumpin' fences from pigs, with 'em them biscuts
I hypnotized my 6, but my 38 was kinda special
What a life this is, what a sight this is
Where the darks and the light skin kids
Get along with the white percents
Or alike when the lights go dim
On a righteous pass, where you don't look back
Nigga spark your cig, niggas light your hash
Niggas light your spliff, where you puff, don't pass, just sit
I just had an epic dream like Dr. King
Police brutality was on my TV screen

To another dimension my mind
Body, soul imprisoned my eye
Probably going ballistic but listen
I'm missing a couple of screws
They ain't never do dreaming true, you been sipping away at the truth
But besides the wisdom I do-do-do
Rolling do, hitting switches, rolling ditches, blowing kisses
To the bitches, hold the biscuits, what's the business
Beat the system, cold defendants
Blow the symptoms, go to prison
Go to church and pray to father Lord forgive us
And only God can judge me
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fucking good most dykes'll fuck me buddy

Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andre
Beef is on my entre, gin and juice that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday, fitness on a Monday
My new crib came with feng shui
And my closet is like a runway
Come be fiancee, she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge
Just a sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie ass bitch made wait to fuck for two days
Finally go the two day, swear to god my mood change
Top off like toupes, drop off, touche
Yeah my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy
Bounce, boy, Flacko tellem holla at a nigga G
Riding on my enemies, this my Ghetto Symphony
Whippin whitney, My mama as a witness
Bitches Lickin' and locking up my swishas
Once she blow my whistle
She know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official
Now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive
Forget it, war ready, already tested
Tears and blood invested
Till my cardiacs arrested and my 40 oz is empty
Show me watcha owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires only I
Rolling down the lonely mile phony smile, was
Police on me now, still touring
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain, in it's purest form
Don't complain I came to reign
From here forward, still noid
So crib got clear doors
Burning grains in my air force
And all I can see is clear ports
Since Rocky spit like Andre I'm gonna kill em' like Big Boi
These rappers is all my entrée
Eat em' like cookies, chips ahoy
Eat, enjoy, when I get annoyed
No cover niggas that I kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Money get style, my lil fishin boy
Arnold Schwarzeneger, toss a nigga
Like codein mixed with a Roy
Smoke what make a nigga trip collide
What took me how fast, you could grip a 9
Damn, nigga I doubt they tell this my heart
And the motherfuckers come in to cry
You niggas have a sour dipped in wine
Guess that's when a girl sip the white
Pourin liq so I soak in different shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky

So and so, niggas live and die

So tell me what your name is I'mma tell it to my stainless
You aim it for you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and motherfuckers that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell them to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad 'cause I'm smooth puffin' zig zag
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with yo bitch ass
Uh, uh, I said it must be, cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit till they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome till ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy till shit pop off
Yes I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
Whatchu mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissing pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell them ""tell it to my face""
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck the dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad 'cause I'm smooth puffin' zig zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with yo bitch ass

Still got my sleeves rolled up and my shirt tucked
Grown up? Sure enough
Sipping on that syrup
Purple Label shit, yeah I wear what I sip
Scarface vision, see my visions on a blimp
And a quarter key will turn a G into a gent
All-purpose flow, we are the great
I'm so Kurtis Blow, and these are the breaks
My Christian Louboutins got nails, give me hammer toes
Niggas get shy when that camera rolls
Drop crotch pants will remind you of them Hammer clothes
All-yellow Phantom, I'm like Yeezy in that amber Rolls
""Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha,"" but who am I kidding?
No way I could afford it so for now I'm just pretending
How these gold diggers digging without a single pot to piss in?
Cause my pockets full of lint and my heart is full of vision
I'm grown

I don't hear y'all much
I'm all grown up

Bow your head, the Most High's around cocktails
Guys and gals miss me, ties and gowns happen now
My attire sells, how you tryna sound? Stop it now
They ask me why I don't go to church no more
Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs
My sister the next stripper, my brother the next victim
My usher the next tricker
Satan givin' out deals, finna own these rappers
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
You sold your soul first, then your homies after
Let's show these stupid field niggas they could own they masters
Holy smokes, I think my pastor was the only folk
To own the Rollie, Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost
And get your shit prepared, face your fears, all you niggas scared
Say your prayers, pray he fit upstairs, it's our only hope
Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, ""Quiet down""
Bow your head, the Most High's around, Lord
(These things are not right, these things is not right
Hell, nobody's ever defined)
The pastor had a thing for designer glasses
Yeah, I'm talkin' fancy plates and diamond glasses
The ushers keep skimmin' the collection baskets
And they tryna dine us with some damn wine and crackers
Who's more important than your Lord and Saviour?
Won't let the pearly gates up in this
Probably do that on your poor behavior
My mentor got a couple tips to save ya
Just be sure to count it as my only favour, thank me later
Uh, every night I stayed up sayin' prayer, made me greater, uh

So I can cope that bathin ape or jeremy scott or 10 deep
Bottles full of rose ridin' in the benz jeep
Blowin' money fast now I'm finna think I'm big meech
I met with my old head we sat for a while
We rolled a couple swishers we chat for a while
I said I'm just on my grind I come to Houston all the time
He said what's been goin' down in your New York state of mind
Fiine there are bad days you feel like givin' up
Like how you gon eat when this gig is up
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck, roll another swisher up
'Cause I just came here down south so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere closer than a town house
And my beats bangin' kickin harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out
Life is just a bitch a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money money come and goes
Friends turn to foes foes they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin' you'll be straight
Now my old head old age bald head rogaine
Code red codeine, nose red cocaine
Pimpin' bitches since lemon chicken shrimp lo mein
Gold chains afros platforms soul train
And he told me bout that rappin' trappin in the old days
When pop homeboy shock before that rat tat tat tat tat nose rings
And I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sippin on somethin' purpler than soul plane
We sip slow slow swing tip fos and chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang hold up that's my old dame
Pick it up I hit you back miss me and I miss you back
She said harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap

I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you wanna leave
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuck
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuss
Holdin' back, ain't no turnin' back when you fall in love
Know what happens every time you speed
Always fall flat 'cause you wanna rush
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever
Can't last forever...
I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I'm here to say I
Make it even under lessons from me
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured...
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever
Can't last forever...
You're the eye, but I'm tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I'm never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart...
You made a bet with me, now you're in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It's ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin' 'gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I'm in her heart on the left titty
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and fire for me, that I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever
Can't last forever..."

I'm the type to wake up and say you're never having
I mean I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing
Left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like ""Flacko where your ass been?""
Heard you done with fashion, now yo ass is acting
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in Venice, Tommy and some mean Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture
Changed Hip-Hop on ya, smoking like a rasta was my pops culture

You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?

Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia

Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather

Especially when it's your advice

Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ay bitch you missed out, hashtag #Fomo

Thousand dollar drawers just to hold my balls
All I ever do is let my jewels sag
Pac gone, but the ""Juice"" back
Get your popcorn, juice, snacks
It's a movie nigga, with a new cast
Get the news flash, that the truth back
This is boom bap, mixed with new raps
Look at all the niggas that I blew past
Hood By Air, to the do-rag
Nigga make way for the new jacks
It's Mister Pistol Popper screaming ""fuck a copper""
I just bought a crispy choppa finna fuck yo block up
Even cracked the pavement that's for niggas hatin'
I been impatiently waitin' to show you niggas Satan
All this talk of Illuminati ain't got a clue about me
Bitch I'm Trill-Maluminati and got my crew behind me
Shootas round me, keep them looters round me
Keep a tool around me, it'll keep you fools from round me
Couple of them dudes surround me with a gat
Wit a strap in a backpack
When they cap cap, leave you flat, better back back
On a fast track, ratatat, nigga that's that
Nigga pass that, finna ash, where the hash at
Got a Kat Stacks with a ass, finna smash that
Make 'em cash that, A$AP then I pass that
Off to my niggas then she ask, ""Where the cash at?""
I see dead people, I need dead people

I'm so happy, you know um
You know I looked at the crowd and you know I
I look at my fans, I look at their faces, they expressions
And I know that damn well
We are some partying mother fuckers
(ASAP Rocky Verse 1)
Tired of these rappers, tired of these jackers
Tired of these dances by these backpackers
And I'm sick of all these hipsters
I'm sick of phony niggas
I'm sticking to these bitches, 'cause I'm sick of all these sisters
I'm sick and tired of tryna survive, I'm sick tired of my environment
I'm sick and tired of feeling deprived, I'm one of a kind, when in my climate
I'm sick and tired of your facade and all of your lying and all your diamonds
I'm basically sick and tired of feeling sick and tired (ASAP)
Born in money makin' Manhattan
Every nigga on my block wanna be a main attraction
Shout my nigga ?? shout my nigga Madre
If you disrespect them niggas then I'm polishin' the nadre
And I'm coming to your casa for your madre and padre
Comprende? Most of these niggas been gay or they strange
They say I sound like Andre mixed with Kanye
Little bit of Max, little bit of Wiz, little bit of that, little bit of this
Get off my dick

I'm in yo hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'm a down to earth nigga, we could kick it
Take a hit with me, take a hit with me
Ain't on stage behind the scene

Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Why don't ya come and take a sip with me
Take a sip with me

Once again Mr. Back selling crack
It's the how to keep it real nigga music on the map
Street raps, new face, sampled with no craze
Dousing myself 'cause I don't think the world can relate
To my surprise everyone does, so have faith
Half of the other side don't live it they push play
The young illest alive, Harlem world to the Bay
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
Cause last year it was shoe box and lint
I only write raps just to give you niggas hits
Every verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November, that's 20 years of memory
And that's assuming I'mma live that long
If I don't, don't cry 'cause I ain't live that wrong
Just an artist in a purest form, I live that song
An artist in a purest form, I live that song, Bambi

Why fuss? I rather fuck, treat her like my enemy
I just wanna bus, 7 deuce, waitin' on the bus
Before the boys bend the corner, tryna make a bust
Tryouts I'm tryna make the buss
Purple and the green got me on stuck
So I 2 step, move my foot and keep it pushin'
Always bouncin' back, got it keep the cushion
And that's somethin' fat, like eatin' all the puddin'
ASAP we got it slap, bruh good lookin'
Fuck that, ASAP where I come from
4 5 6, ice city slums
Weed in my pocket, coke in his tongues
Buying swisher sweets, no more honey buns
Fresh white tee, bright like the sun
Only nigger round here rockin' michigan

I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen

A bunch of hypocritic Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond rings, designer jeans
Toking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing

Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or toking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops, make him talk God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever I'll

You can't ever deny

Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch, know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick

We be plottin' on the ops, she the one who got the drop

Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simmons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick what? Pimps up, hoes down
Woah now, slow down
See they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh

Behind prison walls, nigga lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit, like the hard headed never listen, Lord

If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace

Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck

Am I still too young, am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up, did I fuck it up?
It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, mother fuck cops, what a blood clarts
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, bug shots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em switch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip...

Did I fuck it up, did I fuck it up?
I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young, am I still too young?

My struggle uh
My bittersweet symphony
My pain... Check it;
Verse 1 ASAP:
Food getting lower
Money coming slower
Damn landlord keep bitching cause you owe her
I'm too afraid to grow up
I'm pray to god I blow up
And roll up in something foreign where the front doors go up
I wonder if my peers
Could hear my prayers
The only nigga got me scared
Is the man upstairs
When my back against the wall
I'mma face my fears
I'll swallow my pride
'Fore I swallow a tear
'Cause I be going hard
Stevie on his job
I'm praying to something to happen?
??? ...To god
These wolves got me scarred
I try so hard
To survive
Guess just to prosper gotta strive
Then I hit the stage
And gone ???
Everybody know my name
And the song I sings
I rejoice my pain
And they doing the same
And the haters gonna hate
I'm just doing my thing
Got my bad bitch
With me she so (dangy?)
Said she love ASAP
'Cause we so tangy
Living life fast
So I feel like kids
And I'm blowing up fast
So I feel like BIG
With the super nintendo
Sega genesis
Now we doing deals with the major businesses
Get a little change
Niggas feel a little strange
Uh-Oh truck flow
Pull off in a range
Niggas say I changed
But I'm living it up
Shit if money didn't change you
You ain't getting enough
Fuck cop and the calm?
Tryna' fly to the stars
Smooth on the moon
And I be mobbing to mars
Niggas say I'm ill
Y'all ain't telling me shit
Nice ???
Y'all ain't help me with shit
Ooh money change drastic
Flew through gymnastic
The doors lift up
And the roof do a back flip
Zooming through traffic
Probably with a bad bitch
Slash actress and we on our way to Saks Fifth
Life was so tragic
All of that was past tense
Now I'm living lavish
This got to be magic
*Singing*:
If I should die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace
If I die before I wake
Please enjoy the songs I make
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace"

Patience is a virtue
Life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you
Learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post
While I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains
Like eggs, got it scrambled

And I understand Hov
What you think I rap for?
To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back
When you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me
Other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement
Probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full
But instead, you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy
But Rocky been Jiggy
Currency from The Wiz
Ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate
When they compare me to Drake
Could have been J.Cole

Stone cold love
Rose gold slugs
I could afford it
I imported stone cold drugs
Stone cold, rolling stone, I'm a stoned nigga
Write it on my tombstone, I was stoned nigga
Don't remember me as a wannabe New Orleans nigga
Slash lean sipping, Tennessee nigga, Nah
Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music
A trill nigga to the truest
Show you how to do this
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Said she's got a coke feel 'cause I'm so trill
Two dope boy scales, what I sold hails
No L, put her on her feet, toe nails
Them vampires, them blood suckers, them thirsty killers
We 'bout it 'bout it, we rowdy rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters, I'm bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla
Give me the title, then give me the cash
Fold it then bag it then move to the trash
Follow my stash
Stealing my swag
Niggas is wickity wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross
Her lip gloss, slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch, boss, Cristal
We smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Puff it and pass
Making it last
Walk in my shoes
And cross in my path
Game was for grabs
Making them crash
Took in a section
And giving they back

Fuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life
The insights of my trill life"

But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Rolling blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't round my clique for nothing
Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
Cause everyday we oughta have pesos

Cause everyday we oughta have pesos
Your bitches said that I'm hot, man I told her I agree
She going really think I'm hot, if I told her my Guilderberg degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch double D
Popping E I don't give a F, told you I'm a G

Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places, like apartments, basements
Garbage vacant, lots, garages, spaces, Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Mason Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my eye and lung 'til later die at 71
I lay down now
This someone's journey in the streets who gotta keep a, peace, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days or razor blades with gangs who bang and never stood a chance
Some boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement
And my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the high in me
Used to never give a damn now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me, it's gotta be
A whole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I've given

Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile you treated all of us like other niggas

Ever since a baby, two tussin sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups

Ricky had a deuce-deuce two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone thugs had more thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme

I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fist fights
And fish fries and shootouts like one SIG with two rounds
And click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitch
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back

Young and thuggin', buggin' showing out in public, but you love it
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, that you gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all got children and siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend,
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin,
Then it's back to the back of the Benz,
Lean back in the back with the Henn
And a crap when I tap that that then attack,
Never tax, never that that, max on the ends
Spend ends, I remember way back when,
A motherfucker used to have to borrow cash from my friends, friends
Just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me, them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me, from ugly to comfortably

It all changed man
It was just like yesterday

And now I'm comfortable

My niggas getting right, smoking weed with dirty sprite
Going wild for the night Fuck being polite
Finna wild out for the weekend
Me, myself, and I my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, ASAP niggas finnna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, ASAp we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a B boy, I'm a block boy
I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feeling like Pac boy

It's the weekend and I'm creepin' with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, calling women bitches
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And yo girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you blow it up and stop the babysitting?
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids
Back to the Mac, tats on her back
Ass so fat, hit that from the back
When it clap from the back, she clapping it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the track
Fuck yo pack, ASAP where it's at?
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck yo dreams, leave a fuck nigga dreaming
That's sweet and you won't come back front of that

On my aw aw cat (OutKast), daddy fat stacks bitches on my sack
And you know them soak and bitches blow and reefer got me open
Wilding to the morning with my homies, tell 'em where we going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite
