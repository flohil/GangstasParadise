0, D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune),2009,The Blueprint 3 (2009),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Only nigga to rewrite history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin...
Begin... begin
This is anti-AutoTune, death of the ringtone
This ain't for iTunes, this ain't for sing-a-longs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This shit make niggas wanna go and commit felonies
Ah, get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facin' a recession
But the music y'all makin' gon' make it the great depression
Ah, or your lack of aggression
Pull your skirt back down, grow a set men
Ah, ah... nigga this shit violent
This is death of AutoTune, ah moment of silence
La da da da... hey hey hey goodbye
Only nigga to rewrite history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin...
Begin... begin
Hold up, this ain't a number one record
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon
I made this just for Flex and Mr. C,
I want niggas to feel threatened
Stop your blood clot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying
No lyin', your niggas' jeans too tight
Your colors too bright, your voice too light
I might wear black four years straight,
I might bring back Versace shades,
This ain't for Z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 100
This is for Hot 9-7
The shit for clue for Khaled, for we the best and
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of AutoTune, moment of silence...
La da da da... hey hey hey goodbye
Only nigga to rewrite history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin...
Begin... begin
Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy... ay!
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Give this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it
Get me Pharrell to style on this
I just don't need nobody to smile on this
Y'all niggas singin' too much,
Get back to rap, you T-Pain'n too much
Ah, I'm a multi-millionaire
So how is it I'm still the hardest nigga here?
I don't be in the project hallway
Talkin' 'bout how I be in the project all day
That sounds stupid to me,
If you a gangsta, this is how you prove it to me
Nigga, just get violent
This is death of AutoTune, moment of silence
La da da da... hey hey hey goodbye
Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin...

All rhymers with Alzheimer's line up please
All mamis with mind freeze please line up please
All bloggers with comments please, I come in peace
Let's see if we can kill your amnesia by the time I leave
All mamis I hugged before'll vouch for me
Tell 'em 'bout the time on your momma's couch mami
All hustlers who ever, bought an eighth from me
Take this time out, to set the record straight for me
'Member me? Silver bullet, hard top, mentally
They think I'm out of shape so I have to jog they memory
Think with indelible ink, I let the pen go
Verses permanently tattooed serve as mementos
Uh, I'm so mental
My track record speaks for itself, I'm so instrumental
Allow me to rekindle, let's all ""Reminisce"" like Mary did
I think I have to send you a reminder, here it is
Reminder (uh) reminder (uh)
I got it if you needed a reminder (uh)
Reminder (uh) reminder (uh)
I think I better give you a reminder (uh)
Reminder (uh) reminder (uh)
I got it if you needed a reminder (uh)
Reminder (uh) reminder (uh)
'Cause I can give you a friendly reminder (uh)
(Jay-Z)
What the hell have y'all done
... To even have an opinion on what I've been doing
What the hell have y'all won?
... Only thing you can identify with is losing
Ten #1 albums in a row, who better than me?
Only The Beatles, nobody ahead of me
I crush Elvis and his +Blue Suede Shoes+
Made the Rolling Stones seem sweet as Kool-Aid too
'96, '97, '98, '99
2000, 2001 and beyond
'02, '03, '04, '05
'06 and seven, '08, '09
Back-to-back, double plat', I did what you won't
Men lie, women lie, numbers don't
Ain't nothing changed for, me 'cept the year it is
I think I have to send you a reminder, here it is
(Jay-Z)
Do what I've done without crying
In the environment and what y'all did it in without dying my nigga
Then rap like I rap without lying
Then tie 'em both together like I am my nigga
Then write sixteens in between running sixteen bid'nesses
All the while showing these young punks what the bid'ness is
As if, I'ma let you niggaz style on me
As if, now everybody's senile on me
Throwbacks, I threw 'em back, remember those, button-ups?
Young Hov', tell them ordinary Joes +Budden+ up
I destroy your 4-point-ohs
And Benz 500's at all points that OWE!
Now you niggaz 'member me, tell me how could you forget
Back of Johnny's album cover, red and blue Gucci shit
Ain't nothing changed but the year it is
I think I have to send you a reminder, here it is"

You ready B? Let's go get 'em...
(Verse 1: Jay-Z)
Look for me! Young, B
Cruisin' down the westside (high, way)
Doing what we like to do (our, way)
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit' me
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during ""Sex and the City""
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B
(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Verse 2: Jay-Z)
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin' - if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin' this Earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin at Hermes, Burking Bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep
(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Beyoncé)
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (that somebody was me)
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)"

Jigga, uh uh uh, uh-huh
Pa-pa, uh, pa-pa, uh
The G, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi
Drinking saki, it's me, and my mami with the doobie
Cutie, smellin like Tiaka, half-Philippine thing
For now, let's call her Suki, got me this booty bangin'
Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance
A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy
Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ
Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
Cause who's gettin' played is not me
""Surely you jest,"" she said, ""if you thought I was purely
Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me""
I said maturely, ""You right
But better safe than sorry, but for the lovebirds
Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story
To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my Sunshine""
Chorus: Babyface (variations not listed except for first time)
Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ah-ha (say what? uh)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uh, uh, uh)
(Jay-Z), (Foxy Brown)
A year gone, and she seein things most chicks only
Hear in songs (uh-huh) keep in gear phenom
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm
Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)
Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said
(Foxy Brown), (Jay-Z)
I ain't deaf nor blind, niggaz stressin
Hatin' 'cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me
We chose each other, you actin' like you chose me
They oppose you then, they oppose me
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery
Double cross you they got to triple cross me
(I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh
(One more thing:
If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'
(She replied, eyes open wide) Uh
(Put that on everything?) I put that on my life
(Right)
(Jay-Z), (Foxy Brown)
If I needed would you, give me your kidneys? (Uh, uh, fo' sho')
Catch a case you catch it with me? (Mmm, fo' sho')
Pawn your jewlery to come get me? (You better know)
Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (Uh, now that, I don't know)
They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh)
They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? (uh)
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
That you was, throwin' rocks, at the Roof at 12, nigga?)
This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you ballin, from the heavens, or the hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm fallin' myself
Now picture me leavin' you in this cold world, rollin' for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we takin' the belt
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine
Just continue to be my Sunshine (uh)"

What's the problem shorty?
(Shorty)
Yeah whattup man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin' to lock the spot down, holla at me
(Beanie Sigel)
All right; hold on - Hova, line one
(Jay-Z)
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, ""Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life""
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?
(Shorty)
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one
(Jay-Z)
Make out a check for eight hundred dollars

While all these girls up in here? What you gay?

Shake a nigga hand, but shit goddamn
All that (remember me dawg)
Naw I'm drawin' a blank
Ya got me feelin' like a fish, in a fish tank
Just think, if you came to the club
Tryna find a lil' hun for some one night love
'Stead you got a'nuh (anotha) nigga all up in ya mug
You make me uncomfortable thug, go that'a way
And kill the ice grill homes
'Cause I keep enough heat to melt that away
I came in some sweats, I came to get met
Tryna find a chick to make it hard for me to ""next!""

Treat me like a baby, mouth on her breast-es

Go grind on one, damn
Go find you one, go get ya dance on
Go grind on one, man

And all you thugs with ya war stories startin' to bore me
I ain't tryna hear 'bout ya guts and glory
I'm tryna hear B.I.G. and some cuts with N.O.R.E.
And you keep talkin' over the beat like Clue? (""Do you remember"")
Go find somethin' to do
You're a janitor, go find somethin' to screw
Disappear like Copperfield, go cop a feel
Play hide-n-seek with yourself for real
A chick came dressed up just to get messed up
She got her hair done just to get sweated up
Shit, I'm tryna help her out
Why don't you help me out and be out?

To come together
Cause too much black and too much love
Equal forever

Debuts a classical first album four mics
Shoulda gotta five but niggas lack full sight
But I don't giva fuck I ain't do it for the hype
I do it for the hustlas for the ghetto for the polites
For the struggle for those who bubble white
Who fly four by four roofless cars flawless ice
For the pain for y'all to know what it's like
For every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights
For every promise made that never saw the light
I get my own forty acres give me four nights
Four o's a glock forty for the jackets and I'm right
All the four four was suffice
A fourteen year old will look out for the vice
You can sit back and just wait for the flight
Boy will take off like I've been strippin all my life
That's the type of metaphor so right
That let niggas know I was real before the mic
Four front rows had the fur at the fight
No pita on my pita left some room for the divas
And the sweet will meet up if you out for the night
On the rampage champaign pours on the floor
For all those who ain't make it here and loss a life
Wouldn't forget y'all for any price

Not for no fame nor for bright lights

Took for my child to be born
See through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song
I don't deserve you
I harass you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome,"" you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone""
Said: ""Don't embarrass me,"" instead of ""Be mine""

That was your 21st birthday, you mature faster than me
I wasn't ready, so I apologize
I've seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death, I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I
Toyed with you emotions because I was emotionless
I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time you wasted in on all this basic shit
So I apologize
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We're supposed to vacay till our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh till our hearts stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stops
And lets love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over, what if you over my shit?
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
And if my children knew, I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I had to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay
I'm never gonna treat you like I should"

I got 99 (he's got 99 problems) problems, but a bitch ain't one
I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say, ""he's money, cash, hoes""
I'm from the hood, stupid; what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your 
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""fuck critics; you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits; well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas; I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me

If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or 
Bounce on the devil; put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars; I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know what I'm stoppin' you for?""
""Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Do I look like a mind reader, sir?  I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo'?""
""Well, you was doin' fifty-five in a fifty-four"" (uh-huh)
""License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carryin' a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are""
""I ain't steppin out of shit; all my paper's legit""
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
""Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that"" (ha-ha)
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or somethin', somebody important or somethin'?""
""Child, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit""
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the canine comes""

Ah-ah
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me
Now once upon a time, not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
This is not a hoe in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense; try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to (whoo!) clappin' and
He and his boys gon' be yappin' to the captain
And there I go, trapped in the kit-kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' them
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mill' for bail cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin to play the boy like he's saccharine (uh-uh)
But ain't nuttin sweet, 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems; bein' a bitch ain't one; hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me

Uh, uh
Havin' girl problems? I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, and a bitch ain't one.

11,A Ballad for the Fallen Soldier,2002,The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers
I'm about to show you how a hustlers life (this is life man)
And a soldie's life, parallel
And the one thing they got in common is pain (forget about me for a second)
Picture split screen
On one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block (human beings)
Other side you got the soldier getting ready for bootcamp (soldiers)
They're both at war (this is life)
Stay with us
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass
You lost him mama, the wars calling him
Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them
He's a soldier
Rose through the ranks as the head of your house hold
Now it's time to provide bank
Like he's supposed to
Now just remember while he's gone till November
There's part of him growing up
His shirt's soaks up your tears as he holds ya
You heart beatin' so fast speeding his pulse up
Yeah, I know it sucks, life ain't a rose bud
A couple of speed bumps
You gotta take your lumps
Off to bootcamp, the world's facing terror
Bin Laden been happenin' in Manhatten
Crack was anthrax back then, back when
Police was Al'Qaeda to black me
While I was out there hustling sinning with no religion
He was off the wall killing for a living
Days turn to nights, nights turn to years
Years turn to how the fuck we make it in here
My barracks average couple fights a day
Get you locked in a hole won't see the light of day
And I feel like I'm just writing my life away
I never thought shit could end up quite this way
There's a war goingon outside no man is safe from
I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run
I'm here for the purple heart, if I can't take one
For my team or my siblings what's my reason for living
I love my niggas more than anything else
This war's about my family, me needin' the wealth
You don't understand how useless as me we felt
Till you become a five-star general
Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail
P.O.W.'s that's still in the war for real
Your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I've gotta chase (gotta chase it)
If I'm gonna make it (gonna make it)
Your baby boy is getting down
So your baby boy is moving on
I'm gonna make it
Eve if I gotta take it (gotta take it)
Mama said pray your son's becoming a man
This war's taxin' to 'em like Uncle Same
Hear the noise make the right choice, understand
Ever choice that he make he makes it for his fam
It's death before dishonor
And if he's gone you should honor his memory
Don't cry we all gonna die eventually
But if he's locked in the penetentiary send his some energy
They all winners to me
(What's up kid?)"
12,A Dream,2002,The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"[Faith Evans] + (Jay-Z)
Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racin through my head (it was all a dream)
Felt so real to me
This is what was said...
(Jay-Z)
Had a dream I said, bout who he said?
Bout B.I.G. I said, that's big he said
Dig what he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so - breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothin'
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I re-peated what was said
It came to me like a whisper, last evening I said
""What's the deal playboy,"" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead
""More money, more problems, better believe it,"" he said
""Careful what you wish for you might receive it,"" he said
I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, ""Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself""
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
""Just keep doin' your thing,"" he said, say no more

Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, ""Rap Attack,"" Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock till my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? ""Duh-ha, duh-ha""
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the {**""World Trade""**}
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Was it all a dream, was it a dream

Everyday a star is born!
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!)
Everyday a star is born!
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!)
(Verse One: Jay-Z)
I seen Mase do it, I seen 'Ye do it
X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it, clap for 'em
But I'm the Blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it,
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin, I'll applaud him
If he keep goin', pass the torch to him
50 came through, like hurricanes do
I thought I finished his ass at Summerjam Two
I had the Illmatic, on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did a milli, 50 did a milli
'Ye too but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on ""Renegade,"" fuckin' awesome, applaud him
(Chorus: J. Cole) (Jay-Z)
Everyday a star is born!
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!)
Everyday a star is born!
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!)
(Verse Two: Jay-Z)
Hey, Snoop Dogg did, Nelly came down
Facemob kept the ghetto for the H-Town
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches
Drake's up next, see what he do wit it
Rule had a run, couple movie parts
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
Waddup Jeezy? What it do
Ya remind me of us in early '92
OutKast landed, 3 Thou' was ill
Like a male version, of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep +Shook+ it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck wit Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purp' Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run, standing ova- ay!
(Chorus: J. Cole) (Jay-Z)
Everyday a star is born!
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!)
Everyday a star is born!
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!)
(Verse Three: Jay-Z)
And I am one, of one
Can't you see just how long my run?
My rain knew {?} sun-shine
Been a star since I was back in one, time
One time give it up for him
December 4th, a star was born
Clap for him, he went from movin that corner
To, this corner office, so enormous
Heeeeeeeey! Pres Carter
Watchin her get her Monica on all day
Heeeeeeeey!
...Got so many different Monicas, but only one Jay
They come, they go
Some real, some foe
Some friends, some hoes
But no I, goes nowhere, it's Hov
(Chorus: J. Cole) (Jay-Z)
Everyday a star is born!
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!)
Everyday a star is born!
(Clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, clap for 'em, HEY!)
(Verse Four: J. Cole)
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in this broadway lights
Now I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real life saver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber
So, clap for him, then applaud Hov
He gave 'em a platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir
The flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes
When a broke nigga 'proaches
Told ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in
Clap for him

14,A Week Ago,1998,Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life (1998),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"[Jay-Z] Uh-huh
[$Hort] That's right
[Jay-Z] Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
[$Hort] Last week I had everything
[Jay-Z] Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
[$Hort] I had the money... had the cars, the bitches
[Jay-Z] Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
[$Hort] and the jewelry... and then my muthafuckin' niggas started snitchin'
[Jay-Z] Uh-huh, uh uh, yo
[$Hort] Bitch!
Verse 1: Jay-Z
Growin' up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see
Problems, I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint till he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, ""Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?""
He said, ""Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home.""
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
The crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
I said, ""The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on.""
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe cause niggas is 2-faced
And they show the other side when they catch a new case
It's on
Chorus: Too $hort, Jay-Z
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what, 7 days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you droppin' names
Uh-huh, uh-huh It was all good just a week ago
Verse 2: Jay-Z
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar now you cryin' for bail
Seventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill
I could bail out and blow trial and come around on Appeal
Had niggas thinkin' I was from Uptown for real
I had so much hustle plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight the round 30
Freezin on them corners still holdin' my crack
Lookin' up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack
You tell them feds I said I'm never goin' back
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what, 7 days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you droppin' names
Uh-huh, uh-huh It was all good just a week ago
Verse 3: Jay-Z
The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things
All this after a week in the bang
I'm mad at myself 'cause I didn't spot the weak and lame
I woulda bet the house you wouldn't speak a thang
Nigga this was the oath, to the top of broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We sposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry
That's right, the same game that make you mad could make you die
It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who woulda thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up like, ""This is my dad?""
The labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail nigga, just minus the bars
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what, 7 days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you droppin' names
Uh-huh, uh-huh It was all good just a week ago
(Too $hort)
Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitchin'
We was one step away from takin' this crack money
And recyclin' it through the ghetto's
And buildin' back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitchin on each other
I got partners doin' 15-20
Wouldn't of been doin' shit if you didn't snitch!
Bitch!
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good
Shut your mouth
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
It sure will do a lot for you
Believe that baby
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house main
You know I got it
Got it goin' on
We got the money
Ain't got nothin' to do with crime baby
But I'm recognizing

Coach bag lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surrounded ya feet in Joan and Davis and Charles Jourdan
I keep ya dove, but love
You know these hoes be, making me weak
Y'all know how it goes, B, and so I creep
I been sinnin' since you been playin' with Barbie and Ken, and
You can't change a players game in the ninth inning
The chrome rims spinning keeps 'em grinning
So I run way the fuck up in 'em and wrinkle they face like linen
I play hard un-till they say ""God, he's keepin' it real, Jigga stay hard""
Naw, don't even trip, I never slip
Nigga, get a grip, what you don't see is what you get
Weapons concealed, what the fuck y'all feel
When ya niggas play sick we can all get ill
(What the deal?)
Right, right, yo
Ain't no stoppin' this no lie
Promise to stay monogamous, I try
But love you know these hoes be, makin' me weak
Y'all know how it goes, B, so I stay deep
(Foxy Brown)
What up boo
Just keep me laced in the illest snakes
Bankrolls and shit, back rubs in the French tub
Mackin' this bitch, wifey nigga
So when you flip that coke 'member the days you was dead broke
But now you stylin', I raised you
Basically made you, into a don, flippin' weight, heroin and shit
You know the pussy is all that
That's why I get baguettes, five carats and all that
From Dolce Gabbana, to H. Bendel
I'm ringin' bells, so who the playa
I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor-made, so we can lay up in the shade
Reminiscin' on how I fuck the best and shit
'Specially when I'm sippin' Baileys
Don't give a fuck 'bout how you move with them other mamis
I push the Z, eatin' shrimp scampi
With rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who ya wife was
I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit when you was in leathers and bullshit Berettas
And E classes with Mo' in the glasses
Shows in Cali with all the flavors suede Bally's
Now all your mens is up in ya Benzes
High post, I swear you be killing me
Playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry 'bout them other chicks
Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spinnin' that bitch
I tripped a little, when you was up north
Ya commissary stay pilin'
How you livin' large on a island
All them collects had me vexed, but when you come home
Knew I was comin' off with half of them checks
Now we on da rise, your diamond mami with the slanted eyes
Holdin' this grip, cocked the ?encleeque? and shit
Fucks no, I see half of the dough (whoa, whoa)
Made you into a star, pushin' hundred thousand dollar cars
(Chorus 2x fadin' out)
(Adlibs during the chorus)
Uh, what nigga
Foxy Brown, (uh, uh, uh, Jay-Z y'all) Jay-Z niggas
Cocked the ?encleeque? and shit (That's right, whoa, whoa)

[Jay-Z]:
London, England, south of France
And all points between they know about your man
Konichiwa ladies when I'm out in Japan
I'm a Tokyo giant like Ichiro, I am
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw
Spot me the hotel, the Cap' or Capri
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like weed
Your man'll stand Manta Ray, handlin' a steak
And handlin' the modern stand about five eight
Five nine, fine wine, fine dine, either that
Or I'm mixin' in Switzerland, tryin' to buy time
Ballin' out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali
Brunchin' at the Four Seasons, off the heezy
When it's back home nigga back to the zone
Nigga back to the books to the rhymes that took me

Brooklyn bombers (same song)

Said it's all love, Shore club, M-I-A
Party at bungalow eight, when I stay
Pool look like a hundred Beyonce's
A couple fiances, I'm the new DeVante
Come talk to me, mami in the Yves-Saint Laruent
I hope she ain't too young
Only twenty-one and older let another nigga mold her
I'm just tryin' to show her how a baller and a roller
Sleep in one place, tell the pilot keep the engine
Runnin' then I wake up in Martha's Vineyard
St. Bart's this year, I think I'm gon' spend Christmas
Reminiscin' about the time my mom couldn't spend Christmas
Now I'm gon' spend her on her own little wish list
Anywhere in the world, anywhere for my girl
Forever my lady, blind crippled and crazy
A ticket and your favorite CD, sweet Sadie
[LaToiya Williams]:
Sadie, Sadie, don't you know I love you sweet Sadie
Sadie, all around the world
[Jay-Z]:
Said it ain't where you from yo it's where you at
Real niggas out in Brooklyn, some niggas don't clap
It's real killers out in Cali, some niggas just act
Hollywood like they out the hood, it's all to the good
Real players in the D-Twa, some of them throwed
Slackin' on they mackin', rest haven for hos
Real pranksters in the Chi, most of them real folks
Disciplined gangstas, come on Charlie I know
Shit it ain't about your city or borough
It's 'bout if you really as thorough
And if you are, holla at your boy
I put my hand on my heart, that means I feel you
Real recognize real and you lookin' familiar
I'm a Bed-Stuy nigga but I do it to death
I promise I'm as St. Thomas homie eatin' at Chef's
One-twelve, A-T-L, the sun up yet?
Then we party like the sun don't set

And all... I... need is a chick to hold a jimmy like
Meth and Mary, like, Marvin and Tammi, unnnh...
Now understands we can't be stopped
From blowin' Swisher Sweets outta candy drops
Like we underground kings, ridin' dirty
A nigga been focused since I said hi to 30 (what up?)
Young niggas y'all can't hurt me
Better watch and observe me
And learn how to earn better, I burn cheddar
I set fire to your empire
I blow smoke in your face, burn rubber off the rim tires

I got a little two-two I call 'er Peggy Sue
When I'm off in the club she fit right in my shoe (woo!)
Gotta switch her to my waist, just in case (uh huh)
A clown wan' flip gotta reach for my bitch
Wanna act out a movie I could give you a clip (buk!)
But no adlibbin' nigga stick to the script
Now all... I... need is a high-priced lawyer
'Cause it's foul ways nowadays everybody saw you
And they comin' to court too, I thought you knew
Can't even steal on a nigga muhfuckas'll sue
In this time and age, 'cause real muhfuckas'll do
When I'm surrounded by squeal muhfuckas like you
But real niggas don't fret 'cause the number one crew?
R to the O to the C comin' true
Listen...
The cream too long, my team too strong
Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone
Y'all niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on (see y'all)
Y'all whole block deserted, y'all fiends are gone (bye bye!)
The whole Roc is jumpin', we reached our zenith
Got fiends throwin' up on themself like Willy Beaman [giggle]
Any given Sunday gunplay's optional
However niggas want it like Soul II Soul (however do you waaaaant it)
Whoever got hops get blocked go to the hole
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit
Plus the jab is sick, and it's that quick
Left hand'll lean 'em like a little past six
Now run along wit'cha little ass hits
Read my rap sheet nigga, THREE CLASSICS
Shut ya bumba' got A-Rod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump, I leave you relaxed
In the hospital lookin' at F*U*C*K for months
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk
And the fleece got free and pee-pee on the steps...
We've got no respect
No law or governin' why you fuckin' wit' him?
Matta'fact, why you fuckin' wit' them?

20,Allure,2003,The Black Album (2003),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Young! It's da life...
Once again it's da life! Yess...
(I don't know why... I get so high on)
It's intoxicatin man... y'all don't know why you do what you do
(Get so high on (Yess).. get so high (C'mon) - high off the life)
(Verse 1: Jay-Z)
The allure of breakin' the law
It's always too much for me to ever ignore
I gotta thing for them big body Benzes... it dulls my senses
I'm in love with a V-dub engine
Mann I'm high off life- fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemar Piguet wrists
My women friend get tennis bracelets
Trips ta Venice, get their winters replaced with...
The sun, it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man it's just da game, I just play it to play it
Put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without sayin' a word, the ghettos got a mental telepathy
Man my brother hustled, so naturally, up next is me
But what perplexes me
Shit I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starrin' role in ""Hovito's Way""
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shavin coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doin' the most... oh no!
But every time I felt that was that, it called me right back
It called me right back, man it called me right back - oh no!
(Verse Two)
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinkin' distilled vodka
Till I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toupee
Mix the water, with the soda
Turn the pot up make a souflee
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way
I'm livin' proof that crime do pay
Say hooray to the bad guy, and all the broads
Puttin' cars in they name for the stars of the game
Puttin' 'caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train
All in the name of love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back, everything that they claimed
Or even the worst pain is the dis-tress
Learnin you're the mis-tress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mis-trust
Now it gets tough to ever love a-gain
But the allure of the game, keeps callin your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in every cities and Tiffany Lanes
We all hustlers, in love with the same thang
(Verse Three)
I never felt more alive than ridin' shotgun
In Cline's green 5 until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
What the game did to my pulse, with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a lightbulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth, addicted to the floss
And doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost...
And I can't explain why, I just love to get high
Drink life, smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dyin' young, leavin' a good lookin' corpse
'Course
Once again it's the life!
I said it's the life!
Once again it's the life - oh no!
(I don't why I) why I (get so high on)
Get so (get so high on) uh-huh
(Get so high - high off the life!)
Hahahahahahaha - woo!"

Don't they know that I'm gone?
They know I'm space shuttle level
They need ox-y-g-g-g-gen
Don't they know that they borin'?
Don't they know that I yawn
Only time they excitin' is when they're mentionin' Shawn
You seen ""Single White Female"" when she dyed her hair blond?
Sometimes I look at these rappers, the movie remind me of them
Somebody turn these boys off
Don't they know that I'm on
Can't they see that it's foolish to try to kill me with songs?
What the fuck are they Lauryn? you ""Killing Me Softly""
You talk me to death, only thing you could do to him
I opened the door for them, what else could I do?
These niggas want me to walk for them
But somebody talk to them
Before I go off on them...
(Verse 2: Jay-Z)
I taught 'em 'bout fishscale, they want me to fish for them
They want me to catch, clean... and cook up the dish for them
All of this just for them or they got a diss for him
They want me to disappear, like it's gon' shift for them
They say that I'm in the way, they want me to sit for them
But what they admitting is, they ain't got shit for him
And really the fact is, we not in the same bracket
Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets
Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches
So how am I in the way, what is it I'm missin'?
Nigga I been missin', nigga I been gone
The shit that you just witnessin' end, I been on
And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it
Everybody could tell you how to do it, they never did it
Now these niggas is mad, oh, they call me a camel
But I mastered the drought, what the fuck, I'm an animal
Half man, half mammal
My sign is a Sag, this is just what I planned to do
Oh don't be maddddd
I'm in the Hall already, on The Wall already
I'm a work of art, I'm a Warhol already
On another level, on another plane already
H-O-V, I got my own lane, already (already)
...I done cooked up ""The Roc"" already
So why the fuck can't y'all get hot already? (already)
Put your name in the pot already
Niggas compare me with Biggie and 'Pac already (already)
Like I'm gone already
And I am, nigga I'm ""Already Home"" already (already)
If y'all can't already see
I ain't worried bout y'all 'cause I'm already me
Yeah... do you already
Enough with the complainin', boo-hoos already
...Eat food already
Ain't nothin' given, you gotta claim your shoes already
Yeah

I'm already at the finish line with the flag wavin'

Then came the dawn, and I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all that's all that's all baby
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
But there's always...
That's all that's all...
This is the shit you dream about with the homie steamin' out
Back-back-backing them Beemer's out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playin' this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinkin' bout Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
Ain't nothin' wrong with aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of baggin' snidd-ow the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope not to make her a widow
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
Its just American dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
Its just American dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
American dreamin'
But there's always...
That's all that's all...
Now see, the life's right there
And it seems right there
It's not quite near,
And it's not like we're professionals movin' the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! got a connect? No!
Who under Heaven know how to be successful
Need a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, it's all in the stars
It's like Tony LaRussa
On how you play your cards
You all ain't fucking with me!
The ironies are
And at all costs better before he was bars
Now lets start, on your mark
Get set, lets go-get out the car!
Going in circles, it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up, Muttley, you're dreamin' again
Your own reality show, the season begins
Step One in this process, scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince 'em that you not from the Precinct
Please speak slow, 'cause he no speakey no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
If your money is straight, he's gonna give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well...
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am i? I wish you HEALTH
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs, when the jackets is schemin'
And the cops is comin', you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time

So it's plain to see where my whole plan come from
American dream, I'm living the live still
The way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding army jacket lining
40 below timbs on, getting my M's on
My best friends gone, I seen bad days
Still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige reminisce on
I hear his voice in my head like nigga live on
So I get on that fly shit, I been on
Spin on corners in enzo with the rims on, but for the info
Foffin on endo-nesia give me amnesia, I ease up
That right I'm high nigga, I want the sky
The world when I'm done, I'm a give it to my sons
Let them live it up, spilt it up, uh
Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame
A list of hit next to all my names I came
If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow
And they force foreclose on the house
And auction off all my cars
Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed in beamer
Took trips aboard, got mobbed in Sardinia
In Ibiza I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy
They wanna piece of my love, now they wanna ya boy
Like Mike in his prime, Billie Jean the goddamn boy ain't mine
And the the Roc break up had people losing hope
Can't lie they had Muhammed Hovi, on the ropes
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-gos'
Throwing the diamond up repping the logo, rose gold, rose flow
I'm ok though, what don't kill me makes me stronger than before so
Here we go and I'm not domino
When it all falls down I'm like Kanye's jaw
I might break but I don't fold, till I hold the sky in my hand
Yeah that's my goal
Then I bid you Freddy Adu, prodigal child
Y'all not ready for the future, then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle
My name will be viewed such

Mama's lil baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment
Nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me
Bloom for your wisdom for your womb
For the roof over my head
For my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said:
""Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them""
Thanks for the days you kept me breathin'
When my asthma was bad and my chest was weezin'
Thanks for the look of love
Just as I was leavin'
Some nights, you thought that I wouldn't come back
I left you grievin'
Thanks for holdin' down the household
When times were bad
As a man, I apoligize for my dad
When the rent was due
You would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn't the life meant for you
You're a queen
You deserve the cream
Everything that gleams
Everything that shines
Everything that's mine
I'd risk everything
Oh, I'd risk everything
Yes I'd do anything, anything
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
Oh, I'd risk everything
Yes I'd do anything, anything
Anything for you
Dear nephews
I'm writin' this, wit no pen or a pad
And I'm signin' it
Ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look at before when your feelin' bad
I'm right there
For when you cut to when you peelin' a scab
If it comes a time
And you ain't feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body
Don't wait for nobody
Don't follow no nigga
That's hoe shit man
Stand on your own two
Do your shit man
The world is yours
Some girls are nice
Some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew
Do what works for you
Standin' back away from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass
Then you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one
And whatever is said take it
How they want
A closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it's code red
Or if you're wrong, my nigga
You're my nephew
Fuck it we get it on my lil nigga
I'd risk everything
Oh, I'd risk everything
Yes I'd do anything, anything
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
Oh, I'd risk everything
Yes I'd do anything, anything
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
Oh, I'd risk everything
Yes I'd do anything, anything
Anything for you
I'd risk everything

Fuck all this pretty Shawn Carter shit nigga, HOV
(Verse 1: Jay Z)
Shawn was on that gospel shit
I was on the total fuckin' opposite
Shit, stuff a million dollars in the sock drawer
That's a war chest in case you need your chest knocked off
Y'all be talkin' crazy under them IG pictures
So when you get to hell you tell 'em Blanco sent ya
I can't take no threats, I got a set of twins
Those were just the words you'll never hear again
For the final time you don't believe these fools
I've never seen a worker rock so many jewels
I've never seen the runner with so many cars
Y'all couldn't stop me, you're not as tough as you say you are
My advice is just don't be too nice to niggas
Just set the price so niggas'll live your life, my nigga
Once upon a time in the projects
Shawn was in flight mode, I bought a Pyrex
I was in fight mode and now it's ""fuck me, mijo""
I was movin' them kilos, help you move your peoples
Sometimes you need your ego, gotta remind these fools
Who they effin' with, and we got FN's too
Before we had A&R's, we had AR's too
We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do
We still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did
Emory passed you niggas and he did a bid
Ty Ty jumped over niggas and he's like 5'6""
Got the heart of a giant, don't you ever forget
Don't you never forget, Jigga got this shit poppin'
I pulled out the pot when we was outta options

29,Beach Chair,2006,Kingdom Come (2006),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Life is but a dream to me I don't wanna wake up
30 odd years without having my cake up
So I'm bout my paper
24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we got a beat here
Life is but a beach chair (chair, chair, chair)
Went from having shabby clothes
To crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me (are you happy Hov?)
I just hope I'm hearing right
Karma's got me fearing life
Khalik are you praying for me
See I got demons in my past so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct than the child shall have to pay
For the sins of the father
So I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays
In hopes that she'll be O.K.
And when I'm no longer here
To shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter
And a new beach chair
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream to me
Gun shots sing to these
Other guys but lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dyin'
I'm afraid of not tryin'
Everyday hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net
No I never been on Myspace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space
In this world of fly girls
Cut throats in diamond cut ropes I twirls
Business round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope in ones grind
Some said ""Hov how you get so fly?""
I said from not being afraid to fall out the sky
My physical's a shell so when I say farewell
My soul will find an even higher plane to dwell
So fly you shall so have no fear
Just know that life is but a beach chair (chair, chair, chair)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream can't mimic my life
I'm the thinnest cut slice
Intercut, the Winner's Cup
Where winter's rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner... nice
This is Jay every day no compromise
No compass comes with this life just eyes
So to map it out you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you chica
The corazón is what brought us home
In great shape like Heidi Klum, maricon, I am on
Permanent vaca', life is but a beach chair
Song's like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So till she's here
And she's declared
The heir
I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print a map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes
So you won't lose scent
I'll make a stink for you to think
I ink these verses
Full of prose so you won't get conned out of 2 cents
My last will and testament I leave my heir
My share of Roc-a-fella Records and a shiny new beach chair
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream

I'm Ringling brothers Barnum Bailey with the pies,
No matter how you slice it,
I'm your mother fucking guy
And just like a B-boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot,
Still come back beige.
Whether right or south paw,
Whether pot or a jar
Whip it around,
It still comes back hard.
So easily do a W-H-I-P,
My repitition with riches will bring the kilo business,
I got creole C-O bitches, for my niggas who slipped,
Became prisoners,
Treat's taped to the visitors.
You already know what the business is
Unnecessary commissary, boy we live this shit.
Niggas Wanna bring the 80s back,
That's okay with me, that's where they made me at.

I write my name in the history books, hustling in the hall

But I wouldn't be the guy who's rhymes it is that I'm in
No pay no profit,
P, I'll repeat it to show you where the pot is
Cherry M3s with the top back
Red and green Gs all on my hat
North beach leathers,
Matching Gucci sweater,
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game?
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster
Blame Oliver north and Iran-Contra
I ran contraband that they sponsored

Feds, they like wack rappers.
Try as they may they couldn't get me on the hook
D.A. wanna indict me,
Cause fish scales in my veins like a Pisces

Turn one into two like a Siamese twin when it end
Imma stand as a man never dying on my knees,
Last of a dying breed

Mickey fed me, and he dressed me
Eric fought me, made me tougher
Love you for that my nigga no matter what brah
Marcy raised me; and whether right or wrong
Streets gave me all I write in the song
Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me, had me skippin school
Valencia's boyfriend Vovo had me makin' moves
Momma raised me, pop I miss you
God help me forgive him I got some issues
Mickey cleaned my ears, and he shampooed my hair
Eric was fly - shit, I used to steal his gear
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong
Yeah it's goin' past fast - let's move along
Kitchen table - that's where I honed my skills
Jaz made me believe the shit was real
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee
Clark sought me out, Dame believed
Primo laced me, Ski did too
""Reasonable Doubt"" - classic, shoulda went triple
Momma loved me, pop left me
Grandma dressed me, plus she fed me
Banana puddin', what's in the hood then

Followed by three more boys and then a baby girl
Momma loved me, T.T. Uncle Jay
Loves you to death won't let no trouble come your way
Oh, can't forget my man down in Maryland
He's gone till November, how can I not remember?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra
And your son too - there's nothin' I won't do
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased cuffed and subdued me
Talked to me rudely; 'cause I'm young rich and I'm black
And live in a movie, not livin' by rules
New rap patrollin the city, follow my crews
Bleek you're still with me - nigga what did I say?
The time is comin'; you one hit away
Beans I ain't tryin' to change you - just give you some game
To make the transition, from the street to the fame

Jay-Z this, Jay-Z that (Jay-Z won't hold my hand no more)
Jay-Z this, Jay-Z that
Jay-Z that, Jay-Z this (Jay-Z won't give me no money)
Get off Jay-Z dick
What y'all niggas get front page articles, y'all mention Jay-Z name
(This thing on?) Jay-Z, Jay-Z, in Jay-Z news
I understand what y'all trying to do
I brought the flutes this time, though
I unleashed the flutes on them, guru
Gimme some more music in the headphone
Let's get the proceedings proceeding this evening
Let's do this thing (let's do it right this time)
C'mon
H, O V A
I got my mojo back baby, oh behave
Naw, naw, don't be afraid
Y'all and your articles, hard to spit at Jay
Y'all from afar threw thoughts my way
What you thought, I would naught have nothing to say? Nope!
Y'all fell into the booby trap
I set the trap just to see dude react, and now
And now you'se can't leave
You opened the door god, I'm at you annually
And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is
But you can't give cred to anything dude says
Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head
(Shorty!) It's time to wake up the dead
You sound a little naive in them articles that I read
H, O V A
The Blueprint 2 baby, on the way
H, O V A
I got my mojo back baby, oh behave
(Jay-Z)
Can't y'all, see that he's fake, the rap version of TD jakes
Prophesizing on your CDs and tapes
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you want to place your faith?
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line
Donating proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed myself?
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help
They call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude
To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
These dudes is all politics, depositing checks
They put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype
Cause the nigga wear a coofie, it don't mean that he bright
Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write
Is it ""Oochie Wally Wally"" or is it ""One Mic""?
Is it ""Black Girl Lost"" or shorty owe you for ice?
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose, for even in defeat
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens it up for me
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though
Saving me the hassle of speaking to half of these assholes
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history
Who you know flow vicious as me?
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov
I get the spoils cause the victor is me (me, nigga)
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be
The street dreamin', all y'all niggas living through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgetting you emcee
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob, listen God you a flea
And the little homey Jungle is a garden to me
What's the problem B? You not as hard as me
Nigga hard as we, nigga R O C, nigga
That's why they follow me, they feel my pain and my agony, nigga
I won't rest till you on one knee
You want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga
Until you on one knee, you want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga"

Seems we don't have a care
Sex makes you say I'm sorry

Best flow, Most consistent, Realest stories
Most charisma, I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter
Holla
I jog in the graveyard
Spar in the same ring
Now it's house by the building
Where Malcolm X was slain
I spring train in the winter
Round early December
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me ""Hova""
I'm far from being God
But I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds who in the nerves is sleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one end
I am ""focused man""
And I'm not afraid of death
And I'm going all out
I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (run)
Pull up in a drop (pull up)
Push up on my money (push up)
I'm in great shape dunny
I keep jacks jumping thirty six sets

We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles
Y'all ain't real
That's y'all Achilles Heel
Same routine when you see me you know the drill

Steam a nigga schemin on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream
""Yeah, bring it on... bring it on..."" --> Fat Joe

Nigga, how you figure... (how you figure)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, aiyyo
Peep the style and the way the cops sweat us (uh-huh)
The number one question is can the Feds get us (uh-huh)
I got vendettas in dice games against ass betters (uh-huh)
And niggaz who pump wheels and drive Jettas
Take that witcha...
(Notorious B.I.G.)
... Hit ya, back split ya
Fuck fist fights and lame scuffles
Pillow case to your face, make the shell muffle
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle
Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated
Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug related
Most hate it...
(Jay-Z)
... Can't fade it
While y'all pump Willie, I run up in stunts silly
Scared, so you sent your little man's to come kill me
But on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin soft on him
What's ya name?
(Notorious B.I.G.)
... Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra
Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet
Tryin' to push 700's, they ain't made them yet

No more, Mister, Nice Guy, I twist your shit
The fuck back with them pistols, blazin'
Hot like cajun
Hotter than even holdin' work at the Days Inn
With New York plates outside
Get up outta there, fuck your ride

Keep your hands high, shit gets steeper
Here comes the Grim Reaper, Frank Wright
Leave the keys to your In-tegra (That's right)
Chill homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me
You're holdin' more drugs than a pharmacy, you ain't harmin me
So pardon me, pass the safe, before I blaze the place

Better look on map, Besides, mi nah like to eye fight
Mi nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (CHRIST!)
But if a man test my Stuy, I promise he won't like my reply
Boom Bye Bye like Buju I'm crucial
I'm a Brooklyn boy I may take some gettin' use to
Chain snatchin, ain't have it, gotta get it
Same shitted, from Brownsville to Bainbrididge
Fatherless child, mama put double shifts
So the number runners was the only one I hanged widith
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fidith
Fit no orangutans piddeals ciddaps like orange's I'm dangerous

Awww man, I'm Jackie Robinson
Except when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, lucky we, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets I'm the Black Branch Ricky
From Brooklyn corners, burnin branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie, Brooklyn, hippie
I pity, the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With long history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returnin, tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half orphan, mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did, still I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this!

While I'm doin' my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge is the consequence
Once pretend now I paid my dues
Risk takers we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin
(BROOK-LYN!) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick workin like we good color
Rip it to the core, underneath it or we oughta
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step one step give it up more
All this stuff and the streets are a mess
With big ass dreams and a sick death wish
Probably like the commercials says
Kill the voice screamin in my head

If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it - could ya
See yourself with a nigga workin harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a BALLA? So you can shop and tear the MALL UP?

We invite you to, somethin' epic y'all know?(something, something)
Well we hustle out of a sense of, hopelessness
Sort of a desperation (live nigga)
Through that desperation, we 'come addicted
Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose (everything to gain)
So we offer you, well, we offer our lives, (right)
What do you bring to the table?
While I'm watchin every nigga watchin me closely
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clap from closed feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see, from sellin 'caine
Till brains was fried to a fricaisse, can't lie
At the time it never bothered me, at the bar
Gettin' my thug on properly, my squad and me
Lack of respect for authority, laughin' hard
Happy to be escapin poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks, expectation
For dips, for percipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more, Big Willie my game has grown prefer you call me William
Illin for revenues, Rayful Edmund-like
Channel 7 news, round seven jews, hand dead on the mic
Forgettin all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure
Lock my body can't trap my mind, easily
Explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin
The in excess rental, don't be fooled my game is mental
We both out of town dog, what you tryin' to get into?
Viva, Las Vegas, see ya, later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no fraud Willie's present gambling they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin margaritas
Ge-ge-geyeah, can I live?
Can I live?
My mind is infested, with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity, my crew and me
Commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifested intangible goods
Platinum Rolexed it, we don't lease
We buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation, EXPLODE
On detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends gotta do it, even righteous minds go through this
True this, history school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and, watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous, dreams of
Gettin' cream let's do this, against T-D-S
So I keep one eye open like, C-B-S, ya see me

Speed off, officer told me to turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher, then return the devils fire

My subliminal flows create criminal O's
Sing along if you with me, till the end of the road
I'm cynical when in the view of the public
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you?

Why is it? why don't y'all try to visit the neighboorhoods I lived in
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central
Where cops lock you more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth
And all I see is life cycle just repeatin' itself
Ran into shorty boppin' down the ave

He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said

Aiyyo there's money I there I just gotta have
When I catch up to these feinds I'm'a knock 'em on they ass
Not to brag, sometimes I look at life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not a ???
When I backed out, let one one, let the barrel turn
Holla at you faggots that it's my block to burn
That credit you dead it, I know heads gettin' annoyed and knew all
About a dope feind before reading donald goings
Flipping boying, using the right cut
One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump
This slab gotta re-up and rebag, blend it in with the raw
Bubble it fast cop more, once I get it I got it I lock it
Nobody pop shit, selling twenties on my block bitch
For some blacktop shit
What you want nigga, what you want nigga
What you want, what you want nigga

Tryin' to win in the construction Timbs yo
Can I live...

Jay-Z: Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella y'all, it don't stop
We about to change this game here
Check my pockets, ain't nothing but game there
I remain without fear
Keep the lames clear, and the cats that's all about scratch remain here
On top of this Metropolis
My name is like a square
Dropped off every tier
Now y'all can swear to Jay
Heard it the other day
Through the missive, peep how they script it
We got to hit you every night before we hit the lights it's type addictive
Need cash to live with, the beat goes on
Everyday is a hustle, the heat grows on
Funny thing happens when years of chasing money unfolds
And the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old
Niggaz stay low, like six bowls of shit and gold
And watch for hoes with form fitting clothes
And I hope you shine
See many wrinkles and enough memories to last you two lifetimes
Can't knock the hustle
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
Baby one day you'll be a star
Check this
In a man's world need a girl to touch something
Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something
If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something
When I get home, Then it's on
Girl just crack those shaved legs like Grade A eggs
Love the way you behave and beg
Moans, turn to hollers and screams as we zone like a college team
Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens two-twenty six
Life with me, consists of a lot of things
Chicks in your ear, kickin' dirt, 'cause you got hotter rings
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness
Remind them freak chicks to stay out my bizziness
Know they can't love it, trips to L.A. with no luggage
Came back with six bags struggling
In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me
Steaks still warm on me
But until the last day, I'm the one who's crazy
'Cause that's the way you making me feel (can't knock the hustle)
I don't want no romance, I just want the chance
Can't knock the hustle for real
Ever since you retired, working alongside those live wires
Been in this rap biz with fake nigs you know liars
I guess I'm biased, what I talk about I live
These rap dudes can flip, but some of them ain't even rhyming for chips
What part of the game is this
Seems brainless, on tours with whores that's what I'm saying I miss
Cats that go all out for their gold plaques
Starting out with four jacks, ended up with Gold Ac's
Bet your love collapses if my funds get trapped
On the weight of me through you, screw you
Gun blew you, I didn't want to choose you
Run through you like UH, EXCUSE YOU!
But that's my cash, I understand you hustle
That's my cash, you don't understand
Let my dough flash, you can show it love
Like a rap star in front of the club
But don't knock the hustle
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
Baby one day you'll be a star

With that East Side
That dance, uh
Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly
(Verse 1: JAY-Z)
Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot
You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your Roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
'Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep
(Chorus: Frank Ocean)
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams
(Verse 2: JAY-Z)
I sat down with Prince, eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy had 'Slave' on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't big bro me, don't ""Big Homie""
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful
(Chorus: Frank Ocean)
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare

I paid the cost to be the boss to floss this hard
I can recall a year ago I almost lost this job
All y'all remember is the part about me parkin the hog
What about all them days I was walkin' my dogs?
Barkin at broads, but they never hollered back
And if they did all they said was, ""Where dem dollaz at?""
Imagine, bein skinny growin' up around broader cats
The quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats
Until I got a gat and loudly start poppin' back
Round the way, niggaz called me Bobby Bouchete

How y'all gon' stick me up, take my jewels away
Pull out your gat, car jack me take my cruise away

I gotta cock back and pull the trigger first

I made my way hustlin, I don't owe niggaz shit
I'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped
Cats I played skelly with? Niggaz done flipped
I keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip
Two in the stash, one come up when I shift
I keep one under the chair where I sit
I even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch

I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He wanna, run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle, nobody wanna be like Michael
Where I'm from, just them niggaz who banned from a gun

Sixteen tryin' to graduate to pushin quarters y'all
I ain't gon' sweat him I'ma let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggaz gon' see

And breakin day, and chasin crackers up the block for my pay
I'm stayin fresh, so chickens check
I'm tryin' to step up to the next level, pushin Vettes to the Jets
Diamonds reflect from the sun, directly in your equilibirum
And stunned I'm waitin for my day to come

Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breakin' my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart

I should take him in back of the building and blaze him

Uh-oh, this nigga Jay he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
And had I, not been so high I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him, as if I loved him

It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that somethin' was about to go down

As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind

He never learned so in turn I'm kidnapping his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
So I kept feeding her money till her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee, we used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm trying to rock this bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears, know she's wishing we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be
In time, I'll take away your miseries and make 'em mine, D'Evils...
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Illuminati wants my mind, soul and my body,
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Secret Society, tryin' to keep an eye on me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Illuminati wants my mind, soul and my body,
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
My flesh, no nigga could test
My soul is possessed by D'Evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The exorcist, got me doing skits like Homie
You don't know me, but the whole world owe me
Strip!
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothing nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquors invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me
I can't be held accountable, D'Evils beating me down, boo
Got me running with guys, making G's, telling lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers
Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'Evils...
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Illuminati wants my mind, soul and my body,
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Secret Society, tryin' to keep an eye on me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
Illuminati wants my mind, soul and my body,
Dear God, I wonder can you save me"

Rock... on, Roc-A-Fella y'all
The saga continues
Ah, who wanna bet us that we don't touch leathers
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous all the et ceteras
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggaz just rhyme
By the ounce dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show; you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck em, they hate a nigga lovin' his life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital days, reflectin when my man laid up
On the Uptown high block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin, this is a minor set back
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get back
That made him smile though his eyes said, ""Pray for me""
I'll do you one better and slay these niggaz faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothin' but time
I had near brushes, not to mention three shots
Close range, never touched me, divine intervention
Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ta Ta
Down in Nevada, ha ha, Poppa, word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
Potnah, I'm still spendin money from eighty-eight... what?
Geyeah, know what? I'll make...
You and your wack man's fold like bad hands
Roll like Monopoly, advance you copy me
Like white crystal, I gross the most
At the end of the fiscal year than these niggaz can wish to
The dead presidential, canidate
With the sprinkles and the presidential, ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime flees my mind
All sneak thieves and playa haters can shine
But until then I keep the trillion cut diamonds shinin brilliant
I'll tell you half the story, the rest you fill it in
Long as the villain win
I spend Japan yen, attend major events
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin
J-A-Y hyphen, controllin, manipulatin
I got a good life man, pounds and pence
Nuff dollars make sense, while you ride the bench
Catch me swinging for the fence
Dead Presidents, ya know
Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh, so be it
The Soviet, The Unified Steady Flow
You already know, you light I'm heavy roll, heavy dough
Mic macheted your flow, your paper falls slow
Like confetti, mines a steady grow, bet he glow
Pay five dead it from blow, better believe I have
Eleven sixty to show, my doe flip like Tae-Kwon
Jay-Z The Icon, baby, you like Dom, maybe this Cristal's
To change your life huh, roll with the winners
Heavy spenders like hit records: Roc-A-Fella
Don't get it corrected this shit is perfected
From chips to chicks just drivin' a Lexus
Make it without your gun, we takin' everything you brung
We cake and you niggaz is fake and we gettin' it done
Crime Family, well connected Jay-Z
And you fake thugs is Unplugged like MTV
I empty three, take your treasure, my pleasure

Bla-ouw!

60,December 4th,2003,The Black Album (2003),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"(Intro: Gloria Carter)
Shawn Carter was born December 4th
Weighing in at ten pounds, eight ounces
He was the last of my four children
The only one who didn't give me any pain, when I gave birth to him
And that's how I knew, that he was a special child
""Hi baby, what's wrong? You look like, you've lost your best friend
Tell me, is it something that I've done again?
You look like, you've lost your best friend
Tell me..""
(Verse One: Jay-Z)
They say they never really miss you till you dead or you gone
So on that note I'm leavin' after this song
See you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnus Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me, a more sicker MC and my momma would claim
At ten pounds when I was born I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose was on purpose, I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
Now I'm just scratchin the surface 'cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on
(Interlude: Gloria Carter)
Shawn was a very shy child growing up
He was into sports, and a funny story is
At four, he taught himself how to ride a bike
A two-wheel at that, isn't that special?
But, I noticed a change in him... when me and my husband, broke up
(Verse Two: Jay-Z)
Now all the teachers couldn't reach me and my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein me SO!
With disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game, fuck the world, my defense came
Then the Haven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine; I'm a hustler now
My gear is in, and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man I got my swag'
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly - knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap
That came second to me movin this crack
Give me a second I swear, I would say about my rap career
Till ninety-six came, niggaz I'm here - goodbye!
(Interlude: Gloria Carter)
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping
And umm, into the wee hours of the morning
And then I brought him a boombox
And his sisters and brothers said that he would drive them nuts
But, that was my way to keep him close to me, and out of trouble
(Verse Three: Jay-Z)
Goodbye to the game all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils, you in a spot, knowin' cops could rush
At you in the drop, you so easy to touch
No two days are alike, except the 1st and 15th pretty much
And trust, is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And a drought could define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water
Without work you thirst till you die - YUP!
And niggaz get tied up for product
And little brothers ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this is the stress I lived with
Till I decided to try this rap shit for a livin'
I pray I'm forgiven - for every bad decision I made
Every sister I played - 'cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I've made
This is the life I chose, or rather the life that chose me
(Outro: Fades out)
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black..."

Of the road because the end I'm told is nearer than we know
What can I say but live for today, HOV'!

Yeah, ""The Blueprint 2"" homey, follow the moves
You put on two tube socks, you couldn't walk in my shoes
I was dealt a bad hand, fuck what else could I do
But keep somethin' up my sleeve that'll help me through
But can you believe, everywhere I'm at, models come through
Cat-fightin, cat-walkin', it happens often
It's true how society don't want me to move
Into the penthouse building with spectacular views
They're like uh, ""He's a menace he could never be a tenant""
I'm like ooh, what's a young nigga to do?
I bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that I don't
Give a fuck we just chillin' watchin chandelier ceilings high as fuck
Old lady, don't blow my high
'Specially if you don't know my life, don't make me bring
Sharpton in it 'cause I'm dark-skinneded or
Dude with the 'fro and the Rainbow Coalition, I'ma
Victim of a single parent household, born in a mousehole
Mousetrap, niggaz wanna know
How so, how Jay get up out that, here, yeah
I snatched purses I per-se-vered, yeah
I had work, fiends purchased, it was clear
I was out there sellin hope for despair, but stop there
I swear, I only make good from my mouth to God's ears
Had to get out the hood
And I can't justify genocide
But I was born in the city where the skinny niggaz die
Born in the city where the skinny niggaz ride
And as a skinny nigga I had beef with high size"

Shunning the one thing that they owe they life to
You let that man hype you to go against your idol
Knowing good and god damn well this what I do
Think I'm in the office I'm off my grind

And our brothers on lockdown, home
AMEN!
JEAH! Back blocked on everybody laptop
Hittin' niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da British is comin'
Oh yeah da niggas is comin' get out ya good dishes or somethin' like it's Thanksgiving
And non other than da ""R"" and without further a due like Freddy get ready it's ...
Whatever happen Lord, don't pass me by
Cause whenever I did wrong it was ya name I cried
I heard you forgave over and over again
But when I found out I love you, you became ammune to my sins
Laid wide awake in da middle of my sleep (I see dead people)
And sometimes it's me Lord
I never wanted to be a thug father
I only wanted to be a son of a father
That's how it sounds inside, worse than da war in Iraq, when it's me against I
I gave up da weed and somehow I'm still high
Three years still seein' them three guys Lord (Whoo)
Sometimes I don't know what you want from me, but I do know you know what I want from you
(Give it to me)
(Come on) Take away this Hennessey, take away me runnin' da streets
Stop people from rapin' me, take away all this jealously and prejudicy
Lord you said it was better place, I grew up around pimps, hustlers, hoes and project gates
Its HARD TO BELIEVE in what I can't see
I got to get this money and feed my family
Whatever in me guides my life, dear Lord Don't Let Me Die tonight
But if I shall before I wake, what shall I say
It's been a good run from hoodlum to outin' da states
How could one who made so much foul mistakes, still be allowed to have a smile on my face
How whatever da case I'm glad it wasn't murder, in a town you never heard of
From a nickel plated burner
Now my life straight like a perm, tried to take da spot I earn
Muthafucka better learn
Back blocked on everybody laptop
Hit niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da British is comin'
Oh yeah da niggas is comin' get out ya good dishes or somethin' like its Thanksgiving
And non other than da ""R"" and without further a due like Freddy get ready
Lord hear me out, got a few more things to say
These demons be chasin' me like everyday (Come here)
Nah my life on crutches, never say I never walk again
But da devil is a lie 'cause I believe within'
You're da reason that I'm still here, even though I don't act like it
Even though I hear my callin' and fight it
Fools do me so wrong, its hard to stay righteous
Pimpin' was allowed to happen I'll hide it
Believe me Lord I want you, got money and fame but still it just wont do
Sometimes I don't like who I am, when I look in da mirror my reflection is Uncle Sam (Uncle Sam)
And every night I have these weird dreams, that a preacher trapped inside of me wake up and can't breathe
I feel like its twenty of me, goin' twenty different directions on a one way street Lord
I got houses, money and cars, and met every single superstar
I got da whole music industry sold, but it still don't matter ...
When I'm gone and my casket closed!
Whatever in me guides my life, dear Lord Don't Let Me Die tonight
But if I shall before I wake, I'd accept my fate
I did what I did my heart was in da right place (Oh)
I guess so I can live it put food on my plate
You must still love me not to let it in by three that day
Well whatever da case I'm glad it wasn't murder, in a town you never heard of
From a nickel plated burner
I guess I'm not finished wit my journey, please forgive me for my sins
Shit I'm still tryna learn me
From da back block on everybody laptop

Oh yeah da niggas is comin' get out ya good dishes or somethin' like its Thanksgiving
And non other than da ""R"" and without further a due like Freddy get ready

Walked alone in these streets (Oh) waitin' to hear from you (Come on Lord)

[Jay] This is {bullshit} y'all
[MTV] in New York City for the first day in the trial of
[Jay] I'm gone {*car speeds off*}
[MTV] the State vs. Shawn Carter, a.k.a. Jay-Z
[Jay] Uh, uh-huh-uh, uh, uh-huh-uh, uh
[MTV] Whatever the verdict in this trial may be
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide
(Jay-Z)
Aiyyo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice
Or witness to me killin' the track
Testify till me spillin the smack
Now they got me for traffickin, racketeerin, audio crack
{Hook:} They call me Dope Man, Dope Man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
A broke man, approachin the bench with intent
To bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man
Evidence stemmin from ninety-six
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix
While they was usin' cut I was on some other shit
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised
Listenin to testimony about my foul ways
Exhibit A: ""Reasonable Doubt""
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out
[MTV] You can feel the tension building here
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out
For what may be the ""Trial of the Century""
(Jay-Z)
How come, you label your brand of dope
""Volume 1"" and spread it through the slums?
Fed it to the young with total disregard
Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge
And how could you, turn right around
And release a lethal dosage called ""Volume 2""
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise
Known as Roc-a-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise
Of record execs, and do you object?
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan
And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen
Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons
And we ain't gon' talk about Murder, Inc.
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link
[MTV] The State is seeking the maximum penalty
And with the overwhelming amount of evidence
The D.A.'s presented, things aren't looking good
[MTV] Despite the grim outlook at this point
The rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
In the face of adversity
[MTV] Jay-Z is taking the stand
(Jay-Z)
Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
Keep us spiralin, goin' backwards
At age nine, saw my first hate crime
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine
Climbed over it, at a early age, Jay shined
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine
The soul of Mumia in this modern day time
[MTV] While the jury is inside deliberating
Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation
[MTV] Well the verdict has just been announced: NOT GUILTY!
It is complete pandemonium out here! {Hook; Serena keeps speaking}
People are cheering and hugging - there he is
Jay-Z is exiting the courtroom right now
There is a swarm of cameras surrounding him {*pop bulbs flashing*}

I'm the new Sinatra and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem,  all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot: 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen like the Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow, but B.K. is from Texas
Now I'm up at Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga I be spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from

Big lights will inspire you

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game

You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we selling rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked

Welcome to the bright light
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties who sipping life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd
Now you're in-style, and in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you

Back to take over the globe, now break bread

Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
With no pen just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for THESE GENERATIONS

{*Sighs*} Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high,
Perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereeens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)

So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm lea-vin, that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's one point two
And that's two point four, and I'm only doin' two
You wanted to gain attention new dudes
I can get you BET and TRL too
You wanna be in the public, send your budget
Well fuck it, I ain't budgin!
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me, all star-studded
Golf 4 above par like I putted
All cause the shit I uttered, was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?

I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get you boys sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable and I'm falling
Said that I would've stop be-fore I even started
When I get to one brick, than the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky
Like, sorry God I lied but give me one more try
Got to two bricks new cars new whips
But, niggas never learn till they end up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
Guess there's two sides to what, substance abuse is
Can't stop won't stop innocents new shit
Brand new convertibles I'm so ruthless
Front row fight night see how big my tube is
Fuck HD nigga see how clear my view is {Fallin'}
But there's a price for over doing it
Doing it this big'll put you on the map
Stick up kids is house attacks
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
Damn
I know I shouldn't did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get you boys sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable
Now your {falling} when you should've fell back
Now your {falling} right into they lap
Fallin' they applaud and they screaming at the screen
Damn you fucked up like their favorite movie scene
Godfather, Good Fellas, Scarface, Casino
You've seen what that last run did to Deniro
When he can't beat the odds can't seek the card
Can't blow too hard life's a deck of cards
Now your tumbling is humbling you fall and your mumbling
Under your breathe like you knew this day was coming {falling}
Now lets pray that arm candy that you left you eX for a stay down'll come in handy
Cause come January it gets cold and your letters start to slow and your conversary's low
When your lawyer screens appeal only thinking 'bout a bill
And your chances are a mil damn gravity's ill
I know I shouldn't did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get you boys sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable
But your {falling} and you can't get up
All you do is push up, pull up sit up
Lock down the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistakes that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on 'em and the woman
That you left with is ever got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming hard to keep something on your stomach
Your sick 'bout what you life is be-coming {falling}
But you use to has beens bragging bad 'bout all the new grooves talking stuff on the youtube
'Bout what you use to do, but that's old school
To the new crew they doing numbers like sudoku
Build a new you, and it's damn near inevitable they'll experience deja vu too
Fight and you'll never survive, run and you'll never escape
So just fall for grace
I know I shouldn't did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get you boys sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable and I'm fallin'"

Turn my vocal up, Guru!
Turn the music up too

Super Bowl goals
My wife in the crib feedin' the kids liquid gold
We in a whole different mode
Kid that used to pitch bricks can't be pigeonholed
I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed
Oh, we gon' reach a billi' first
I told my wife the spiritual shit really work
Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all
Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt
All this old talk left me confused
You'd rather be old rich me or new you?
And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new
Like 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh
(Verse 2: JAY-Z & Beyoncé)
Nobody wins when the family feuds
But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute
Pretty much
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us
Fuck rap, crack cocaine
Nah, we did that, Black-owned things
Hundred percent, Black-owned champagne
And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams
Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, huh

Yeah, I'll fuck up a good thing if you let me
Let me alone, Becky
A man that don't take care his family can't be rich
I'll watch Godfather, I miss that whole shit
My consciousness was Michael's common sense
I missed the karma that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'
Kay losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain
Nobody wins when the family feuds
We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools
I'm tryna fix you
I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official
Y'all think small, I think Biggie
Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies
How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me?
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis
We all lose when the family feuds
What's better than one billionaire? Two

Feelin' it feel the Legs pushin up on the sand
I'm feelin' it feel the high that you get from the lye
Feelin' it if you feel it raise your l in the sky
I keep it realer than most I know you feelin' it
Cristal on ice I like those toes I keep from spillin it
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this
On my back the fliest clothes lookin' ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch
And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothin' to live for like them lifers but
Makin' sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price the circle of success- hey turn my mic up
I'm bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light your life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall cause everyone would be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it
Jiggy jigger lookin' gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talkin' 'bout large money, what's the point?
Even if it ain't sunny hey I ain't complainin
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplanin/ what shorty
(Where you disappear to, son?)

Warmin it up for the perfect time to hit your brain and
Ya Feelin' it? to all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt they can vouch my life is real as shit
95 south and poppy on the hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed wit shit
And all the thorough ass niggas that I hustle wit
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers can't really know I'm lovin' it ya feelin' it
What y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay high?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my mom prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams a sniper hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares mom
Those dreams you say you got give me the chills
But these mils make me hot y'all don't feel me
Enough to stop the illin right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feelin' tight
I'm so confused
OK I'm gettin' weeded now I know I'm contradicting myself
Look I don't need that now
It just once in a blue when there's nothin' to do and
The tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zonin me and the chick on the l and then we're bonin
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moanin
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone man
It got me goin' shit"

Billboard, MTV or BET award
Rollin' like we on a tour
Ooh the way you put it down girl I can't take it

And it wasn't afterthought that maybe you'll try to revenge me

And if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song
Plus you promised
And that's really no fun

And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon

Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
Money well invested, rudely interrupted

Sup ma? You want to roll with us, y'knowhatI'msayin?
It's good, it's love, it's all love
We got cases of Belvedere, we gon' play truth or dare
We gon' really get to know one another
All you gotta do is put your hair down, get your mind right
Knahmean? I'm here for you, yo
Relax yourself, let your conscience be free
You now rollin' with them thugs from the R-O-C
Ain't no place on the planet that you'd rather be
But in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game
Cross over to the Roc, make yourself hot
The topic of discussion in every nail shop
It's a secret society, all we ask is trust
And within a week, watch your arm freeze up
Brassiere get right, A to a D cup
Weave get tight, pedicure your feet up
Ears get iced, gear get spiced
From hoodrat to superstar, there's your life
Fuck with Hova, he can take you out of your hell
Say bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel
Say hi to Gucci, Prada as well
Take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself

Now I'm like the teacher, c'mere, let me teach ya
How to play them benches, hold this work in your dentures
How to play it cool when police come to pinch us
Relax mami, let the Belvy flow
Inhale the 'dro, exhale it slow
I could teach you how to roll, teach you bout fly kicks
Teach you how to keep your nose up out of my shit
When the beeper goes off, please don't reach
Like you put a ring or spend cheese on Bleek
Get your mind right baby, goin' through mine crazy
When I'm in the shower, *69 me crazy
Track my last call, contact my broad
With a bitch ?? had physical contact in the mall

But who's to lead 'em? Talk shit to 'em and beat 'em
Get they mind right and feed 'em

Put on a three-piece suit and Shirley Temple my hair

Bought the Jeep, tore the motherfucking doors off.
Foot out that bitch, ride that shit like a skateboard.
Navigation on tryin' to find my next thrill,
Feelin' myself I don't even need an x pill,
Can't chill but my neck will,
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal,
Uh, I don't know why they really worry 'bout my pockets,
Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin' in the projects,
Had her out in Bed Stuy chillin' on the steps,

I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters
Busters they wanted to rush us
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night
When the summertime is in and the tops are down
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)
It took shortsleeves and loungin' to understand
The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you
So I devoted half my time to invest in you
The other half was spent on protecting you
Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me

From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya
It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow
Soon I spent every dolla you became my habit
Other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats
The more checks I got the more I laced my crew
The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue
Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my Boo
Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too
Cop my jewels twice, like deja vu

In the gold chain you thug
Sometimes you given just because
And the tennis bracelet means they want relations
Know that they wanna fuck the only reason they give you up
In the hands of goldiggas you never enough
Rings, things, just never enough
With me and you together gon shine to the end
I mean the thugs love ya but ya girls best friend

But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae-bo

Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in laymen's term, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Knowin' she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring
In and out I'm movin through her student body union and
She, call me professor, say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester

All they do is diss dirt and put a up on my latest
Itinerary, but since I tend to vary see
I tend to carry, more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
Tend to hurries in ten places at once
Plus she can't front just peep how I run mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart
And some day I slow down, but for now I get around
Like the late Makiavelli or Perelli twenty inches

Big ghetto booty, scarf over doobie
Chanell under the louie, Gucci over booty
Vicki covered titties, attitude of the city
Pretty, witty, girly, whirly
One who likes to party but come home early
Light kinda dark, short sorta tall
Slim, kinda thick I swear I love 'em all
She can cook the coke and got hook up on the license
But she can get you first class seats for coach prices
Isn't this great, my flight leaves at eight

I am the one
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playin'
Yeah, I get it down - anxiously the public can't wait
Niggaz had to have it way before it's release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind
That what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggaz upsettin my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, tryin' to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty thou', still ridin' with toast
I ain't tryin' to collide with folk,

I go with you hard; I ain't gon' stop for shit
Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils

And my word niggaz, I heard you niggaz
I'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers
Fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever
B.I.G. is here, the soul of Tupac hovers - above us
(Chorus - R. Kelly)
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me... (I am the one)
What you want from me? Not guilty
(Jay-Z)
Uh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch
Got lame bitches tryin' to fuck with my case
Same lame bitch I bust in her face
Honey just mad I got her fuckin' replaced
Plus a birthday pass without me even touchin my safe
But I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick
But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a betta bitch
You heart the rhetorhic, Jigga hit me over the head
With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothin' gon' change
For nothin' else, you gotta live with yourself
Try and lie on Hov' 'cause I ride on the road
In what, most would describe as a Rolls
NO, that's that Continental T
The only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty
(Chorus - R. Kelly)
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
And you wanna charge me, when I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
(I am the one) I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me... what you want from me?
Not guilty

So you can't touch me nigga, you can't touch me

And I got, all my, mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
I don't, know why, y'all can't see that
Y'all, cats, can't touch me

Uh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz
And it's a Heavy D production you bastards
Come on
Ha hey yo stop playin' man
This is real serious
Ha (It's the rock) yeah yo
(Jay-Z)
Let's go
Post Postatono, Hov' hangin' with Bono
U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And U2 can cool out poolside at the Delano
And U2 flow like you was out of your mind yo
Cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from McDonalds
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know
And who knew dude that played ball for the NBA
Would make a mistake on the who knew estates, throw it away
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today
Now here's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action
They say when you play with skills, good luck could happen
Let's go
(C'mon) It's the Roc (repeat 4X)
That's right
(Jay-Z)
Things got too hot so I jumped off in this rap shit
You got it kris-krossed ain't no turning me backwards
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions
Of one individual he's criminally attached
I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors
While dating all the models and actresses
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio
Trying not to mess up my axis kid
On the road to the riches through trafficking
Through rappining and whatever's happening
Roc-a-wear I'm the young black Ralph Lauren
Every time I get out they put me right back in
The Michael Corleone of the microphone
The Michelangelo of flow I paint pictures with poems
I gather no moss like a rolling stone
Case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon
(C'mon) It's the Roc (3X)
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)
(Lenny Kravitz: repeat 2X)
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses
(Jay-Z)
Tote more Guns then Roses, foes is,
Visibly shook of the invisible bully, let's go
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain
And in order to experience joy you need pain
Every time a baby is born, somebody's slain
You know the saying, somebody's lose is another's gain
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
Everything evens up, you just wait
Even a garbage can gets a steak
You ain't even a garbage can you have faith
But when it turns your way before it turns away
Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay
You will get return in your investment if attention you pay let's go
(C'mon) It's the Roc (3X)
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)
(Lenny Kravitz: repeat 2X)
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes
Some get left behind and some get chosen

At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes
Peep the steez, I represent for all those
With 28 grams, on a come-up tryin' to creep the keys
Large niggaz told me park the car, keep the keys
Find a hoodrat and creep to Mickey D's
First gun two bullets, niggaz know I do pull it
Niggaz tryin' to kill me dog, who wouldn't?
Screw Gooden, I pitch in the PJ's
Lit off the EJ, I split Dutchies with my ring finger
You find a bitch that don't be cream, bring her
Last seen with Bing, he got dropped between us
Shit is constant, that's why I pack the
Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense who wants it?
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall
Man I'm tryin' to come up on y'all
Get one up on y'all, that's why I hustle in these streets
From sundown to sunup on y'all
Mama said keep bullshittin they'll kill you dead
One week of this hustlin brought a living room set
Went to ? D's, niggaz mad, veins out
Copped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out
Flashy, fly little nigga
Nosy bitch from the third floor like ""Why little nigga?""
Bitch please, twist the trees
Took a long pull, like bitch to breathe
That's my answer, life's like cancer
And I'm serious

From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
To droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock, fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama rub on ya tits, and what not

Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50-50, uh huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh huh

I went from lukewarm to hot, sleepin' on futons and cots,
To king size, green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down tight real
I'm tight grill with the phony rappers, you might feel we homeys

Got a lot of beef so logically I prey on my foes
Hustlin' still inside of me and as far as progress
You be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and ya all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it till the second one came out

Drink from a gold chalice

Meaning I had baggage

Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?

So long, so long
In search of victory, she keeps saluting me
If only we can be together momentarily
We can make love, and make history
Why won't you visit me, until she visit me
I'll be stuck with her sister, her name is defeat
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain, so much misery
Like missing your last shot, and falling to your knees
As the crowd screams, for the other team
I practiced so hard for this moment victory don't leave
I know what this means, I'm stuck in this routine
Whole new different day, the same old thing
All I got is dreams, nobody else can see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory, I need you desperately
Not just for the moment, to make history

Hustling like a G while victory wasn't watching took chances repeatedly
As a teenage boy, before acne, before I got proactive I couldn't face she
I just threw on my hoody, and headed to the street
I swear I met success we lived together shortly
Now success was like lust, she's good to the touch
She's good for the moment but she's never enough
Everybodys had her, she's nothing like V
But success is all I got, unfortunately
But I'm burning down the block, hoping in and out of V
But something tells me, there is much more to see
Before I get killed, 'cause I can't get robbed
So before me, success and death ménage
I gotta get lost, I gotta find V
We gotta be together, to make history
(Chorus) (Jay-Z)
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter sup)
And the battle finally won (lighter up)
Victory is finally ours (lighters up)
History so long so long
So long, so long
Now victory is mine, taste so sweet
She's my trophy wife, your coming with me
We'll have a baby, who stutters repeatedly
We'll name him history, he'll repeat after me
He's my legacy, son of my hard work
Future of my past, that'll explain who I'll be
Rank me amongst the greats, either one two or three
If I ain't number one, then I've failed you victory
Ain't in it for the fame, that dies within weeks
Ain't in it for the money, can take it when you leave
I want to be remembered, long after you breathe
Long after I'm gone, long after I breathe
I leave all I am, in the hands of history
That's my last will, testimony
This is much more than a song, It's a baby shower
I've been waiting for this hour, history of ours
Now that all the smoke is gone
And the battle's finally won
Victory is finally ours

Got that rap patrol behind yo, get the runnin'
I'm unstoppable hov', untoppable flows
I'm the compadre, the sinatra of my day
Ol' blue eyes my nigga, I did it my way

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hov' been about that dough since I was a day old
Oh, push perrico if I need to for the rule of evil
Was born in the belly that's the way the streets breed you
One life to live - notice you get no sequel
So I truly got to live this like my last movie
Six oohie, jewels drippin, big toolie
I ball for real, y'all niggaz is Sam Bowie
And with the third pick - I made the earth sick
M.J., hem jay, fade away perfect
I rhyme sicker then every rhyme spitter
Every crime nigga that rhyme or touch a mic because my mind's quicker
I'm eighty-eighter, nine-six to ""reasonable doubt""
Temper short, don't take much to squeeze you out
Yeah you shinin but the only thing you're leaving out
You're a candle in the sun - that shit don't even out
Hold up; now muh'fuckas - y'all muh'fuckas
Better run to the post office and get a job muh'fuckas
Starve muh'fuckas, cause jay been the only one
Eating thus far sub-par muh'fuckas
Even though y'all hate, I love mah mu'fuckas
Friend or foe, y'all all my mu'fuckas
If you havn't heard, I'm michael magic and bird
All rolled in one - cause none got more flows then young
Plus got more flows to come
And if I ain't better then B.I.G., I'm the closest one
So move over - hoes, choose hova
My food for though so hot it give you dudes ulcers
Rovers, roasters, poseurs
Gettin' it in with me, livin' like they suppose tah
Watches, chain, front row at the game
Sold out arena, all screamin my name, c'mon"
99,Holla,2000,The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Uh huh
Is y'all ready?
Is y'all ready??
Holla!
If you real and you know you a G
Holla!
Deep in these streets when you pumpin that D
Holla!
Be in your hood screamin fuck police
Holla!
You keep a gun and you bust for beef
Niggas say I'm focused now, they know that's my style
But dogg, I'm on the block with that coke and a smile
I still got the crack heads I.D.
And they know, I collect for the first and fifteenth
I still take cabs to that capsule spot
For them 31 illusions and them purple tops
And the game ain't change, niggas is taught different
I'm raised off one rule, never get caught slippin
That's why I eat, sleep, shit with my gat
Bag up, take a piss, fuck a bitch with my gat
And I done sold it all from crack to marijuana
You can't deny it, I'm in hoods like Tom Warner
Beat cop, take away, I keep my shit
They don't know I deliver off the beeps I get
And you snitch ass niggas wanna peep my shit
But I'ma show you how deep into these streets I get
See what this game made, and *of age I came*
And you up and coming rappers know you young to this game
*I went from Marcy to Hollywood, I'm back again*
I don't need no applaud, to clap again
Let alone, no award, from rap to win
Talk drama, get yourself wrapped up in
Severe head trauma, get beat with the nine lime-a
Cut your hand off if you fuckin' with my product
That slayed shit, I'm on the grave shift
We all know fucked up money don't pay rent
You short with my ones, you short one thumb
You can't, come up short where the fuck I'm from
We got, dues to pay, new tools to spray
Who's to say, Bleek won't make news today
You know the ooze'll spray if you refuse to pay
And I move the yae nigga day by day"

Welcome to Hollywood baby
-Take my picture
You comin' with?
-Let's not even talk about it
Let's do it
-Let's go
(Beyonce)
I see your jealousy as you're watching (I see you watching)
You're watching (It's all good)
It's kinda sexy to me (I Love it)
How you're watching, you're watching
I see your face (I see your face)
You want to touch it (you want to touch it)
Come to my place (come to the crib)
And let's discuss it (let's chop it up)
Tonight you'll be (tonight you 'gon be a superstar baby)
A superstar
Come let me sign you up (let's get into it)
Ooh it's the lights (you're blinded by the...)
Action! (you need that...)
Hollywood (Uh Uh Uh Uh)
Ooh it's the lights (you're blinded by the...)
Satisfaction (you need that...)
Hollywood (Uh Uh Uh Uh c'mon)
Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high rise
I hide, behind my shades because the fame is blindin my eyes
My god, I know how Ozzy Oz must have felt when he was oz hot
As I have got, I have got to make this stop
People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart
It'll change those 'cause if they had love for you into strangers
When the fame starts, it's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when a train departs
Stranger things have happened
Rappin' stackin platinum plaques
Born in Brooklyn, Got a place in Manhattan
Goin' back to Brooklyn to escape the madness
When your friends is Chris and Gwyneth when your girl is more famous than Juventus
Then it's time to get all your windows tinted
Keep your eyes squinted it's gon flash any minute
The music biz is like musical chairs
It's about where you stand when the music stop spinnin...
(Beyonce)
You got to get it (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Do you want it? (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
But you don't need it (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Till you do, till you do (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Hey Mister, page sixer
A-Lister, you're in the midst of
The ride of your life, but you gotta keep them hits up
Can't put your guard down, gotta keep your mits up
Take a sip sir, it's so intoxicating ain't it?
Try not to get jaded
Hollywood's been good to ya
Startin to feel like buzz to ya
Don't lie, go on fly, you're addicted to the light
Without the fame, how you gon' survive?
It's like bein on heroin, you so high
(Beyonce)
And everybodyies warning you about it (I tried to told you)
And once you taste it you can't live without it (It's addicting)
Not 'cause you choose to not live without it (you sure you want this baby)
It's now a part of you, it's now a part of you (It's a part of you)
And everybodies warning you about it
And once you taste it you can't live
Wanna be seen now, groupies
Now you've become what you once despised
James Dean, John Belushi, blow your whole life trying to live in the lights
Heroin's following, Marijuane hopping over the edge
It's like Janis Joplin
River Pheonix, Jimi Hendrix
Jimmy Morrison all of them ended by Hollywood
Thank God for Hollywood
Hollywood...
You sure you want this baby?
Hollywood, it's the most addicting drug in the world
You want the fame
You want the lights"

You'd steal the food right out of my mouth and I watch you eat it
I still don't know why, why I love you so much
Ohhh
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Air all my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
Yeah
And baby. it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup till it runneth over

Blue told me to remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y’all talk about, I'm the nigga
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
God damnit it I like it
The bright lights enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil for one fight
But soon as all the money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Mama please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame

Enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high, sitting low
Sliding by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain works
I think back, you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with it, this shit ain't work
This light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and IRS
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad, take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with the bath water
You're still alive
Still that nigga
Nigga you survived
You still getting bigger nigga
Living the life
Vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson, Thriller
And baby. it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair

You get the air of my lungs whenever you need it
You take the blade right out of my heart just so you can watch me bleeding
I still don’t know why, why I love you so much
Yeah
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink with guess who’s name
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
Yeah

Uh, it's the boy Jay-Z, and the boy R. Kel
The best of both worlds, please believe it
Brookland, Chi-Town, to all the beautiful ladies in the world
Dedicated to TT my niece, everybody in the world, talk to 'em Kel
That's right, Tone this is mean and vicious man, so mean and vicious
Rockland, Roc-a-Fella, the best of both worlds, come on
(Verse 1: Jay-Z)
Lord forgive me I'm ballin' out of control
Got the spirit of a hustler pouring out of my soul
Mami I love you but ain't no stopping my stroll
If you wanna be down with me you gotta rooolll
Like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold
You gotta know that I'm out chasin' doooough
I'm ain't stunting these hoes
Stunting my growth if I fuck 'em I'm fleeing them
I need something to hold
Then I'm home to you
I might roam like a cellular phone
But I never leave you alone I
Solemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you
It's still a part of me there but I
Solemnly swear, I try but it's in my blood
Pumping yay since I was yay high
I'm in love with the life
So except me for the bastard that I am
You're still in love with me right?
(Chorus: R. Kelly)
Baby I can't figure it out
Said you pussy tastes like honey
But I can't stop huggin' the block
All night tryna get this money
Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gonna do with both these girls
Two main squeezes in separate cities
Both found out man, shit ain't pretty
Stuck between these two worlds
What I'm gonna do with both these girls
Hard to choose between her and these streets
'Cause the game keeps calling me
(Verse 2: Jay-Z)
Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock
I would often find I was off my block
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot
They never thought that a pause or stop
Was in my pores to push rock raw
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low
Like a one against the grain
Got the sun against my brain
A girl in my ear
I like her for her
I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her
Sometimes I can't figure it out
I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out
She know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house
Lock down while his niggas is out (out)"
103,Hova Song (Intro),1999,Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"(Jay-Z)
Yeah, I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD
If you like me you readin the credits right now
If you in your car, I don't care if it's winter
I want you to put all your windows down
Zone out, buckle up, let's go
Hello it's Hova; that's right young'un the wait is over
The new millineum is upon us, the album is here
Before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear
Rappers with no relation:
There's ""Seven Degrees of Seperation"" and I'm Kevin Bacon
This is the murderer's version
Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person
Hova the God, I should be rappin' with turban
Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him
Mike Jordan of rap - outside J workin
Now watch how quickly I drop 50
I don't like playin', niggaz can't stick me
Niggaz can not jam me, niggaz can't get me
Slimmy at the Rucka wanna leave and spend with me
I consistently take 'em out the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe? It's Hova the God
(Pain In Da Ass)
Makes you think about the people in your life
Then I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here
He'd say, ""Jay, what's it about? What's life about?
If you don't go through as a man's a man""
He'd say, ""Suck it up, take the fall, do the time
That's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are""
How many years you been around this thing of ours?
Commision, 125 years
What's it about?
It's about rules, parameters
You take the beatin' for the friend you don't lay down
You don't betray who you are, what you are
You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory
They don't roar, they don't rap
You know why? That's the rules, you don't break them
You was born to be somethin' I wasn't even supposed to be... humble
Okay so you humble me now, what you got?
You got a war, you got global war
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now
There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings
There's no feelings for this game
So... five ten years from now
You're gonna wish there was American Commision
Five ten years from now...
They're gonna miss Jay-Z
Oahhhkay, I'm reloaded!"
104,Hova Song (Outro),1999,Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter (1999),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"(Jay-Z)
Who ever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?
Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
Duckin the plain cops, pushin indo and 'caine
At the kitchen table late night, no pen, just my brain
First album niggaz love me 'cause they thought I was poor
Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more
Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin raw
Skully tilted, pants saggin, damn near touchin the floor
And I come with do-rags to your so-called awards
T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all
Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad
He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path
A&R's had me feelin' like moss in the drab
So I turned the league out with ""Reasonable Doubt""
Get your CD's out, let's go, song for song
I'm the illest nigga doin' it till y'all prove me wrong
Do you believe?
It's Hova the God, uh, uh, uh..."
105,Hovi Baby,2002,The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Yes, yes YEP!
Welcome to the... Jay-Z extravaganza
I'd like to introduce my band right now
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe
Right now I want you to give the drummer some
No ma really, give the drummer some
Uh
Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable
Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)
(Jay-Z)
Follow the flow, look
They say a midget standin on the giant's shoulder can see much
Further than the giant... (the giant..)
So I got the WHOLE rap world on my shoulder they tryin' to see
Further than I am... (than I am..)
And I have been tryin' to be patient with they preoccupation
With David and Goliath... (Goliath..)
But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course
And I'm forced to be a tyrant... (be a tyrant..)
But bein tyrant, comin' through your environment
Iron mask, nigga iron gas, nigga I am back
With ""The Team,"" no I in that
R.O.C., y'all not eyein that
Y'all don't see, clearly cause the reign ain't gone
""The Dynasty,"" no not Ming but Shawn's
Dame careems, nigga it's the gangsta team
Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
The other reason, we got a gang of green
If there's better at gettin' cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga
WOO! Jeah, jeah
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable...
(Jay-Z)
Jeah, look
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm bout to start another life
Look behind you, I'm bout to pass you twice
Back to the future and gotta slow up for the present
I'm fast, niggaz can't get past my past
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?
When I unwrap ""The Gift and the Curse"" in one session
Ain't no livin' person can test him
Only two restin in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight summers, critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before, you get I had it
Got mad at it and don't want it no more
And that goes for everything from flippin that raw
Flippin whores, flippin vocal chords, don't get it twisted
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)
(Jay-Z)
Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone
The world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back
You cats overfelt yourself
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the reel for reel
In my absence cats get, absent-minded
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
Why I'm in the position that I am
Changin the game, my game could nail Madonna
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor
History in the makin', Pistol Pete
Leave competition shakin without missin' the beat
Chasin the hi-hat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face so blue like it's holdin' it's breath
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check
It's the bow tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck
Live and correct I will bring it to your set
I got now, I don't care who got next
Rapper slash exec, Kordell Stewart
Your flow all y'all usin' is mine, you're all useless
You ain't a factor, who are you foolin?
You all are faggots, you takin' it backwards (takin' it backwards)
I'm tryin' to progress with this rap shit
Nigga, nigga your whole career is a accident
Who was gassin 'em? (Fuck outta here!)"

(Singing: Paul Anka + (Jay-Z))
Now, the end is near (Can you believe this shit Guru?)
So I face (I'm from the hood man) the final curtain
(No the REAL hood the hood, not the RAP hood)
(The REAL hood, like three pair of pants)
My friends, I'll say it clear (pair of sneakers)
(My moms is bustin' her ass) State my case
(Nigga I'm goin' to Japan tomorrow!) Which I'm certain
(You understand what I'm sayin'? Can you believe that?)
I lived a life that's full (They have people, waitin)
(At the airport like five days like I'm a Beatle or somethin')
(That's really somethin'!) And I travelled each, and every highway
(Seen the best of the best, the worst of the worst) and more
Much more than this (still here) I did it my way
Let's try this one
(Jay-Z + (singer))
Uh, yeah... gangsta nigga!
Put my hustle down, tore the game up nigga
Took your high score down, put my name up nigga
Tore the doors down till the Hall of Fame is Jigga
I did it my way (and more... much more than this)
That's right, it's a beautiful thing man!
(I did it my way) I did it my way -- Hovi baby!
Momma's youngest and strongest, survived summers like saunas
Mastered a corner like Deion in his uniform
Pop hurtin' assertive, flirted with death
Damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
Grandma's favorite, she could not understand
How there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor
Has to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse
As a reminder that I make top paper?
Black entrepreneur, nobody did us no favors
Nobody gave us shit, we made us
The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Dame's Sam Davis
Big's the smart one on the low like Dean Martin
We came in this game, not beggin niggaz pardon
Demandin y'all respect, hand over a check
And while y'all at it, hand over the jet
We the reason they ain't hand over Def Jam so quick
They new every year I was droppin' new product
I was raisin the stock up, while buildin the Roc up
But that's all right, 'cause they knew they had to see us
When it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-ires
Je-je-jeah!
(And more, much more than this; I did it my way)
Jeah! ""In My Lifetime""
I caught smaller cases, but I had capital
Hypocritic system let me right back at you
You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude
They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
And they can look good by paintin him as bad news
Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views
Exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
So imagine how disturbed I was
When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
Let me explain exactly how this shit was
This nigga Un yo I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin
But it's cool 'cause he's back friends, and half-inning is over
It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to bein Hova
Me back with the chaffeur, laid back
Helicopter seat, feat inclined, shit feelin' like a sofa
Helicopter meet me, Teta Vero (?) take me over
Somewhere peaceful for the weekend now it's back to speakin' of vultures
So the next time that page six approaches us
Here's a quote from Jay, nigga I did it my - way
(And more, much more than this; I did it my way)"

Drunk off Crist', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all...""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth marked jeans, take that off

You wanna see how far I'ma go
How, much I'ma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Crist', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies

Verse 1 : Jay Z
She wants that old thing back
She want those heroin tracks
She likes me, she fiends me for the nightly
She leans for me, morning she rush for my touch
This is about LUST
Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her
My presence is a must, must, must
Bonita applebum. I gotta put you on,
If I didn't when we cuttin' the feeling'll be too strong
In any form, I'm giving you sweet dreams
That sugar heals, she call me her sweet thing
That black rain will take away your pain
Just for one night, baby take me in vein
Now that feelin' got you tripping
You don't want to feel no different
They say lust has got you itching
Nose wide open and it's dripping
I know what you like, I am your prescription
I'm your physician, I'm your addiction.

I am so dope, like Lou Vuitton with the red bottoms
You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em
Like every color just separate your guilty pleasure is me
It's so much fun, you shun therapy
Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting
Shopping's like copping, you constantly need it
I'm never around, you constantly seeking
You'll never be down, I know where your peak is
Nine and a half half weeks is better than 12 steps
I keep trying to remind you to keep tellin' yourself
Now your conscience is interfering like better yourself
Like you better get help, but when that medicine's felt
We're back together, don't ever leave me
Don't ever let them tell you that you'll never need me
My china white, till we be away
It's Montgeo forever, baby let's get away
Hook/Chorus:
(And I know, and I know, and I know...)
Everything you like
Everything you love
Baby you like life
Baby you love love
Baby you love HOV!
How could leave me? I thought that you needed me
When the world got too much and you pleaded with me
Who helped you immediately, how speedy of me
How could you deny me so vehemently?
Now your body is shaking, trying to free it of me
And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me

It ain't everyday that you make it out
To be on top of yachts waving
I remember you saving for the light bill
Paid the rent with a light bill
Now my crib dark as a basement
And you'd lock up the when you wasn't home
We was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic
Our cable was basic
No HBO, no WHT
Just Ralph McDaniels on the station
I aggravated you for Atari and Coleco Vision
Pinstripe Lee's when the first day day of school came
I was OK with not having everything as long as Saturdays
You had the Commodores playing
The expression on your face was priceless
It's still with me till this day
Baby girl I won't erase it
I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made
You deserve a standing ovation

Write down your wish list

Leave an extra tip Ma
Be extra nice to 'em

If I should die don't cry my niggas
Just ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Get on my niggas when it's real
Say word to Shawn my niggas
If I should die *echoes*
Don't cry my niggas it's been one hell of a ride my niggas
In the middle of the trial I flip pies my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige my niggas
I've eluded the coppers got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Caesar Picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
Rocked jewels dropped school still didn't fail
Rhymes still written well hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
Sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me
Everybody around us become one for that day
To live life get your shit right and play
Don't get it twisted like braids if I miss that's ok
But life's short don't miss a day uh
If I should die don't cry my niggas

When I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Just keep gettin' it on my niggas
Say word is bond my niggas
I got a lot to look back on in '88
Got my crack on ten years later gettin' my rap on
Gettin' shorties like a thespian
Had an episode with two lesbians got a fetish for that
Drunk ginseng with Japanese chicks and pulled the root out
Squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts
Been on both coasts fired all kinds of heat
Probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets
I got demands to meet and questions to fulfill
Like is that mystery God real?
And how was Kennedy killed? I ain't mad
I must've smoked a ton of reefer sipped Coronas
With Latifah broke the code of Geneva
I know when I reach the other side I'ma see the
Cat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker
Then it's on again if I could be born again
I live my life through my son
And tell him never have a friend
Just family reincarnated I'll show him the time
That I waited to get paid tell him never be afraid
Niggas hearts pump Kool Aid and yo blood run thicker
Never shed tears cry liquor my nigga
If I die don't cry my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride my niggas

When I'm gone don't mourn my niggas
Just keep bangin' these songs my niggas
Say word is bond my niggas

Don't wonder why my niggas
When I'm gone live on my niggas
Just follow my path my niggas
Say word to Half my nigga
I'm the aftermath of pleasure never die alone
Born to live forever through life's struggles
I cut corners and took drastic measures
See you niggas life expire right in front of me
Time could never mend what these cold streets
Mentally done to me too often I close my eyes
And see my own coffin feelin' haunted ready to leave
This world that I'm lost in my only chance
To see the seeds I lost through abortion
When I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn
Keep flossin' as long as my name
Lives on what's most important
I'll be down in hell scorchin' preparin' for life
Afterlife still torchin' and blazin' these mics
It'd rain for 40 days and 40 nights
And I'd return on the 3rd like Christ
Without my physical portion
My spirit a poltergeist for sure
I'll be back through the heist tomorrow
Blood over y'all fake niggas door
What you thought? [huh]
What you thought? [nigga]

...I'd tell Big they're still hearin' his songs
Run into Pac ask him where we went wrong
Tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form
Is everything that's invisible gone?
I need to know will I still feel pain or will it be ironic?
Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?
Can I reveal the game to all the hustlers
Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?
Can I puff cigars and drink Cristal?
If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?
Can I still touch lives answer they ""what's & whys""
Make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?
If I should die...

I spit that other shit
That's the nice motherfucker shit
Fed time follow me around, deep cover shit nigga
You beer money, I'm all year money
I'm popping, you ain't got to count it, it's all there money
I never change money 'cause niggas got strange money
Narced up, marked up, fucked up in the game money
I got bail money, XXL money
You got flash now, but time will reveal money
I spit the hottest shit, you need it I got it shit
That down South Master P, Bout It Bout It shit
I got blood money, straight up thug money
That brown paper bag under your mattress drug money
You got show dough, little to no dough
Sell a bunch of records and you still owe dough
I got 900 and 96 plus 4 more dough
You crazy, you full gazy, I'm loco with dough papo
Imaginary Players
Verse Two:
And now you got these young cats acting like they slung caps
All in they dumb raps, talking about how they funds stack

Where's all the ice with all the platinum under that?
Those ain't rolex diamonds, what the fuck you done to that?
Y'all rapping-ass niggas, y'all funny to me
You selling records being you but still you want to be me
I guess for every buck you make it's like a hundred for me
And still you running around thinking you got something on me
But I done did it
And y'all want to take my flow, and run with it
That's cool, I was the first one with it
Orig-i-nal, jigga's the future, flow dig-i-tal

Your single was 99 cents, mines was 4 bucks
Last year, when niggas thought it was all luck
But this year I've done it again, Jiggaa! ...what the fuck
Nigga, stop whining, jigga, still shining
Niggas kept complaining so I copped more diamonds
Rocked more Versace, ain't nothing sweet
I still throw t'ree in your body, fleeing the party
Y'all can't go with me, nope, flow with me
Bet 50, not dollars either, I brought some dough with me
I flow like the 5 series, in various areas
And blow holes in your weak niggas theories
It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game
You bought a 4.0 you better get your change

Ain't no manicures on board, then switch your plane"

I'm bravin' temperatures below zero, no hero
No father figure, you gotta pardon a nigga
But I'm starvin' my niggaz, and the weight loss in my figure
Is startin' to darken my heart, 'bout to get to my liver
Watch it my niggaz, I'm tryin' to be calm but I'm gon' get richer
Through any means, with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture
Never read the Qu'ran or Islamic scriptures
Only psalms I read was on the arms of my niggaz
Tattooed so I carry on like I'm non-religious
Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures
Niggaz, say it's the dawn but I'm superstitious
Shit is as dark as it's been, nothin' is goin' as you predicted
I move with biscuits, stop the harder niggaz, actin' too suspicious
This is food for thought, you do the dishes"
118,Intro: A Million and One Questions/Rhyme No More,1997,"In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997)",East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Somebody's pulling me closer to the ground
I ain't panicked, I been here before
Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who, and what was what
Man look at these suckers
I ain't no rapper, I'm a hustler
It just so happens that I know how to rap
Okay, I'm reloaded!
I did it again niggaz
Fucked up, right? I know
I know what y'all niggaz asking yourself
Is he gonna ever fall off?
No...
...A lot of speculation
On the monies I've made, honeys I've slayed
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
Is it true he slay the beef and slept with a tech?
What's the position you hold? Can you really match
A triple platinum artist buck by buck by only a single goin' gold?
Roc-A-Fella ship fold, and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O
For the millionth time askin me
Questions like Wendy Williams, harrassin me
Then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinnin on my sleeve
Uh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?
What you doin' in L.A., with phillipinos and ese's
Latinos and Cheve's, down by Pico with Frederico
I answer all your questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is how bad you want to know? BLAOW!
Roc-A-Fella y'all, uh, uh
Know my style
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
Till I'm no more, 'cause I'm so raw
My flow expose holes that they find in yours
Wasn't for me, niggaz still be dying for whores
But I hate when a nigga sit back, admirin yours
Young blood you better get that, we frying baccars
Niggaz don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse
And don't listen to the rappers, they dying to floss
I used to be O.T., applyin the force
Shoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss
Come back with the click playing Diana Ross
I'm the boss and this is how it's gonna be
Burnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V
I got mouths to feed till they put flowers on me
And kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like I was Cochise
Tombstone read 'He Was Holdin' No Leaks'
Started from the crack game and then so sweet
Freaked it to the rap game, Jigga the old-G
On MTV, telling 'em how I sold D
And used to back work up out of apartment 4-B
Me and my homie, started out coldies
Picked the mailbox lock 'cause I ain't have no key
Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'
Then I went low key, but now I'm back it's on
Motherfuckers
Jigga, uh-huh, yeah
Roc-A-Fella y'all
Uh, feel this"
119,It Ain't Personal,2002,The Best of Both Worlds (2002),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Man, they go and tell me like
You never know who your true friends until you ah umm
Both got a little bit of money
I mean cause y'all both broke
Then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke
And if you got money and he ain't got no paper
He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you
When y'all both get some paper, you'll see
We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes (mm)
We even sold to the same damn fiends (how real is dat?)
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal
Look, I'm a grown man dog
And I ain't got time to be runnin' behind y'all
I know when I first started it was crazy to y'all
""He's gon' start his own label, he'll never be able""
Well, nigga you've been wrong before
And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him
We move through the hood like identical twins
But it just so happen that a nigga made it rappin'
You showed your true colors, y'all niggaz stay yappin
That don't stop him, a nigga weigh platinum
Stop through the hood, to say what's happenin'? (sup nigga)
Fake hugz (uh-huh) fake whassup
Fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs
Gotta one myself for your fake shit, I raise up
Hop in my wheels and I peel, streets are blazed up (uh-huh)
About my bid'ness dog, y'all need to stay up - one
We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes
We even sold to the same damn fiends
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal
I wish, I wish - that success, we could all
Get a piece of it (word) but that ain't real dog (no)
Cause in these streets it's war, the industry much more
But rich or poor, I'ma keep it real my nigga
Invest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger
And do things like, pull up to some clubs
In the skirts with Jigga, and yellin' out HEY!
What the fuck, pop that Cris' my nigga
And then he wants to know how many chips I done sold
Well it ain't y'all business what's behind my doors
But y'all niggaz don't appreciate shit
Helped you out and you still actin' like a little bitch
Then you wonder why I put yo' ass in the tenth row
When you asked me for some tickets to my TP-2 show
Lawwwwwwd tell me, why we don't like to see us grow
We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes
We even sold to the same damn fiends
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal
A-Alike (uh-huh) be alike (that's right)
We don't vibe no more because we don't C/see alike
And your mom got it twisted, she think Hov' changed
Nope; Hov's still here like Rogaine
Ask your boy what he did to the Hov' game
How he jeapordized the whole game
Now when we see each other it's so strange
I don't know whether to hug him or slug him (damn)
I don't know whether to cap him or dap him
I don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happenin'
But what I do know, all the niggaz that you know
Locked up doin' a few doe, but who knows?
Maybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm buggin too (right)
But I'm scared dog, I don't know what the fuck to do
Do me a favor, place yourself in my shoes
The game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules
We used to get money together, phone honies together
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same schemes
We even sold to the same damn fiends
Ain't no rules in this war for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal"

Verse One: Jay-Z
As a young and dumb man, gun in the waist
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
And had to numb it with baste
Couldn't drink the henny straight, I needed somethin' to chase
I needed something to chase
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste
Life is like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winin, till the earth stop spinnin
Rock hot lenin, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not remembering,
My motto is simply I will not lose, abide by the block rules,
I buy my glock used, wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood,
If you ain't live like I live then run with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper till this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature, if hell awaits ya?
Nigga I'm coming with the razors, still flashin ya shit
Try to pass me in a six, tight classy on the wrist
Every bit of 30 karats, this is not a game
This isn't why I came, make these words find a spot on your brain
And burn, then I recycle my life
I shall return

Inpregnate the world when I ""cum"" through your speakers (ha ha)
Fuck hot my records got the fever
Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up
I creep up when the beef heats up, caught him with his feet up
And shoes off, bout to snooze off
Hatin', cause you can't turn the booze off
You dudes is too soft, when I fuck with you all
I might bark your ex, and spit at the locks
But, other than that I ain't even fucking with cats
Just me tied B.I., thug it like that, me, dame and biggs

Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em

Smokers out back, sellin they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law

I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight

As she cares about me!""
Let's do this for these babies
Mercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres
Blatantly ballin' on HD
Y'all need to step up y'all AV
Life changed again I was already taking off
My flight changed again
Slight change of winds
It's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
Baby needs Pampers
Daddy needs at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block
I thought my daddy didn't love me
My baby getting chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww isn't she lovely
Now I'm staring at praying that things don't get ugly
And I'm stuck in that old cycle, like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody
I need a joint right now
Just the thought alone fucks with me
High on life
I could die from the fall
Imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order
To Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me
You would be with me
Sort of like daddy dearest
I dream filthy (my mom and pops) mixed me with Jamaican
(Rum and whiskey) what a set off (What a set off)
And I know I'm not perfect baby
I been through so much trauma
It gonna be hard to reverse it
With some doctors and some nurses maybe
Teach me on how to treat a lady
Open doors on the 'Cedes
This relationship shit is complicated
All I know is we ain't speaking everyday
I fucking hate it
I don't wanna duplicate it
I seen my mom and pop drive each other motherfuckin' crazy
And I got that nigga blood in me
I got his ego and his temper
All is missing is the drugs in me
High on life
I could die from the fall
Imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order
To Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me
You would be with me
Sort of like daddy dearest
Father never taught me how to be a father
Treated mother I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
Baby with no daddy want no mama drama I just wanna
Take her back to a time when everything was calmer
Out in Paris on a terrace
Watching the Eiffel Tower
And a Ferris wheel yet and still
Nothing could prepare us
For the beauty that you be Blue be
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror
Have to face my fears
Cheer up
Why could you just be happy
Without these back and forth thoughts
You too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter
Taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared
But in life and death if I ain't here
High on life
I could die from the fall
Imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order
To Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me
You would be with me
Sort of like daddy dearest"

'Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash
Till the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass
The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash
See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass
All I gotta do is let 'em call me Shawn they glad
Let me sit up in they whip till I launch it back
Snap they neck, then shoot 'em till they arch them back
The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat
Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back
Monster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that
And e'rybody sing-a-long to the track, c'mon
Uh-huh uh uh

Lampin in the Hamptons, the weekends man
The Stan Smith Adidas and the Campers
Or playin' guts on the cruise, Hermes bow shoes
The Izod bucket on I'm so old school
Yellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops
Six top model chicks, who is this hot?
J-A, ladies help me say it now

She never seen a hundred on the wrist before
Never seen twenty-two's on the 6 before

Cause the boy got more 6's than first grade
The crib got, killer views and square feet
You have to film MTV Cribs for a week
So, sleep if you need to, mami I will leave you
Right where you stand, nah I don't wanna dance (I'm good)
I just wanna see what's in your Frankie V pants
Waist is low enough to let your waist show
Top like a rock star, I got a fast car
We can cruise the city, doin' above sixty

""He did it again!"" Haters no like
But they gotta fuck with it cause the flow's so tight
Gnarly dude! I puff Bob Marley dude
All day, like Rastafari's do
Now I'm stuck to the point I could hardly move
You fuckin' up my high, don't bother me dude
But Red Rover, send your hoes over
She can do WHATEVER, sip somethin' with soda
She can leave WHENEVER, sip somethin' with Hova
We can play HOWEVER, slay bed or sofa

Chea
Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit em with numerous
Shots with the four four
Faggots wanna talk to Po-Po's, smoke em like cocoa
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshittin, glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin shocked when the bullet hit
Oh hey ma, how you, know niggaz wanna buy you
But see me I wanna Fuck for Free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it
Inside your belly, if it's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me
I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact that everyone can see
These scars
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe
This is real
So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got
Got a condo with nuttin but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroll
See how I was flowin on my last cassette?
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin a Tec, never jam though
Never get high, never run out of ammo
Niggaz hatin n shit cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're, actin raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your hoe, wanna marry your hoe
Now she's mad at me, causer Your Majesty, just happened to be
A pimp with a tragedy
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked her friend
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, ""Shit
There's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!""
I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make
Sense
I am what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear
Me out
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
No
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not

129,Justify My Thug,2003,The Black Album (2003),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"(Intro: Jay-Z Talking)
Uh, this feel right right here Quik
It's like it's 'sposed to happen this one right here
Young! God damn...
... Let me justify my thug on this one right here
(Verse One)
It goes one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock rock
Five six seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock
Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, the party bout to pop
Then - (Roc-A-Fella y'all), it's your boy S. Dot
And I ain't never been to jail;
I ain't never pay a nigga to do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell even if it means sittin' in a cell
I ain't never ran, never will
I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands to himself
Or get clapped for what's under that man's belt
I never asked for nothin' I don't demand of myself
Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself
I just play the hand I'm dealt,
I can't say I've never knelt before God
And asked for better cards at times to no avail
But I never sat back feelin' sorry for myself
If you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell
Till it's heaven
(Chorus: imitating Madonna)
Justify my thug! {*""For you!"" - Run-D.M.C.*}
My thug... (hoping..)
My thug... (praying..) for you
To justify my thug!
My thug... (hoping..)
My thug... (praying..) for you...
{*""For you! Fresh"" - Run-D.M.C.*}
(Verse Two)
Now if you shoot my dog, I'ma kill yo' cat
Just the unwritten laws in rap - know dat
For every action there's a reaction, don't have me relapsin
Relaxin's what I'm about, but about mine
Don't be actin' like you can't see street action
Take me back to +Reasonable Doubt+ time
You see my mind's on the finish line, facin the wreck
I put my muh'fuckin' faith in the tec, tell Satan not yet
You understand I am chasin my breath
I am narrowly escapin my death, oh yes
I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster
Travellin Mach 5, barrelin, my power can stop God
God forgive me but I can't let them deliver me to you
Until, I won this race, then eventually
My engine gon' burn out, I get whatever is meant for me
However it turns out fine - red line!
(Verse Three)
They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wrong and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? (Good question right!)
'Fore you knock the boy, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggaz standin tight, there's limits on the ave
Tryin' to cop or shot-call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up
Every other corner there's a liquor store - fuck is up?"

And you know better, nigga, I know you do
But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue
You had no father, you had the armor
But you got a daughter, gotta get softer
Die Jay Z, this ain't back in the days
You don't need an alibi, Jay Z
Cry Jay Z, we know the pain is real
But you can't heal what you never reveal
What's up, Jay Z? You know you owe the truth
To all the youth that fell in love with Jay Z
You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a Saint, this ain't KumbaYe
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him 20 million without blinkin'
He gave you 20 minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
""Fuck wrong with everybody?"" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', ""Finish your breakfast!""
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say
Nigga, never go Eric Benét!
I don't even know what you woulda done
In the Future, other niggas playin' football with your son
You woulda lost it

She might put poor kids through school
My stake in Roc Nation should go to you
Leave a piece for your siblings to give to their children too
TIDAL, the champagne, D'USSÉ, I'd like to see
A nice peace-fund ideas from people who look like we
We gon' start a society within a society

There was a time America wouldn't let us ball
Those times are now back, just now called Afro-tech
Generational wealth, that's the key

That's how we keep Carter money all in the family
You see, my father, son of a preacher man
Whose daughter couldn't escape the reach of the preacher's hand
That charge of energy set all the Carters back
It took all these years to get to zero in fact
I hated religion 'cause here was this Christian
He was preachin' on Sundays, versus how he was livin' Monday
Someday I forgive him
'Cause strangely our division led to multiple religions
I studied Muslim, Buddhist, and Christians
And I was runnin' from him, He was givin' me wisdom
See how the universe works?
It takes my hurt and help me find more of myself
It's a gift and a curse
That's called the red queens race
You run this hard just to stay in place
Keep up the pace, baby
Keep up the pace

Made Hov say, ""Ok so, make another Hov""
Niggaz wasn't playing they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends, business interests as they go
Ain't nothing left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossing
Too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov have to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is
The worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see, what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too but, not like them
You lost one

Lose one, let go to get one
Left one, lose some to win some (You lost one)

You lost one
I don't think it's meant to be, be
But she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So we, ain't we
It's me, and her
'Cause what she prefers over me, is work
And that's, where we, differ
So I have to give her
Free, time, even if it hurts
So breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this earth to be
All you can be, like the reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she, her, time to serve
The time's now for her
In time she'll mature
And maybe we, can be, we, again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now, it ain't fair
So yeah, she lost one

Left one, lose some to win some (Oh yeah, she lost one)

So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault

Place any burden on me, but please, not that lord

Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit

Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like having your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life, to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waiting for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it
Lose one, let go to get one
Left one, lose some to win some (Colleek, I lost one)
Story of a champion, Colleek, you're a champion
I lost one"

Lucifer, dawn of the morning! I'm gonna, chase you out of Earth
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of de morning...
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of the morning! I'm gonna, chase you out of Earth
(Kanyeeze you did it again, you a genius nigga!)
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of the morning...
So you niggas change your attitude
For they askin what happened to you
(Verse One)
Lord forgive him
He got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinnin'
Them a murder me so I gotta murder them first
Emergency doctors performin procedures
Jesus
I ain't tryin' to be facetious
But ""Vengance is mine"" said the Lord
You said it better than all
Leave niggas on deaths door
Breathin off res-por-rators
For killin' my best boy, HATERS
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Mabach Benz
Flier than Sanaa Lathan
Pumpin ""Brown Sugar"" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles
Like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature
Ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been readin your Psalms and chapters
Payin' your tithes being good Catholics
I'm commin
Lucifer, dawn of the morning! I'm gonna, chase you out of Earth
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of the morning...
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)

So you niggas change your attitude
For they askin what happened to you
(Verse Two)
Yes
This is Holy war
I wet cha all with the Holy water
Spray from the Heckler, Koch auto
Matic all the static shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical I throw a couple at you
Take six
Spread love to all of my dead thugs
I'll pour out a little Louis till I head above
Yes Sir
And when I perish
The meek shall inherit the earth
Until that time it's on a poppin' - Church
Like Don Bishop
The fifth upon cock either
Lift up your soul or give the Holy ghost please
I leave ya in somebody's Cathedral
And stuntin like Evil Kenevil
I'll let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk the more you irkin us
The more you gonna need memorial services
The Black Albums second verse is like
Devil's Pie save some dessert for us
(Breakdown)
Man I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these Devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They won't be happy till somebody dies
Man I gotta get my soul right
'For I'm locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems it's all right
Somebody want they soul to rise
(I'll chase you off of this Earth)
(Verse Three)
I got dreams of holdin' a Nine milla
To Bobs killa
Askin him ""why?"" as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten holmes I still feel ya
SO... curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your Church mass
Reverse the crash
Reverse the blast
And reverse the car
Reverse the day, and there you are
Bob Allah
Lord forgive him. we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the sun of the morning
Thanks Again"

There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong. Nah Mean?
How can a mother fucka go round a hate a nigga
He never even met that he don't even know and shit?
I think this rap shit is all beef
Y'all don't even know everyday I'm livin' with stress
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
I'm on the dance floor hot ass vest
You think I'm freakin' these chicks right?
I'try not to brush against they chest
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped
Swear to everything when I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines
Gimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me
And I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars... Lucky Me
(Chorus: Karen Anderson)
You only know what you see,
You don't understand what it takes to be me.
I hate all girls with alterior motives
That's why I'm twenty plus years old, no sons no daughters
Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
Hear the hate in my voice right? I hate that you noticed
Niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own
Hate a nigga like that faggot, get your own
Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome
Knowing one day I'm'a have to flip, c'mon
You know the shit don't stop till the Crist don't pop
And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock
I'm trapped the whole worlds against me in fact,
It ain't no turning back. Bring It On
Hate the price of fame cause it cost too much
Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?
Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
Steady looking for flaws through us... Lucky Me
(Chorus: Karen Anderson, Jay-Z)
You only know what you see,
You don't understand what it takes to be me
You only know what you see,
(Since I was 4 years old, I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold)
You don't understand what it takes to be me
(And now that I've arrived
I see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold)
Nigga see you in the street, pretend to be friendly
But I know any type of success breeds envy
I know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me
Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny
But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive
Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up
And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up
Don't grieve for me my art remains
Like a dart from the speaker to your heart
Spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal
Plan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life
Though I can't see past the girls greed to call her wife
Next time your thinking heist better be precise
'Cause I'm fully prepared. One of us is gon' leave here
I have no regrets even though I wanna see grow

Bastards duckin' when Hov be buckin'
Chicken-heads be cluckin'
Back when ratchet was a ratchet and a vixen was a vixen
And Jam Master Jay was alive I was mixin'
Cookin' coke in the kitchen
Back when Rodman was a Piston
Mike was losin' to Isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one
Gave birth to my verbal imagination
Assume a virtue if you have not
Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet
""Lord, we know who we are
Yet we know not what we may be""
So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy
I'm from Marcy Houses, where the boys die by the thousand
Back when Pam was on Martin

When Slick Rick made ""Mona Lisa""

Pregnant pause, give you some second thoughts
There's room on the bandwagon, don't abort

Marcy me
Streets is my artery, the vein of my existence
I'm the Gotham City heartbeat
I started in lobbies now, parley with Saudis
Sufi to the goofies, I could probably speak Farsi
That's poetry, read a coca leaf from my past
Came through the bushes smellin' like roses
I need a trophy just for that

Fat laces in your shoe, I'm talkin' bustin' off the roof
Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke

Shout out to all the murderers turned murals

Shout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle
All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile
Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes
Thus concludin' my concerto; Marcy me

The gift and the curse
Uh Uh yeah
First they love me then they hate me
Then they love me again
Love me again
Lets take a trip down
I got y'all
Lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
Rain gray skies seems at the end of every young black live
It's this line damn him already
Such a goodkid got us poring Hen (nessy) already
Liquor to the curb for the niggas up above
When it cracks through to pavement that's my way of sending love
So give BIG a hug tell Aaliyah I said high
Till the next time I see her on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall nigga fought like us
Damn poor Isyss that his momma name momma ain't strong enough to raise no boy
What's his father name ?shorty never knew him though he had his blood in em
Hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with 'em so the streets raised em
Isyss blaming herself she wish she could have saved him
Damn near impossible only men can raise men
He was his own man not even him could save him
He put his faith in the 38 in his waist
But when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate
End up dead before 38 and a
That's the life of what's raised by a winter, it's a cold world
Old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
Isyss life just ended on that rainy day
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed down at the city mourge
Open the drawer saw 'em nude
Her addiction grew
Prescription drugs dipped in brew
Angel dust dipped in whoo
She slipped into her own fantasy world
Had her self pregnant by different dude
But reality bites and this is her life
He wasn't really her husband though he called her wife
It was just this night when the moon was full and the stars was just right
And the dress was real tight
And it sounded like Lisa Lisa I wonder if I take you home
Will you still love me after this night
Mike was the hard head from around the way that she wanted all her life
Shit she wanted all the hype
Used to hold on tight when they wheelied on the bike
He was a Willie all her life
He wasn't really the one to like
It was a dude named Shi
Who would really treat her right
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
But Isyss liked this broad way life
She loved the Gucci sneakers the red, green and, white
Hanging out the window when she first seen 'em fight
So turned on that she had to shower twice
How ironic it would be some fight
That would turn it to a homicide that would alter their life
See Mike at 32 was still on the seen
He had a son 15 that he never saw twice
Sure he saw him as an infant but he disowned him
Like if that was my son he would look much different
See I'm light skinned and that baby there's dark
So it's momma's baby poppa's maybe
Mike was still crazy out there running the streets
Had his old reliable 38 gun in his reach
He spent 14 years him and Isyss ain't speak
He runnin' around like life is a peach
Till one day he approached this thug
That had a mean mug
And he looked so familiar that he called um young 'Cause
Told 'em get off the strip but the boy ain't budge
Instead he pulled out a newer 38 snug
He clearly had to drop but the boy just paused
It was something in this man's face he knew he seen before
It's like looking in the mirror seeing his self more mature
He took it as a sign from the almighty lord
You know what they say about he who hesitates at war
(What's that) he who hesitates is lost
He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank
The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas be a father ya killing ya son
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas be a father ya killing ya son

The damage here along the gulf coast is catastrophic.
There's a frantic effort under way tonight to find
Survivors. There are an uncounted number of the dead tonight...
People are being forced to live like animals...
We are desperate...
No one says the federal government is doing a good job...
And hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people...
No water, I fought my country for years...
We need help, we really need help...
In Baghdad, they they drop, they air drop water, food to people... why can't they do that to their own people?
The same idiots that can't get water into a major American city in less than three days are trying to
Win a war...
(Verse 1 - Jay-Z)
People was poor before the hurricane came
But the down pour poured is like when Mary J. sang
Every day it rains, so every day the pain
But ignored them, and showed 'em the risk was to blame
For life is a chain, cause and effected
Niggas off the chain because they affected
It's a dirty game so whatever is effective
From weed to selling kane, gotta put that in effect
Wouldn't you loot, if you didn't have the loot?
Baby needed food and you stuck on the roof
Helicopter swooped down just to get a scoop
Through his telescopic lens but he didn't scoop you
The next five days, no help ensued
They called you a refugee because you seek refuge
The commander-in-chief just flew by
Did he stop? No, he had a couple seats
Just proved jet blue he's not
Jet flew by the spot
What if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped
Hu, That woulda been something to watch
Helicopters doing fly-bys to take a couple of shots
Couple of portraits then ignored 'em
He'd be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids
Poor kids just 'cause they were poor kids
Left 'em on they porches same old story in New Orleans
Silly rappers, because we got a couple Porches
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses
We forget the unfortunate
Sure I ponied up a mill, but I didn't give my time
So in reality I didn't give a dime, or a damn
I just put my monies in the hands of the same people that left my people stranded
Nothin' but a bandit
Left them folks abandoned
Damn, that money that we gave was just a band-aid
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis this is my minority report
Can't say we better off than we was before
In synopsis this is my minority report
(Verse 2 - Ne-Yo)
So many times I'm, covering my eyes
Peeking through my fingers
Tryin' to hide my, frustration at the way that we treat
(Seems like we don't even care)
Turn on the TV, seein' the pain
Sayin' such a shame
Then tryin' to go on with my life
Of that, I too, am guilty
(Seems like we don't even care)
So we send a lil' money, tell 'em it's all right
To be able to sleep at night
You will pay that price
While some of these folks' lost their whole life
(Seems like we don't even care)
Now it wasn't on the nightly news no more
Suddenly it didn't matter to you no more
In the end almost nothing changed
What the hell, what was that for?
(Seems like we don't even care)

Turn tha music up turn the lights down I'm in my zone
Thank god for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty - the world'll feel my truths
Through my hard knock life time my gift and the curse
I gave you volume after volume of my work so you can feel my truths
I built the dynasty by bein one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt (Y'all can't fill my shoes)
From my Blueprint beginnings to my black album ending
If you listen close you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga feel my truths
Pop died didn't cry didn't know him that well
Between him doin' heroin and me doin' crack sales
Put that in an eggshell, standing at the tabernacle rather the church
Pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like damn that man's face is just like my face
So pop I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
I wasn't all your fault homie you got caught
Into the same game I fought
That uncle ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re meet each other
Save a place in heaven for the next time we meet forever
The music business hate me cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be makin'
I dumbed down for my audience and double my dollars
They criticize me for it yet they all yell holla
If skillz sold truth be told,
I probably be - lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
(But I did 5 mil) I ain't been rhymin like Common Sense
When your sense got that much in common and you been hustlin' since
Your inception fuck perception go with what make sense
Since I know what I'm up against we as rappers must decide what is most impor-tant
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back to me that's a win win
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is workin just like them
(The rims that is)
My homie Sigel's on a tier where no tears should fall
'Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle all we do is ball
Till we all got triangles on our walls
They just rappin' for the platinum
Y'all record, I recall 'cause I really been there before
4 scores a seven years ago prepare for flow
Prepare for war I should fear no man
But you don't hear me though
These words ain't just paired to go in one ear and out the other ear no
Yo my balls and my words is alls I have
What you gonna do to me nigga a scars'll scab
What you gonna box me home I could dodge a jab
3 shots couldn't touch me thank god for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK nigga holla back"

And the only thing that's stoppin' him is you
Cause the only thing that he'll be droppin' is you

145,My 1st Song,2003,The Black Album (2003),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"(Intro: Notorious B.I.G. interview)
Well I'm basically tryin' to stay above water y'know
Just stay busy, stay workin
Puff told me like, the key to this joint
The key to staying, on top of things
Is treat everything like it's your first project, knahmsayin?
Like it's your first day like back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry
(Verse One: Jay-Z)
Uh, uh, yes, yes
Y'all wanna know, why he don't stop
Y'all wanna know, why he don't flop
Let me tell you pe-peeople why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out sellin dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some ""Just +Me, Myself and I+""
On some Trugoy shit
Had your boys threw place up, to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, till I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned
It's my life - it's my pain and my struggle
The song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as - when I came
It's my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me
It's my ev-ery-thing
(Verse Two: Jay-Z)
Like I never rode in a limo
Like I just dropped flows to a demo
Like it's ninety-two again and
And I got O's in the rental
Back in the Stu' again, no prob' livin' was a whole lot simpler
When you think back, you thought that
You would never make it this far, then you
Take advantage of the luck you handed
Or the talent, you been given
Ain't no, half steppin, ain't no, no slippin
Ain't no different from a block that's hidden
Gotta get it while the getting's good
Gotta strike while the iron's hot, 'fore you stop
Then you gotta bid it, good riddance
Goodbye, this is my second major breakup
My first was, with a pager
With a hooptie, a cookpot, and the GAME
This one's with the stool, with the stage, with the fortune
Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME
It's my life - my pain and my struggle
The song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as - when I came
It's my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me
It's my ev-ery-thing
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst like the first song I sang

So even in a racist mind, he's half right
If you have a racist mind, you be aight
My president is black, but his house is all white
Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk
Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run
Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly
So I'ma spread my wings, you can meet me in the sky
I already got my own clothes, already got my own shoes
I was hot before Barack, imagine what I'm gonna do
Hello Ms. America, hey pretty lady
Red, white and blue flag, wave for me, baby

Helped raise food, helped raise water so
God knows who can feed their son or their daughter
Say what I wanna say 'cause I'ma say, say it
Say what I'm gonna say 'cause I'm a taxpayer
Bill O'Reilly, eat a dick, nice try
You're really being a racist asshole in a nice tie
And tell Dennis Miller his show suck anyway
And I rather watch Jimmy Kimmel any day
I got some white friends and a white Benz
Parked out front and, yeah, also white rims
'Cept my president is black and I'ma be heard
Don't ever try to tell me now I can't say the b word

This is educated thug MU-SIC, niggaz
Life's a battle, mean streets eat you alive
Blocks'll have you, tryin' to maintain your course
Through the potholes and gravel
Hot holes and what-have-you, tryin' to clock dough
Foes tryin' to pop shots through you by code
Pigs tryin' to grab you and lock up your soul
Through the Hot Apple, nighttime shots crackle
(Bucka bucka bucka) Fiends tryin' to gaffle you
Not only cokeheads but the Feds in the Mercuray Topaz
After you, up the avenue
Tryin' to give you big numbers, you got math to do
Tryin' to make you miss summer, shit, that ain't cool
I caught smaller cases tryin' to get cap or two
Up against the wall, tryin' to pass through
Ghost-like, hear the cries from the tortured souls
Most nights, I hold my toast tight, and it goes like

Niggaz throwin' me shade, but ain't shit sunny
Hot shells only thing niggaz could get from me
Cocktails thrown in your living room, KA-BOOM
I'm so confrontational;
They shoulda never let me go on probation yo
I'm a hustler; except that...
No correctional facilities can correct that
I took a step back, I viewed myself, seen where my head was at
It's where that dough is homey, gotta get that
Gotta get away, some try but head back
Uh, street smart niggaz got left back
Some died, they left stacks
Me, I ball right, and on top of that I'm dog nice
Jigga been cold as fuck before ice

I held tears back, I gathered myself and stared back
I'm from where you don't crack, the weak don't live
You gotta bounce back homey, the streets don't give
I take and rape villages, who gon' stop him?
Not Rudy Guiliani, not Hillary Rodham
Still I still pop him
Shit I grassy knoll and hilltop him, it's all political now
I think big when I spit at you now
Between my dog and the figures, the four gonna get'cha
Between life and death, they killed my spirit
So what little life I got left, y'all can expect me to ball
I ? myself, teacher said I was a lost cause
'Cause I used to roam them halls
Still I spit knowledge, dropped out of high school, skipped college
Who woulda thought I'd make it ""Big"" like Ms. Wallace?

Mac-11, I squeeze like lemon limes
Squirt, obey your thirst, fashion lines
Between beauty and beast, I walk the line
, I'm a real G
I cut my self today to see if I still bleed
Success is so sublime
Gotta do that time to time so I don't lose my mind
Something 'bout the struggle so divine
This sort of love is hard to define
When you scratching for every nickel and dime
Got me itching to do this shit for my mom
Do this shit for my town
Leave the door open hoping they kick it down
The purist form of giving is anonymous to anonymous
We gonna make it there, I promise this
Nickels and dimes
Sticks to my mind
I'll never win
You have my friends
Sometimes I feel survivor's guilt
I gave some money to this guy, he got high as hell
Now I'm part of the problem far as I could tell
Did I do it for him or do it for myself
Can't lie to myself
I love my niggas more than my own blood
I die for my niggas and I love my cub, hope that's not fucked up
I got a problem with the handouts, I took the man route
I'll give an opportunity though, that's the plan now
No guilt in giving clear a nigga conscience out
No guilt in receiving, every thing within reason
Can't see it taking food out my little monster's mouth
That will drive me gaga
Run up in your mama's house, two nickels, one dime
Manslaughter charges, the lawyer, knocked it down
I'm just trying to find common ground
'Fore 
 come and chop a nigga down

Hublot homie, two door homie
You don't know all the shit I do for the homies
Nickels and dimes
Sticks to my mind
I'll never win
You have my friends
Pardon my hubris, Stanley Kubrick
With eyes wide shut, I could cook up two bricks
Turn nickels to dime, turn dimes to quarters
Turn wives from daughters, oh, I'm clear as water
And just for clarity, my presence is charity
My flow is a gift, philanthropist
Everybody around me rich or will be
Baby boy I promise you this or kill me
And when a nigga go as the old adage go
You die rich or you die a disgrace, so just let me grow
Watch me cook, throw no looks
Like Magic in his prime when Kareem sky hooked
Y'all not worthy, sometimes I feel like
Y'all don't deserve me, my flow unearthly

(
) Recognize bitch, Jay to the motherfuckin' Z
Got a condo with nothin' but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroll
See how I was flowin' on my last cassette
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin a Tec, never jam though
Never get high, never run out of ammo
Niggas hatin' 'n' shit 'cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're, actin' raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your hoe, wanna marry your hoe
Now she's mad at me, causer Your Majesty, just happened to be
A pimp with a tragedy
She wanted, us to end, 'cause I fucked with friends
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, ""Shit...
There's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!""
Gotta friend that even though I been better
Left him in the cold with a thin sweater
Rap niggas on Prozac get the bozack
Niggas threw two at me I threw fo' back, hold that
Let the dough stack, way before Big had the gold Ac'
Dame had the Lex black
Motherfuckers wanna test that, stress that
And right where you're stressed, where you rest at
I suggest that, niggas invest, in a vest, when I come through
With the glock jet black, you niggas step back
I'm the best at, you know I ain't no apprentice to this
Me and my niggas we invented the shit
I came into the business with this
The Originator, none greater, Jaz-O finish this shit
:
Better learn, Jaz don't relax, stat ever heard of me
Worldwide Originator, say word to me
The population holla certainly
I burn a nigga like a third degree
See me shine so bright, nigga I'm my light
Runnin' all over with rigor and vigor
Nobody bigger than me and my nigga Jigga
You fly-by-nights stop jerkin beef
Heavyweights type work to me
For the time, in this motherfucker ain't nobody hurtin' me
What? Cut your face in like surgery
Who the fuck got a VS, fuckin' BM's on the road
When you had to be in bed at the PM
Leave the info, Jaz on the seat, and then
Forever touchin my workers beginnin you're endin
Nigga your style's no style my style's hostile
C'mon, faggot nigga down to take the gun home
O-R-I-G-I-N-A-T-O-R (Can't fuck with it can ya!)
Chorus (with variations)

The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work, family never forgetting where we came from
(Jay-Z)
Poor me, dad was gone, finally got my dad back
Liver bad he wouldn't live long, they snatched my dad back
Guidence I never had that, streets was my second home
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at
A place to study math at, matter fact I learned it all
Burnt it all this music is where I bury the ashes at
Flash back not having much, not having that
Had to get some hollabread you can holla back at
Holla that my jewish lawyer do enjoy the fruit of within my cash stack
Just in case a nigga got to use his rat-ta-ta-ta-tat
Own boss own yacht, masters, slave
The mentality I carry with me to this very day
Fuck rich let's get wealthy who else gon' feed we
If I need it imma get it however God help me
(And I don't need no hook for this shit!)
I'm so for sure it's no facade
Stay out of trouble, momma said as momma sighed
Her fear her youngest son being victim of homocide
But I got to get you out of here momma or imma---die
Inside---and either way you lose me momma so let loose of me
I got the reign our direction'll soon change
To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game
Hustle 'caine, hustle clothes, or hustle music
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick
Skinny nigga toothpick but, but I do lift
Weight like I'm using 'roids rolls royce
Keep my movements smooth while manuvering
Through all the manure in the sewers that I grew up in
Choi-ces we make trying to escape
(And I don't need no hook for this shit!)
This is not for commercial usage
Please don't categorize this is music
Please don't compare me to other rappers
Compare me to trappers I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris
And Luda's my dude I ain't trying to diss
Like Frank Lucas is cool but I ain't trying to snitch
Imma follow the rules no matter how much time imma get
Imma live and die with the decisions that imma pick
So fuck the haven for cave in, that's why we don't speak
Made men ain't supposed to make statements
End of the story I followed the code cracked the safe
Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate
Leave that boy Hov alone why don't ya
You don't have to if you don't want to but don't say I didn't warn ya
Oh (And I don't need no hook for this shit!)"

To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea, yea)

to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye

From record sales, to sold out concerts
So muh'fucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the under toe, just caught in the undertow) (Mike)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the under toe, just caught in the undertow) (Mike)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you
Become so numb

Took tunnel vision, but he would soon become a mogul
But first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo
Don't play with my yo-yo, loco niggas in the hood
First niggas hating on me, it's all good
I'm buying things like my shit don't stink, Gucci links in Gucci goose's
Watching too many movies, bulletproof this
Had some nerve, like pulling tooth'ses
When your 16, coming through roofless
Yeah your boy ""ruthless"", like Ice Cube was
Turn the whole city on, I'm the new blood
So if this is your first time hearing this
You're about to experience someone so cold
A journey seldom seen, the American dream
From the bottom to the top of the globe they call me Hov
They gunning for me, wanna see me fall
You know my story, I've been through it all
Night's I've felt like dying, but I ain't crying
What didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
Iron, iron (Oh my God, Hov)
Now I'm knee deep in the concrete
Like a street's made a quicksand, it's beyond deep
I got a ""chemical romance"", two left feet
So now I dance with the devil, please G-O-D
Save me from the ""black parade"", release me
My life like Grant Theft Auto, PSP
I'm in that Volvo, puffing on that la-la
Ducking from the po-po, every time I drive by
Say hi to the bad guy, all my momma's friends was like
""Mmm, mmm, mmm"" would you just look at him
So sorry dear momma for your embarrassment
But give me a couple years and pray I'll never sin again
Got all these rival dealers trying to do me in
And all these little rappers don't know how prepared for them I am (I am)
I'm feelin' like the world's against me Lord
Call me crazy, but strangely I love the odds
Now these baby ballers, toy rappers/toy wrappers
Callin out my name to bring the boy backwards
Shooting air-balls at the basket
What you call money, I pay more in taxes
I got crowned king down in Africa
Out in Niger, do you have any idea
Sold out shows out in Seoul, Korea
Jo'burg, Dublin, Tanzinia
Lunch with Mandella, dinner with Cavalli
Still got time to give water out to everybody

Fuck what you say, boys in blue say
[Beyoncé]
I don't care if you on the run
Baby, long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing lose
[Jay-Z]
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tatts, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off, if things ring off
My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty
My lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby mama harder then a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know its till the death, I hope it obvi to niggas
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'mma wave this tech, I'mma geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack
Push your ma'fucka wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi
She was a good girl till she knew me
Now she is in the drop bussin' U'e, screaming
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing lose
[Jay-Z]
Deeper then words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring me a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it
[Beyoncé]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
I don't care I will never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear, never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it all away
Without you I got nothing to lose"

Welcome to the party life
These girls dressin' skintight...
Welcome to the 70's--sweet!
Ordered some patreezy
While talkin' to this breezy
Brushin' off my three-piece, I make this look too easy
So tall and lanky, my suit?
It should thank me
I make it look good to be this hood, meyer lansky
Look what lucky left me
Gangster, effortlessly
Poppa was a rolling stone-its in my ancestry
I'm in a whole 'nother league, niggas never catch me
And I sport fly shit, I should win the espy
(Baby i, I said I sport fly shit, I should win the espy...
I'm really in another league, babe...
I got a slick mouth, you might wanna roll with me,)
I'm on her bra strap, she's on my diiiick
Ain't nothin' wrong with that, that's my biiiitch

So all you niggas fall back, I'll split ya wig
She's my little quarterback ...ya dig?
'Cause I'm all that in the sack ...ya, ya dig?

Foiled it if you fakin', jack
She's used to million-dollar vacations
Fuck y'all gon' do with that?

No, my castle
I'm a hassa, no I'm an asshole
I'm never satisfied, can't knock my hustle
I wanna Rothko, no I wanna brothel, no
I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
Let's make love on a million in a dirty hotel
With the fan on the ceiling
All for the love of drug dealing
Marble floors, gold ceilings
Oh what a feeling
Fuck it, I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of
Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMA
Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma
Oh what a feeling
Picasso Baby, Ca Picasso baby
Ca ca ca Picasso Baby, Ca ca ca Picasso baby
Oh what a feeling
Picasso Baby, Ca Picasso baby
Ca ca ca Picasso Baby, Ca ca ca Picasso baby
It ain't hard to tell I'm the new Jean Michel
Surrounded by Warhols, my whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel
I just wanna live life colossal
Leonardo Da Vinci flows
Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes
See me thrown at the Met
Vogue'ing on these niggas, champagne on my breath, yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
Because I be going ape at the auction
Oh what a feeling
Aw fuck it, I want a trillion
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner
Go ahead lean on that shit Blue, you own it

Oh what a feeling

Okay, I never stuck my cock in the fox's box but
Damned if I didn't open Pandora's box
They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Miranda don't stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like old man just stop
I could if I would but I can't, I'm hot
And you blow, I'm still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth
The cameras pops niggas is cool with it
Till the canons pop
Now my hand on the bible
On the stand got your man in a jam, again
Got my hands in cuffs
I'm like god damn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin, piece skin rupture spleens
Cracks rips go through cribs and other things
No sympathy for the king huh
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me
Come through with 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO
Though I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gonna to take for me to go
For y'all to see
I'm the modern day Pablo

I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one...
Hit me!
(You got 'em Mike?)
He's got the rat patrol on the gat patrol
Foes who wanna make sure his casket's closed
Rap critics who say he's ""money, cash, hoes""
He's from the hood, stupid— what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your ""zapatos""
You'd be celebratin' the minute you was havin' dough
So fuck critics— you can kiss our whole asshole
You don't like the lyrics, you can press fast forward
Beef with radio if we don't play their show
They don't play our hits— we don't give a shit, so!
All these mags trying to use our ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads— fuckers
I don't know what you take us as...
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
From rags to riches— we ain't dumb
We got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one...
Hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one...
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one...
The year is '94— in my trunk is raw
In the rearview mirror it's the motherfuckin' law
I got two choices, ya'll:
Pull over the car or... bounce on the devil
Put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with ""Jake""
Plus I got a few dollars, I could fight the case
So I... pull over to the side of the road and I heard:
""Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind-reader, sir? I don't know!
Am I under arrest, or should I guess some mo'?""
""Look, I ain't steppin' outta shit, all my paper's legit!""
""Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back—
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that...""
""Hah! I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit...
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit!""

Now once upon a time, not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
This is not a hoe in the sense of ""havin' a pussy""
But ""a pussy havin' no god damn sense"", tryin' to push me
I tried to ignore him and talk to the Lord
Pray for him, 'cause some fools just love to perform
You know the type— loud as a motor bike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a food fight
The only thing that's gonna happen is I'mma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gon' be yappin' to the captain
And there I go, trapped in the kit-kat again
""Back through the system with the riff-raff"" again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' them
D.A. try to give a nigga [the] shaft again
Half-a-mil for bail, 'cause I'm African
All because this fool was harrassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems— bein' a bitch ain't one
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one...
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one...
Hit me!

And we gon' stay showin off that jewelry that we bought
And we gon' stay leavin' out the stores with heavy bags
'Cause we poppin' tags, pimpin' we be poppin' tags!
(Verse One: Jay-Z)
We arose, let's go
""So Fresh So Clean"" like 'Kast
Jay-Z be poppin' tags
Leavin' the mall with heavy bags
You know the boy got a love for the cash
Aw fuck, there he go again
Talkin' bout hoes and dough again
Yup! -- Can't hold it in
I'm surprised I got so much dough to spend
But, back when I was poorer then
You wasn't focusin, about the dough I spend
But I was holdin' in, I was a roller then
I was a baller back then, all of that man
Fall back, I fought that
What would you do if you was in my shoes?
Leave dudes in the rearview
V-12 engine, corners spinnin
Twinkies shinin, pinky ring
Armadale, nigga stinky stink
Top, down, my cash is up
Gold chain, I don't give a fuck
Gold brain'll get you in the truck ma
That's right, you in luck ma
You see me cruisin down, better step inside
Ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
First come, first served basis
You know Hov' be goin' to nice places
That's right, and I'm droppin' cash
Leave the mall with garbage bags
Gucci this, Prada that
Roll witcha boy you'll be poppin' tags
(Verse Two: Twista)
It's a party when I go up in the sto'
Shoppin' while I'm zooted off the dro'
Rollin' like a nigga that just came up on a mill'
And I got 'em sweepin and pickin' up tags off the flo'
Bag full of clothes I remember havin' rocks in the hall
On the glimmer with the glock by the ball
Servin' up a jab and workin security 6 to 6
Then it's straight from the block to the mall
Now what's on the wall? Go ahead and treat yo'self
When you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag
Like when I dip off in the Prada then I go off
To the lot lay the paper down and cop that Jag
I got a console full of ammunition and funds
Mink Roc-a-Wear and some guns
Petty in a fresh pair of jumps, blo-packs and Bo Jax
And Air Maxes, throw back some ones, no max for none
(When I go up in the sto' a nigga never get enough)
I'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now
(Nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up)
And the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now
I be choppin up cheddar with Kanye
Chop a little cheddar up with Jay
Chop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay
Poppin' big tags with the flow and the dough, we get bi-zay!

My throwback game is whiffle wicked
Saint Patties day, green pinstripe, number 20 Mark Spitz'n
Jersey ooh-wee with the matchin' Nu*Wear fitted
White boys say my style is bitchin
Keepin' coke in the kitchen
Keep a glock that will shock and bring the rest
Tucked underneath my Michelin S
I, travellin, handlin with a forty-five cannon
It's tucked in my Marc Buchanan
Extra clips and shells in the lambskin
Two deep by Pelle Pelle
Westside how they felly fell
More G's on me, than a late 80's Gucci leather
Worn by the great Rakim himself
Stitch my Dapper Dan oh man with the gun in hand
I leave your blood squirting
No offense, I'll put your face on the chest
Of a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings
I been fucking, a hustle, married to a racket
Since the first Air Jordan's and Starter jackets
I slept with a package, under mattress
I carry guns heavy speakeasy, slight with the fight words
I'll put somethin' hot through your motherfuckin iceberg
Got a project chica, named Rica
She keep a purse full of dro' reefer
Small, pinkies like that
Talk till the paper fat
I rock somethin', roll chief +Sacks+ like Daddy Fat!
(Verse Four: Big Boi)
Pop tires in reverse, you'll be needin a nurse
Leave you layin on your back in a Cadillac hearse
Now your momma in all black with a matchin' purse
I know you wanna blow up, but a funeral hurts
What's worse, you can hit the mall and ball till you fall
Have to make a collect call, but your cell cut off
Trot to the mailbox thinkin' a check but the mail's run short
No more MD, DD, LD
That means Movie Date, Dinner Date, Lunch Date, help me please
My sheets is gone
Long bread to the short bread, word is bond
Meticulously pimpously serve the song
Act a damn donkey
Like the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the indians home
Drop top rag-o with the weed gone
Chillin', bags in the trunk full of FEO Schwartz for the chill'uns
Spent a few shillings
Sip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kiddin
A fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and
Can you pop the tags on the honeycombs
Or are you actin' mad cause the money done
Slowed, down, just a little bit
Dipped, poked out, did some shull-bit
Actin' like a pitfall bull-pit
Dead game is the pul-pit
Leave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped
Imperial classic, a lyrical thrashin
A miracle happenin'
Jay-Z, Killer Mike and Big Boi rappin' and rhymin and smabbin
Pop that tag on some of this game

I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennedy's
Frank Sinatra havin' dinner with the Genovese'
This is the genesis of a nemesis
Mother America not witnessed since
The Harlem Renaissance birthed black business
This is the tale of lost innocence
And the incense burns and the turntables turn
And that Al Green plays
I see my mother's afro
As mama taps her toes
As she rolls her J's
And my papa just left the house
In search of a killer of my uncle Ray
And she's trying to calm her nerves
As I observe this is just one day
And what tomorrow has in store
We can never be sure
As all we can do is... pray
As I head to my homeroom
I observe the ruins
Dope needles on the ground
I hear a car go vroom
Drug dealer in the BM with the top down
As the girls start to giggle
I ask why you laugh?
They say you're too little
One day you'll understand
When you become a man
'Bout things you have to get you
Fast forward freeze frame
On my pistol fistful of dollars
Ignorance is so blissful
I ain't choose this life
This life chose me
Around here it's the shit
That you just do
I just left school
The same BM is pulled over
By the boys dressed blue
They had their guns drawn
Screaming ""Just move""
Or is there something else you suggest we can do?
He made his way to the trunk
Opened it like ""Huh""
A treasure chest was removed
Cops said he'll be back next month
What we call corrupt
He calls payin' Dues
Now when the rules is blurred
As they is and were
What am I supposed to do but... pray
Pray the Lord forgive me
Pray He guides me for what I'm 'bout to go through...
Pray
Anywhere there's oppression
The drug profession
Flourishes like beverages
Refreshing, sweet taste of sin
Everything I seen made me everything I am
Bad drug dealer of victim, I beg
What came first
Moving chickens of the egg?
This is why I be so fresh
I'm trying to beat life
'Cause I can't cheat death
Treat shame like shamelessness
Aim, stainless at anuses
You know the game this is
Move coke like Pepsi
Don't matter what the brand name is
I stand behind mine
Everything I do I'm a man behind mine
I'm not an angel, I'm sure
But every night before I lay
I drop my knees to the floor
And I pray"

All over me while you ridin' the beep beep

Pull up to the club on them 23's

We shop, like we all broke detention
Club like we at a alcoholic's convention
Hit the 'tel with two chicks and she with it
Mama got down like the flo' when she did it
Pretty girls, keep shakin ass now mama

I guess even back then you can call me,
C.E.O of the R.O.C HOV,
Fresh out the frying pan into the fire,
I be the, music biz number 1 supplier
Flier than a piece or paper bearing my name,
Got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain, that's right HOV
Not D.O.C, similar to the letters no one can do it better
I check cheddar like a food inspector,
My homie Strip to me dude finish yo breakfast,
So that's what I'ma do take you back to the dude with the Lexus fast forward the jewels and the necklace,
Let tell you dudes what I do to protect this,
Shoot at you actors like movie directors
(Ha-Ha This ain't a movie dog)
Now before I finish let me just say I did not come here to show out, I did not come here to impress you because tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE and I don't care what you think about me but just remember when it hits the fan brother whether its next year, ten years, twenty years from now you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK.

Ving ain't lie, I done came through the block in everything that's fly,

By any means on wheneva there's a drought get yo umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm,
U can blame Sean but I ain't invent the game,
I just rolled the dice trying to get some change,
And I do it twice ain't no since of me lying as if I am a different man,
And I can blame my emviroment but there ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains.
I hope you don't think user are the only abusers niggas gettin' high within the game.
If you do then how would you explain I'm ten years a move, still the vibe is in my veins.
I gotta hustler spirit, nigga period.
Check at my hat yo peep the way I wear it,
Check at my swag yo I walk like a ball player,
No matter where you go you are what you are player,
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer,
Man you was who you was for you got hair,
Only GOD can judge me so I'm gon,
Either love me or leave me alone.

I-I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown.
Hands down mami had the bombest pussy in town.
One dip in the girl pool, thatz all it took.
One sample of the snappa and ya ass was whooped.
Have you buyin Gucci sandals matchin' pocketbooks.
Blowin' up her beeper, ringin' her phone off the hook.
Ball playaz they spent money, rappers they spent time.
All the while both claimin that they never spent a dime.
Buisness guys you were victimised.
Have 'em payin' rent on condos in a Miami High Rise.
They ask her, ""Who pussy's this?""
Look her right in her eyes.
She say, ""This pussy's yours, Daddy""
Tell 'em nothin' but lies.
Ha! They didn't believe it, but they wanted to.
Needed to. She had the type of body that you didn't want leavin' you.
So they ignored all her flirtin ways and put a ring on her finger.
I'm like, ""Earth to Dave!""

While y'all chumps be coppin diamonds and fur and all that,
Fiendin for this pussy as if y'all was on crack.
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back.
Y'all cats (?) hittin these broads need to be smacked.
It's this nigga named Monroe that I know from way back.
He hit the lotto, bought this girl a Cadillac.
Now this bitch be creepin' behind this niggaz back.
Me bust his nut guess what he still took this bitch back.
Three things niggaz love... money, pussy, and drugs.
Can't get one without the other unless you soft and in love.
Y'all take it from a nigga who's done all the above.
Niggaz it the lesbian R&B thug.

Her father called my house he said,
""I need to talk to yo son Devin.
My daughter she's 11 and she goes to the same school that yo son goes to.
And she said today she got screwed.""
But my daddy answer the phone so no drama, and all he said was,
""No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!""
Then I was suspended 3 day, tooken from school.
It was like a vacation.
Niggaz lookin' at pussy at the pool in our apartments.
I started hittin hard when I was small.
Let me recite a story lesson for all of y'all.
See pussy's like a wound it would never heal,
The more ointment you put on then the better it feels.

Like the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area
Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit
Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio
Let 'em test the product, give 'em a promo show
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
Then we drop a maxi single and charge 'em two for five
Ain't tryin' to, kill 'em at first just, buildin clientele

With my peoples high to GM, from a remote lo-cation
In the BM, scopin the whole situation like, ""Dayamm!""
Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cre-am
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read em, the windows to his soul
Are half closed, I put the key in
Pulled off slow, hopin my people flee-in
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin dope for dollars
Make me wanna, holler back at the crib in the sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time/Warner
Awaitin call, from his kin not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets
This time... stress... givin' this shit up... fuck
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the, rise to the top, many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
And through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
As sure as this, Earth is turning souls burning
In search of higher learning turning in every direction seeking direction
My moms cryin cause her insides are dyin'
Her son tryin' her patience, keep her heart racin
A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit
But it's this game love, I'm caught up all in it
They make it so you can't prevent it, never give it
You gotta take it, can't fake it I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shakin, 'cause I sense danger
Like Camp Crystal Lake and
Don't wanna shoot him, but I got him, trapped
Within this infrared dot, bout to hot him and, hit rock bottom
No answers to these trick questions, no time shit stressin
My life found I got ta live for the right now
Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands
Once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets
You used to hold me, told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets... (when I was young)

When he was here he was crazy nice with his son
I miss him, long as I'm livin' he's livin' through memories
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
In heaven lookin' over me, or in hell, keepin' it cozy

Say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels (bling bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news - with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade; you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
Pop toasters, and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
Mommy's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it - not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt

Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference - they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didn't experiment?
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders - too bad you couldn't do good at marriage!
(Ha ha!) And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't
Think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo

About anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING), RENEGADE!
[Jay] Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at, any given time of day
'Cause I'm a {RENEGADE} Never been afraid to holler
About anything {anything?} Anything {ANYTHING!}
(Jay-Z)
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Doo-rag wrappin my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me - I'm awkward, I box leftier often
My pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown; 'specially on nights
I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor - thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics; raisin' my head to the sky
BIG I did it - multi before I die (nigga)
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
(Eminem)
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter - a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie
While I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin spiteful, DELIGHTFUL eyeful
The new Ice Cube - motherfuckers HATE to like you
What did I do? (huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' this butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a muh'fuckin'
[Chorus] - repeat 2X"

Fuck -- shit is real right here
Roc-a-Fella, LOX, takin' the streets over motherfuckers
Don't get it twisted
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
Yo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass
With no mask, look at the camera like what?
Yeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed
To the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy
Drop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin' for a deal
If I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids
I ain't straight till my numbers match the Motorola ?bid?
And walk the streets up in ? ? like I don't fuckin' care
If I ain't strapped that means I took 'em off my Nike Airs
Get off mine, y'all talk shit like little children
When I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building
'Cause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores
Jet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores
I make it hot, floodin your block, the best way
Professionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray
As I get roasted lookin' at Biggie posted on my wall
Takin' shots of Louie till I fall
Nuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove
And kick rhymes to the poster, till I swear Big move
My team, you would think was on Thorazine
How we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing
(Beanie Sigel)
Yo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now
Pick out a quiet town and tie it down
Make niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now
Beanie Mac I supply it now
My squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats
Couple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps
Bag enough coke to last a few weeks
In case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats
You really wanna test my name? And test my game?
Until you have me, test my aim?
Y'all niggaz nuts, like testricles
Hit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule
Perhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin'
Heat from the noggin, keep on sparkin
Platinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin
Cop off the lot never see me at the auction
Pint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin
Out on the strip, until I reach the margin
Not tryin' to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct
Eatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend
Locked up with dirty white boys and Ricans
(Jadakiss)
Now if I kill you I probably do ten in the box
Come down on appeal then I'm killin' your pops
You feelin' The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX
If this rap shit don't work niggaz still in the spot
You bring it to me, I gotta lose your family
Gangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami
Shit is deep now dog but it gets deeper
Fuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper
I put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag
You gon' try it, y'all niggaz can't deny it
Lot of cats still tryin' to study my last bounce
Tell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce
They got me where I can't be without my large gat
Teflon long sleeve, and my hardhat
Don't matter if I'm openin up, or headline
Doin' the speed limit or pushin red lines
Six months in the county or fed time
I'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime
Anything I'm on is a classic, any nigga
Ever had beef with, son is a bastard
Anytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X.
Ruffryder you heard? We got the game mastered
I told you the pain was comin'
You wouldn't listen
You tried to play me like a joke?
Now who got the last laugh?
Now take these bullets with you to hell
(Sauce Money)
You motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit
So many niggaz on my nuts I thought I lost my dick
Picture me fallin' off, I'm camera shy
Hammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die
What's the difference? Either way I'm stunnin your crew
I fuck to win, y'all niggaz comin' to lose
Somethin' to prove? Spit it, we can have a sprayoff
I lay off wet niggaz and kill 'em on my day off
Ain't nuttin for me to bust a trey off
Murder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off
Run with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews
Now I concentrate on your camp, like Jews
Flow hot like a heatwave bitch
Whips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with
I'm a meal stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin
For you Phil Jackson niggaz on that Bull
(Styles)
I don't give a FUCK who you are, so FUCK who you are
I don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
I don't care about your block and whoever you shot
I don't care about your album and whenever it drop
I don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked
I'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash
Far as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggaz
Shootin backwards, just for practice
Ride or die nigga, hoppin in your casket
Bout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you
Tell the whole world I'm spittin' let 'em know the shells hit you
I tell niggaz quick, suck dick and get a glock
My name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock
I'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
You know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
I ruffryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella
Jay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella
(Jay-Z)
I know pop you can't stand us cause you cock them hammers
Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna
Whoa... watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners
Like raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brained in the four dot six Range
Shit main, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain
Muh'fukas is noddin and throwin' up, you know that
You don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak man
Gotta, love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money till I'm above the law
How the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses
We don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga
Multiple cars and divas with D-classes
Iceberg sweat with I.B. on the elastic
Shit, beyotch! What the fuck, ya heard me?
Put some more beat on that joint"

When I, do it I do's it, ain't no more to it (word)
Ask (?) I puts my back into it
From car dealers to Macy's, to cashiers that brace me
We train like the Navy for whatever the case may be
I pass on the 6, they don't impress me much
I want the bulletproof 7 cause the doors lift up
They pick the best of all girls, so how y'all sound?
I got the best of both worlds, holdin' me down

185,She's Coming Home With Me,2004,Unfinished Business (2004),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Fellas, a few tips, when you're in the club
You must watch your girl, because she may end up with me
TrackMasters (uh... turn the music up)
Rock Land
Hova (woo! yess, yess)
Now somebody's girl is in my mansion
Shakin that ass to this
And somebody's girl is in my hot tub
Drinkin' that glass of Crist'
And somebody's girl is in my bedroom
And man she's a superfreak
And somebody's girl is leavin' my crib
Now on to the next booty
Ummmmmmmmm, I don't mean no harm
But your boy got the magic stick, the Don Juan
Bishop, chicks'll disappear in thin air
Like mist or some shit like this I swear
I take handcuffs off misses, I pick locks wicked
I catch your eye cause my tick-tock's frigid
My necklace glisten, all reckless chicks is
Eyeballin, yeah, and I caught 'em like perfect pitches
Call me Mike Piazza
Once I get 'em in, my fly casa
It's hot tubs, heated pools and no rules
Call your old dude and tell him he old news
Tell that fella you feel like Cinderella
With both shoes and it's almost two
Fuck a storybook endin, we bendin the rules
This is somebody's girl part two, now move
Now somebody's girl is in my mansion
Shakin that ass to this
And somebody's girl is in my hot tub
Drinkin' that glass of Crist'
And somebody's girl is in my bedroom
And man she's a superfreak
And somebody's girl is leavin' my crib
Now on to the next booty
Uh, let me at it
Somebody's girl is sittin' in my lap
Whisper two words and we both break out
My Maybach seats is just as big as a couch
Not the same girl now that the mic's at your mouth
Oh that's gettin' nasty, let's get naughty
Rollin' around like a fo'-wheel afterparty
We stop at a red light, there go your girls an' 'em
Now we got the green light, driver follow them (let's go)
You're rotatin with a guy that spend money like the world spin 'round
First guy to ever put the singin' rap down
Say the name Kels and these chicks spellbound
Because these chicks know I put the ""12Play"" down
I gotta have it, I just can't stop limpin
Maybe because I just can't stop pimpin'
No matter what I do, I can't stop leanin
When the fresh Prada's on and the sun is shinin
Girls it's your boyfriend
With that remix that keeps you clubbin
Dis collabo' crack got you fiendin
The industry kings and the rest is dreamin'
Now somebody's girl is in my mansion
Shakin that ass to this
And somebody's girl is in my hot tub
Drinkin' that glass of Crist'
And somebody's girl is in my bedroom
And man she's a superfreak
And somebody's girl is leavin' my crib
Now on to the next booty
The moral of the tale, if you love your tail
Treat her well, keep her 'way from Hov' and Kel'
Because we can't stop pimpin'
We put it on her till she can't stop limpin
She'll be a goner, you can play tough guy on the corner
I smoothe her out in the sauna
Yeah, I blew it out in the Bahamas, yeah
Your lil' mama got a stellar arm
We got it on like a telethon
Mr. Roc-A-Fella, gone
Now somebody's girl is in my mansion
Shakin that ass to this

Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cris stylin', yeah
Kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see a sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

Good times never fade away, smile

Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it's a blessin'

I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin'
A nigga up in the hundreds of millions
I have no ceilings, ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy""
Slappin' out of the toy, the separation is clear
In my rear-view mirror, objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair
Playin' for high stakes
Norman Cake, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
Chargin' my own fate
Respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours
Niggas only own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money, I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss's habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Paris
All y'all jewelers should be embarrassed, huh
Blood diamonds drippin' with guilt
I still ain't trippin', that's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Perhaps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain
I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ah, what did I do?
'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs
Heroin flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian
Don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed?
I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Fear for you, bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga's freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado
Yeah, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile
(Outro: Gloria Carter)
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

This a special dedication
I wanna thank you for the fuel
No really thank you
(Verse 1 - Jay-Z)
I felt so inspired by what my teacher said
Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head
Now sure if that's how adults should speak to kids
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class
I'll teach his ass
Even betters what my uncle did
I pop my demo tape in start to beat my head
Peaked out my eye, see if he was beating his
He might as well say beat it kid, he's on the list
It's like I'm searching for kicks like a sneaker head
He gon keep pushing me until I reach the ledge
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell 'em all to eat a dick
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread
Spread spread
(Chorus - Pharrell)
Motivation for me was them telling me what I could not be, oh well
I'm so ambitious
I might hit two sisters
Hey I'm on a mission
No matter what the conditions
Forget the personal issues
When you been what I been through
Hey if you believe it
Then you could conceive it
(Verse 2 - Jay-Z)
I had to lace up my boots even harder
Father is too far away to father
Further-more of the kids either smoke reefer
Or either move white, there's few writers in my cipher
So they made lighter, my type a dreams seem dumb
They said wiser, how many guys a you see making it from here
The world don't like us, is that not clear, a riper
I'm different, I can't base what I'm gonna be off a what everybody isn't,
They don't listen, just whispering behind my back
No vision, lack of ambition
So wack!
(Verse 3 - Jay-Z)
Had a couple of meetings no office yet
Maybe I ain't good enough for these offices
Back to the drawing board ducking officers
It's all good cause the streets is A&R'ing this
So with or without any of your involvement
Coming for all of this, respect my conglomerate
I went from pauper to the President
Every deal I made said President
Niggas thought I'd fall without old buddy
Oh buddy, what I do is make more money
Dear Teacher, your probably somewhere near a speaker
I'm balling outta control, can you hear my sneakers

Could niggaz be scheamin on me? Probably are
Think Jigga's a joke nigga? Hardy har
I spit Brook-Brook-Brooklyn every time I bust
Radio's gotta play me though I cuss too much
Magazine said I'm shallow, I never learned to swim
Still they put me on they cover 'cause I earn for them
Soon as I sell too much, watch them turn on him
Cause that seem to be the shit that'll earn for them
I spit that murder-murder-murderous every time a verbalist
Iller than Verbal Kint is or O-Dog in ""Menace""

I deserve every blessin', I received I'm from the dirt, I...
Planted my seed on unfertile land

20 Ni**as on the block tryin' chase that buck...
Nusey neighbors and the haters keep their face on stuck,
Cops roll up on the pavement breaks the dice games up,
Behind smoke kids can't chase the ice cream truck,
Girls fightin' over Rollie young hype things up,
Ni**as fightin' over Colder young boys light things up.
All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up,
Remember Lil' Eddie Draw man I ain't like mean up,
Then they wonder why we like green up,
Back to back steam up
Tryin' to relax but I can't lean up
In the L or the repha that steamer that steam up is my head,
Stress to the point I get a fever...
Think about the block
And all the mothers and their kids that can't
Leave and how the chinks gotta feed 'em...
For the rest of their life fuckin'
Wings, fried vegetable rice...
{Gotta be kiddin'} no breakfest Cap'n Crunch at night.
Our kids eatin' lunch at night
In their beds all bunched an tight...
No less then 3 or 4...

Man I'm gettin' scared y'all I feel for them
{Yeah I know} gotta grip the shorties on the block
All they do is smoke weed and drink 40's...
Cop their lower quarties
Nough to get the latest ROC, newest glock, & old jordies.

Workin' inside a slump house starvin' to death
Servin' these ni**as flippers
Quarter ounces in zippers

Situation is critic
I was out here to get it
Livin' it like a savage
Cause ni**a I gotta have it
Holdin' back on the mothers for a minute, pumpin' hard dog,
Erase enough to walk it down and fuck it all dog,

""Me Against the World,"" ""All Eyez on Me""
Y'all niggaz got me feelin' like all eyes on me, me against the world
Mmm, y'all got me on my shit
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I did to this game
Bein that, I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
Come from the same hood you come from
We share basically the same stories
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I came and did
Since ninety-six, every year
Somethin' must be seriously wrong with the world
I know y'all ain't hatin'
(Some people hate!) Don't tell me niggaz is hatin'
(Some people hate!) Nah... you know what I think?
(Some people hate!) I think...
(I think they've lost their minds) Think y'all lost your mind
Y'all got me on my shit
Raw rough and rugged, when addressin the mass public
My attitude is fuck it cause motherfuckers love it
Got a, chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas
And fuck bein famous, I came to get the butters
I came from the gutter, my success in this game
Is sort of like ""Pro-jectic Justice,"" a payment for brushes
With police officers, a peace offering
From the Gods for the streets I was tossed in
Till I'm deceased in a coffin
I'ma be a beast on these beats, releasin early and often
Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon' change the numbers
It's the strengthenin of chain among us
Please, we ain't afraid of none of yas, who want it with us?
Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summers, c'mon
(Some people hate!) Jeah, uh, yeah
(Some people hate!) Uh, uh, uh
(Some people hate!) Yeah... you know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) They say success breeds envy
I guess it's just the penalty of leadership
I guess I'm what niggaz wanna be and shit
Or niggaz just bored, wanna be in shit
'Fore they get to rappin', start believin it
Think they Ali and shit
I roll with the punches so I survive
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise surprise
They try to take me out the game, but I's alive
It's like a old negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga
You bastards know me, the one and only
Big homey from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely
You need Jesus in your life... it's either that
Or y'all gon' make me put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga!
(Some people hate!) I know niggaz are hatin' man, let me find out
(Some people hate!)
Jealousy's a weak emotion, y'all gotta overcome that man
(Some people kill their brothers)
C'mon man be stronger than that... you know what I think?
(I think they've lost their minds) You'll be aight though
Au contraire nigga, I am here 'cause I earned the shit
By ridin' out, when niggaz had learner's permit
We bring the knives out, or we let them burners spit
I bring them pies out if niggaz wanna burn the strip
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out, turn your 6
I laid back in the Maybach
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggaz from way back
Niggaz wanna clown but the pound it don't play dat
Get yourself found, drowned, where the lake at
Run up on 'em +Notoriously+, ""Take that!"" (take that)
And then we comin' where your wake at
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that

And I don't turn them away, I'm like - bring them on
Now - where's her man is not my concern
It's not what I'm worried about, I'm just tryin' to hurry her out
Clear her whole area out
And bring this whole party little nearer to my house
Now - where's her spouse? I don't know

I - like her wit, I'm lovin' her shoes
I'm a alternative rap, I'm playin' the blues
I'm a thorough street nigga never breakin the rules

Good dudes - I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga got move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin' 4 Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
Well somewhere in a small town, somewhere lockin a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick
On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me and My Bitch""
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand sayin', ""Let me see that clip""
Shoppin' sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see - that's it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fuzzy and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you...
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just f***in them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you CAN turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's goin' bad, she's gone forever...
I mourn forever
Shit I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever

Over my right shoulder I told you to wipe your eyes
Take your time when you likin a guy
'Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, it's pimp or die
I bought you earrings on your birthday
Drove you to college your first day

Shit we grew apart, try to blame it on your new spouse
I know it hurt like hell the day you kicked me out

And who wants to be the mother of a son who sold drugs
Co-workers saw me on the corner slingin Larry Love
Meanwhile, you workin hard like, two or three jobs

Hold up, wait a minute, stop
Jigga, I'm about to put the shit down
Hold up, wait a minute, stop
I'm about to, make these niggaz get down
Hold up, wait a minute, stop
Guaranteed, these niggaz gonna feel us
Hold up, wait a minute, stop
Tone and Poke, blow the motherfuckin' speakers
(R. Kelly)
Grab a bottle, get two models
Thugs at Apollo's, niggaz wanna follow
I'm about to show you, how wild it gets
That nigga Hov', is the craziest
Stop at the club, 'bout a quarter to six
With a bottle in my hand, yellin' ""Bitch, I'm rich""
Hey, y'all niggaz see me, I can't believe it
You startin' to sound like, you don't want it
Tony's on the drop, blue and yellow rocks
He keep yellin', stop, Sisqo's album flopped
What you wanna do, if you drinkin', I'm hangin' out with you
Five, four, three, two, one
Hang on y'all, let's have some fun
(Jay-Z)
It's Young... uh, mack alone, I'm back in the zone
I'm out they way, still these rappers won't leave me alone
I can give a fuck what these rappers sayin' 'bout me
That just let's me know, they can't go a day without me
Scared of me succeading, that's the reason you doubt me
'Cause if you ain't believe me, you wouldn't be thinkin' 'bout me
Sorta how like you, never crossed my mind
Until you crossed the line, stop...
Then I gotta come across a rhyme
To let the world know you come across a mime
I do so much sauce with lines, with someone who saws my climb
From Marcy to party, where you soakin' up blue nine
Prude, am I, got a du-lema, I'm a dude from the hood
Who loves jewels, who am I?
You where placed in the same shoes, size 10/5
With a sick view, of the place you grew, dude, can I
Live, what I did, for this whole rap circus
I open up more doors for y'all fuckers than car service
Y'all nervous, I ain't back yet
I'm on extended vaca', I ain't unpack yet, stop worrying
(R. Kelly)
Five, four, three, two, one
Hang on y'all, let's have some fun
(Foxy Brown)
Shit, she back with the nigga inf dot
Uh-oh, somebody better tell this broad
I'm a nine year veteran, I'm back with my breathren
I sware to god, it feel like '96 again
Bitches snatchin' bags, see, they fuckin' with my shit again
We bout to let them hammers pop
In the 'Stuy, dudes, callin', you a problem, Fox'
I got the automore pierre watch
Butterscotch, GT, good toe on, three eight cock
Y'all ain't see this much love since they cried for 'Pac
Since Big passed, or since Jay passed the Roc
I'm in a clearport, full length mink in a G4
Fuck I'm lookin' like rhyming for a hundred g's, for?
No, I don't talk to media guys
I don't chatter with the best, ain't no question whose the best
Shawn and Kelly, Fox, best of both worlds, I see y'all
Aiyo, Kel, nigga, holler at your peoples

Is he a Blood, is he Crip?
Is he that, is he this?
Did he do it? Y'know, eh
Look...
If I shoot you, I'm brainless
Different toilet, same shit, and I'm sick of explainin this
I'm waitin on arraignment, my nigga is the plaintiff
Yeah, I know what you thinkin' - fucked up ain't it?
I shoulda known better, and I planned to
But dog they be takin' me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle
I sat back and watched it, put the gats back in the closet
I tried to tie my hands like an Iraqi hostage
Let niggaz take shots at me, no response
I just - flip and, pop my collar like the Fonz
You give a nigga a foot he'll take you one step beyond
He'll try to play you twice, the third time is the charm
You wanna conversate with the writer of the Qu'ran
Or Old Testament, don't test him then
I know what y'all thinkin' dick, pause
Your future's my past, I've been here before
I know when you're schemin, I feel when you plottin
I got, mental vision, intuition
I know where you goin' I read your mind's navigational system
Everybody whisperin - pst pst pst ss perspirin
When the, streets is talkin', niggaz is gossipin
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?
I need to know... geah geah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah...
(Jay-Z)
You see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin
And I only use his waist to keep my glock in
But when shit goes down you know who's doin' the poppin'
And if you don't know, guess who's doin' the droppin'
S dot again, y'all got him in a bad mood
Bad move; that's bad news
How many times have I got to prove?
How many loved ones have you got to lose
Before you realize that it's probably true?
Whatever Jigga say, Jigga probably do
Shit I paid my dues, I made the news
I came in the door for dolo, blazed the crews
And the streets say Jigga can't go back home
You know when I heard that? When I was back home
I'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome
On any Martin Luther, don't part with your future
Don't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya
The answer is simply too dark for the user
And as a snot-nose they said that he got flows
But will he be able to drop those before the cops close in?
'Fore the shots froze him, and he's dead and gone
From what the block has spoken, my God
Everybody stressin, who's his baby's moms?
Who he got pregnant, let me tell you, ah...
When the, streets is talkin', niggaz is gossipin
Bitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?
I need to know... chicka-uh-ah, ah-chk-ah-uh-ah
Chicka-ch-ah, chk-ah-ah-ah

I need to know... gi-gi-gi, geah yeah uh, yeah yeah uh
Yeah, yo, yo
(Jay-Z)
I seen my first murder in the hall, if you must know
I lost my pops when I was eleven mmm twelve years old
He's probably somewhere where the liquor is takin' it's toll
But I ain't mad at you dad, holla at your lad
I grew up pushin snowflake to niggaz that was pro-base
The stress'll take a young nigga, give him a old face
All I did was smoke joke, think and drink
Copped 'caine and complained, front row watch game
I seen niggaz before me, with a chance to write they own script
Slip up and change the story
I seen young niggaz go out in a blaze of glory
Before reachin' puberty, scared a nigga truthfully
I took trips with so much shit in the whip
That if the cops pulled us over the dog'd get sick, SNIFF
Smell me nigga? The real me nigga, minus the rumors
Holla if you feel me nigga
(Beanie Sigel)
The streets is not only watchin but they talkin' now?
Shit they got me circlin the block before I'm parkin now
Don't get it twisted, I ain't bitchin, I'm just cautious now
So, under the park the extra cartridge now
Hit his click Sig' up you fell at it you're dense
I get word to the street like Bell Atlantic express
I feel the vibes and I hear the rumors
But fuck it, I'm still alive and I'm still ?? ?? Allah
Niggaz wanna press me, put my back to the wall
But pressure bust pipes I know, I spat it to y'all
To know me is to love me, you see me, can't be me, hate this
Fuck you I got guns like Neo in +Matrix+
Cross the Family, think Mac's sweet like payroll
Or soft like Play-Doh get knocked off like Fredo
Corleone, they find you with a hole in your dome
I roll with niggaz that'll follow you and go to your home
Thought you ball, but nigga you fall to my defense
Catch you while you reachin', clip you then I cross you then I'm leavin'
Apply full court pressure
Like four-four ?? get you out of here, pull pressure
To the trigger, bullets fly in three's
You forever rest under bullshit, dirt lies and leaves
I do bullshit, dirt, tell lies then leave
Look in my eyes, realize it's Beans
Niggaz wanna despise the team; till I play head coach
And straight up, divide they team
Trade they man for some pies and a couple of things
Till the bullet... ah, motherfuckers! Yeah..."
203,Streets Is Watching,1997,"In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997)",East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
But if you shoot me, then you're famous -- what's a nigga to do?
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted
But my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it
Beef is sorted like Godiva, chocolates
Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it
Plan aborted, you and your man's get a pass
This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time
Y'all n*ggaz ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas
Tryin' to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John McNale
The type to start a beef then, run to the cops
When I see you in the street got, one in the drop
When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
Or taking pictures with some bitches, in front of the drop
The streets is watching
When the, streets is watching
Blocks keep clocking
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
Can't ignore it
Man, it's hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill
The streets is watching you, when you froze your arms
Niggas wanna test you and your gun goes warm
Can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up
Sweet niggas running 'round swearing shit is sweeter
Once you're tagged lame the game is follow the leader
Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer
Kidnap niggas wanna steal ya
Broke niggas want no cash, they just wanna kill ya
For the name, niggas don't know the rules
Disrespectin the game, want you to blow your cool
Force your hand, of course that man's plottin
Smarten up, the streets is watching, it's on
My street mentality flip bricks forever, know me and money
We like armed co-defendants, nigga we stick together
Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
Hustle harder to see if indictment time came around
Now you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found
Put in twenty-four hour shifts but, niggas mouths got slow leaks
Had to hide between my workers, couldn't play those streets
Stay outta space like Mercury you jerkin me? Hectic
Had to call upon my wolves to send, niggas the message
I said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here
I'm trying to transform you Boyz II Men like daycare'
Hey there's money to be made and, niggas got the picture
Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer
Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff
Had warrants, the other half, in the casket lay dormant
I felt like life was cheating me, for the first time
In my life I was getting money but it was like my conscience was eating me
Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that?
I'm playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back
Like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mindframe bad
Was niggas was thinkin' simplify was turnin' cocaine crack
Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack
And not collide like two trains that's on the same track
'Fore I get my life together like the oars I bring back
In the bottom of the pot where no, water gets hot
Got my transporter take it 'cross the border then stop
Set up shop with a quarter of rock, here's the plan
For three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block
But you know the game is 'lluted, that fucked up me and my dues
One drop can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops
And this unstable way of living just, had to stop
Half of my niggas got time, we done real things
By ninety-four became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes
Public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my shit
But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in the shit
The life and times of a nigga mind, excited with crime
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
I figured, 'Shit why risk myself I just write it in rhymes
And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine'
The mindstate, of a nigga who boosted the crime rate
So high in one city they send National Guards to get me"

What are you going to do now?
How are you gonna kill it?
You gonna become unsuccessful?
Frank, you can be successful and have enemies
Or;
Be unsuccessful too and you can have friends
I got these niggas breezy, don't worry about it.
Let that bitch breath,
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less.
What do I think of success
It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick, cause friends I grew up with
See me as a pre-me but I'm not and my nuts big
I don' know what the fuss is
My cribs illustrous
My rep is impeccable
I'm not to be fucked with
Shit
Let that bitch breath...
I'm way to important to be talking about extortin'
Asking me for a portion is like asking for a coffin
Broad day light I off your on switch
Ya not too bright, goodnight, long kiss
Bye, bye my reply
Bla bla
Blast burnin and pass burnin the ta ta
Finish my breakfast, why?
I got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry
Now where was i?
Let that bitch breathe
I used to give a shit, now I don give a shit more
Truth be told, I had more fun when I was piss poor
I'm pissed off
This what success all about?
A bunch of niggaz actin' like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple cars I don bring half them shits out"

And still there's pain
If I would have grew up to be a doctor, my nephew would have grew up to do the same
But since I grew up through the game, and my influence is the same
And my therapy is music, they ask if you ashamed
And though I wish I could separate, two things,
I cannot, so my answer to you remains
I can walk down the hall or mirrors, in versailles
And be so satisfied when I look a myself in the eyes
No shame, no sir, just big boats and tearing the coast up
Tight coup like I'm wearing the roadster,
For any coup I'm bear hugging the holster.
Hov, all right, all right
And that may not be
What you call perfect
But, but it's my life
The life, the life, the life
Once again it's the life
So I make no apologies
Crooked policies
So a g a nigga gotta be
We playing for property, no monopoly
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me
They say the child shall lead,
So I take it far as I can, and then we shall see
Shall we dance with the devil, for a beat
I pray to god I ain't got two left feet
Do the hustle, put keys in the street
Then I'm ballroom dancing, ke-ke'ing in the suite
Sweet.
Bb's on the feet, TV's in the seat
Enemies on the creep
It's so corrupt
Soak it up
It's a lesson, never fuck up
One day you're up, next day you're down
Long as you stay the same, it will come back around
I'm even better, I'm eating better
Best thing about it is, my niggas eating together
With each endeavor
We reaching levels, niggas ain't seen in like forever
I'm hyman roth I make all my partners rich
I can vouch for you, if you ain't a part of this
So pardon me as I pave my wrist
As I parlay my chips, hov!
All right, all right, American gangster, gangster, business like I'm white
But I'm not, I'm just bright
So fly with no fear of the flight
So if y'all hear my plight
And if you think you can make it this far without a fight
Couple mistakes here and there, not always right
But I'm always real, that's how I sleep at night"

You can't tie a sweater over that ass, it hotter than pajamas

DVD, she make it hard to watch a flat TV - Whoa
I crept up behind her
Mami threw it like a quarterback, I caught that like Rice
I call mami Montana, bandana
Tied her hands up - this is gangsta love
Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked
This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude
Poured a glass of Army, got mami in the mood
Then she stripped for me like the ""Moulin Rouge""
I think I might wife her
Y'know, powder blue Roc-a-Wear suit, white Nike her
Add mami to the cypher

For you to ever sweat the next bitch - with speed
I make the next bitch see the exit - indeed
Gotta know you're ver-ily respected - by me

You get your own 2002, she through ridin'
Keep yo' ass tighter than Versace
That's why you gotta watch yo' friends
You gotta watch me, they connivin shit
See I just wanna freak your body-adi-adi
I know you don't do this for everybody-adi
But everybody ain't as horny as me
And your body's - callin, me...

Uh, yeah
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans
Y'all know the first date wearers
To make objects bigger than they appear like a rearview mirror
Oh her shoe game is real
She gave 'em the Christian Libountins (?) with the four inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear
Is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?

Beautiful women sippin' throught rouge lips

You can lay in your casket just as you is
We appreciate the target practices
We'll be sure to send flower baskets kid

But they did it to themselves
I was gon' do it with the flow
But they did it with their sales
I was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help
And they did a good job them boys is talented as hell
'Cause not only did they brick they put a building up as well
They ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar then took a smell
'Cause they heard that second hand smoke kills
Niggas thought they was ill found out they was... ILL
And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel

In the memory of those that we lost, it's deicated
We miss y'all, uh-huh, yeah-hea
(Jay-Z + (R. Kelly))
This right here this whole album's...
In the memory of all our fallen soldiers (uh-huh)

We mastered this, don't you know
I eat beef and breathe acid, weak bastards
We copped and we crash it
Then we cop again 'cause we are classic
Let me speak for ya R we ""Scarface"" re-enacted
""The Godfather"" trilogy re-casted
But it's real like we grievin for Aaliyah with the masses
But I hope my boy Dash get to see it when he passes
I feel her soul when the Lee passes
When the wind blows, it's almost like I see her in the Hamptons
Even more reason to be up in them mansions
Laid back, feet up in the hammock, I'ma live for ya
Big too, till they put me in the grave
I'ma floss till they toss me a Bed-Stuy parade
Till Chi-Town make a nigga Mayor for a day
In the memory of Joanne Kelly, let us pray

Yes, just point out the bounce nigga
Yo, listen

Rumor has it ""The Blueprint"" classic
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevero
Now it's a whole museum of, Hov' MCers
Everybody dupin the flow, you see 'em
Everybody loopin up soul
It's like you tryin' to make ""The Blueprint 2"" before Hov'
Shout out to Just Bleezy and, Kan-yeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like - oh shit, he's so handsome
Still in demand in the longest run standin
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin' to Canton, I'm now eligible
Point out the bounce - and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts till it's hard to count
Point out the bounce - I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole key to the R.O.C.
Point out the bounce - Timbo the king nigga
Uh, yeah, uh
Point out the bounce - jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga
Uh, I got y'all...
(Jay-Z)
For those that think Hov' fingers bling bling'n
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is, and singled that out
To be the meaning of what he is about
And bein I'm about my business, not minglin much
Runnin' my mouth, that shit kept lingerin
But no dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinklin
The album width to keep the registers ringin'
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Jeah, you jinglin baby
See I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot, but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slangin them O's like a real O.G. should
Oh, he's good, no he would never sell out he's so young
Point out the bounce - and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts till it's hard to count
Point out the bounce - I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole key to the R.O.C.
Point out the bounce - Timbo the king nigga
Uh, yeah, uh
Point out the bounce - jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga
(Kanye West)
Magazines call me a rock star, girls call me cock star
Billboard, pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-Town go-gettin' pimps, we mobsters
Gingerbread Man even said, ""You're a monster!""
Yeah, that's how I feel
To be down, you must appeal
To the crew, we're rated R
O.C., O.G., Bobby Johnson son
Ask me, ""Rey-Rey, is that yo' car?""
I seen MTV, I know who you are
You did ""Takeover,"" do you got beef with Nas?
I did take over the game, brought back the soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum to go, yeah that's the flow
All I, know, I gots the flow
And I don't play 'cause I'm from Chicago
Point out the bounce - and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts till it's hard to count
Point out the bounce - I turn a 8 to an ounce
To a whole key to the R.O.C.
Point out the bounce - Timbo the king nigga
Uh, yeah, uh
Point out the bounce - jeah, Young Hov' the king nigga

211,The City is Mine,1997,"In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997)",East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Chorus: Blackstreet
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
In the middle of darkness
He's a man of the night
Verse One: Jay-Z
What the deal playboy just rest your soul
I be holding it down yo still love the dough
Got these ladies on the cock now you know how we go
Got the whole world on lock now you know how we flow
Don't worry about Brooklyn I continue the flame
A whole world with amnesia won't forget your name
You held it down long enough
Let me take those reigns
And just like your spirit the commission remains
Niggas can cross the T's and dots the I's
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
I'm taking this rap shit serious to my demise
Jay shits like cake mix watch me rise
Bay 6 in the basement waste it
Asking my dogs for advice and when he can't say shit
My hatred is for you just give me a sign
And I let the world know that the city is mine
Verse Two: Jay-Z
Y'all want to know how I flow just seek and you fine
I'm like a brain in a voicebox I speak my mind
About to redefine rap mommy, either I'm
The illest nigga doing it or these niggas is losing it
I read an article that said I was growing and shit
But every time I look, I'm moving units in quick
So I'm going to hit y'all with these last two and split
And leave niggas with nothing but my influences
*** I ain't mad go ahead bite my shit
Sell half of what I sell but that's not quite my shit
I'm the type to buy a rollie and just ice my shit
On the spot fuck coming back twice and shit
I realize that my floss game still intact
A horse game you lame dudes can't feel that
Like the first dude to cop the 850 in 89
And drove it up to 55th, the city is mine
Verse Three: Jay-Z
I snatch your girl 'cause your arm ain't strong enough
Plus y'all don't stay in the studio long enough
I make hits while y'all stay hating and take bricks
Had it locked till I came in the club
Take 6 had your chick 'cause you swore she was innocent
Got her a Chinese manicure hair done by Dominicans
All for what
So I could be in a dark corner
All in her butt at the bar alchoholing her up
I represent the lifestyle of niggas who thirst cream
Buck 50 a shot louie VIII
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella, yo know the name
I ain't a player, get it right I'm controlling the game
From now until they blow holes in my frame
I'm going to stand firm, holding my aim, feel that?
I'm the focal point like Biggie in his prime
On the low though - Shhhhh!
The city is mine
You belong
You belong
In the middle of darkness
He's a man of the night"
212,The Prelude,2006,Kingdom Come (2006),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"You know, you've got this fantasy in your head about
Gettin' outta the life and settin' the corporate world on it's ear.
What the fuck you gonna do except hustle?
Besides pimpin' you really ain't got the stomach for that.
The game's fucked-up
Niggas beats is banging
Nigga ya hooks did it
Ya lyrics didn't
Ya gangsta look did it
So I would write it if y'all could get it
Being intricate'll get ya wood critics
On the internet
They like you should spit it, I'm like you should buy it
Nigga that's good business
Forget this rap shit I need a new hustle
A little bit of everything, a new improved russell
I say that reluctantly 'cause I do struggle
As you see I can't leave so I do love you
But I'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper
In fact you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper
Back when crack was what these pills are
I was a real star complete with real cars
No video ones, you can and come set up a camera
Let the video run
In my real life complete with real ice
VVS boulders all invisibly set
Head and shoulders my invisible neck
You see hova wasn't digital yet
B4 steve jobs made the ipod
Was gettin' head jobs, we call that intimate
Back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette
With an automatic weapon I was rappin' with a tek
Fresh like manny b changed like antifreeze
Shoe box full of cash
Dealer man hand me keys
Pantries full of arm 'n' hammer
Don't take nancy drew to see what it do
Ima damn g
Just sent a million dollars through a handsfree
That's big money talk can you answer me?
Before the Answer was a 3 I was down in gerogetown with a hoya chick, loya chick
Sure hes rich now 'cause he saw this shit, all this shit
That's why they call him hov 'cause he came before all this shit
Bought a 6, quarter 7 skipped on them quarter 8s
Bought a 9 for nonstop glockwork all the time
Guess whos back
Since this is a New Era got a fresh new hat
10 your veteran
I been said I been through with this bullshit game
But I never can
I used to think rappin' at 38 was ill
When last year alone I grossed about 38 mill
I know I ain't quite 38 but still
The flow so Special got a .38 feel
The real is back"

Well once upon a time, they left the glove and the star, kid
He swore he was the man, but he was nothing but garbage
Let me rephrase that, bubblin' with pride
Did have skills, but he was ugly inside
Instead of uplift folks, sittin' on the non sense
Hurtin' people feelings like he didn't have a conscience
Like 'I love you', when he's hittin' that stash
Then degraded, the shorty, like he didn't have class
Even let a gay jew man tack his jheri
Then, got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy
Swindlin', forgot the god above him
Finally, fan base trinklin' down to nothing
No concern for his estate, though, was yearnin' for a break
Bitter and evil, didn't learn from his mistake
The moral of the story is, don't be a pair of knickers
Be good, boys and girls, and you can be as great as
Rick is
(R. Kelly w/ Doug E. Fresh beatboxing)

I'm lyin' next to fiends now, that's the end of the story
Let me bring y'all niggaz back to the very first scene now
December 4th, a child is born
Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on
That's how we do it when the man of the house is gone
You either, stand or fall, I chose to stand
The hawk outside, so I blow my hand
It's a cold cold world but I overstand
Tryin' to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn
Can't cope with bein broke, I'm a man - c'mon
(Chorus: R. Kelly)
Son don't let these streets, get the best of you
I will be right by your side, when you goin' through
Son just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
Just don't let it (just don't let it)
... Get the best of you
(R. Kelly)
Late one night I was, rollin' the streets
Just, thinkin' about what's goin' on with me and
Trapped in this thug life, tryin' to break free but
This thug life just keeps callin me
I'm livin' life way too dangerously
I'm drownin in my misery
Looked in the mirror, there's my enemy
Cause poppa never was a part of me
Take one step at a time, mama said
Sweet memories still remain in my head
All of my life been lied to, misled
Voices be like, ""Don't you wish you was dead?""
No ground to place my feet
I feel the fire under me
A way out is all I need
Somebody, answer me!
(Chorus + ad libs)
(Jay-Z)
Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free
... Cause ain't no goin' home for me
It's a cold cold world but I blew my hand
A true first 'cause I knew that man
I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first
And I couldn't stand the thought of my momma steppin foot inside a church
All I try to do is try to get up out the dirt
Guess he's tryin' to do the same, told me get up out his turf
I wanted to talk to him, but that shit'd never work
We was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his
Momma's rent, his young brother's clothes
My nephew's food, and with that I suppose
... And with that I froze
Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron folds
And this story is told, for young soldiers
Who never choose the life we chose
(Chorus + (ad libs))
(R. Kelly)
Tears in my eyes as I look up, I'm tryin' to
Hold back my pride but reality is screamin
Gotta get a job cause mo-mma also screamin
Streets are just like drugs, and it's like I'm out here fiendin
Forget all the hits in the industry, cause
Ain't no exceptions in this game for me, look
Neither God or my enemies, I
Choose God 'cause he understands, this
Young man with a thuggish heart
Whole world in his hands but still torn apart
Like I'm so close, but it's still so far
Nightmares of me in a swervin car, oh
No ground to place my feet (my feet)
I feel the fire under me (hey)
A way out is all I need (all I need)
Somebody, answer me!
(Chorus + ad libs)"

Jeah... uh... what shall I do for a livin' nigga
What shall I Eat for a livin' nigga {*watcher*}
That's how I live for a livin' nigga... {*watcher*}
Okay, let's do this {*the watcher*}
(Verse One: Jay-Z)
Things just ain't the same for gangsters
But I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters
All of these rap singers claimin they bangers
Doin' all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
Disrespectin the game, no home trainin or manners
I was doin' this shit when you was shittin Pampers
I was movin them grams 'fore you, knew what a hand-to-hand was
Duckin the vans, radars, the scanners
'Fore you knew what hard white to tame was
I was hittin the turnpike, aight with the bammers
I was nice with my hands, 'cause I fight with them hammers
I was prickin my finger 'fore you knew what a Fam was
I had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
Three hundred mill' later, now you understand us
Y'all ain't see us comin' through Vegas
You ever seen so much cham' bust in one night
Grand fucked up one fight
I was on the Peter Pan bus
You was Peter Pan up in your room, y'all fuckin' with whom?
Allow me to retort
You cowards is just now learnin the shit that we taught
You niggaz ain't know about a Robb Report
'Bout a high speed Porsche,
I.e., you niggaz ain't know how to floss
Till I came through the door
Like ""Eric B. for Pres,"" respect me in this BITCH!
You can't disrespect us cause you got a little check cut
You was suckin so long, fuckin' ya little neck up
Now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
You think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous
I blew breath on you midgets, I gave light to the game
It's only right I got the right to be king
Niggaz that got life really like what I sing
'Cause they know is he really like, niggaz feel my pain
Know the shit I DON'T write
Be the illest shit that's ever been recited
In the game word to the hyphen in my NAME!
J, A, Y, -, Hoffa
The past, present, nigga the future, proper
The holy trinity of hip-hop is us
We give, Dre his props BUT that's where it stops
It's the Roc
(Chorus: Truth Hurts)
I know, you got your eyes on me
I feel you watchin me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You bed-da off not lookin' at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as befo')
(People I used to know, just don't know me no mo')
(But everywhere that I go, I got people I know)
(Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)
(Verse Two: Dr. Dre)
I'm still on top of the game
Still droppin' flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had the Roc for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world chear for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played
The best to emerge in the game is The Watcher
(Chorus: Truth Hurts)
I know, you got your eyes on me
I feel you watchin me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You bed-da off not lookin' at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as befo')
(People I used to know, just don't know me no mo')
(But everywhere that I go, I got people I know)
(Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)
(Verse Three: Rakim)
I'm ""Rated R,"" my brain contains graphics thangs
It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends
It's like, watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
Take away the added profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try copin
I've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
I'm still alive and scopin
Be another hundred years till my skies close in
And I'ma die with my eyes open, the watcher {*echoes*}
(Chorus: Truth Hurts)
I know, you got your eyes on me
I feel you watchin me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You bed-da off not lookin' at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as befo')
(People I used to know, just don't know me no mo')
(But everywhere that I go, I got people I know)
(Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)"

Think there's been a murder-errra-ah-hah-ah
I ah, think there's been a...
I... I think there's been a...
(Jay-Z)
I hustle from, night to morning, dawn to dusk
Kidnap and robberies like, (c'mon nigga) ""You goin' with us""
I held roundtable meetings so we could go on and discuss
Not only money but all the emotions goin' through us
Why we don't cry when niggaz die, that's how the street raised him
Look in the air, say a prayer (hail mary) hopin God forgave him
Cop liquor, twist it, tap it twice, pour it to the pavement
We live dangerous, often findin ourself in the eyes of strangers
(Who the fuck is you?) My dream is big and in it my team is rich
As seen through the eyes of a nigga who ain't seen shit
Back to live action, I'm packin, I'm still in the mix
Like new hits, I think I'm goin' over your head a lil' bit
But I let you know I changed names when I roam through town
Stay free and be who I'm professional known as now
Jay-motherfuckin-Z; and with that said
Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and uh
(Jay-Z)
My infatuation with autos led to autos gettin' sprayed
Houses gettin' broken in, quarters gettin' trayed
Bricks gettin' chopped, mom's pots gettin' used
One thrown in that water, try the soda in there too
Expensive shoes worn, Louis Vuitton seat, roof gone
Coke cheap, my face is like a coupon
I gotta do Shawn, cause even when Jay-Z was lukewarm
I was gettin' my loot on, nigga I'm too strong
Eat till the food's gone, they placed me on this earth
The twin brother of rich/poor though, separated at birth
I got the soul of a hustler, quiet noise like a muffler
Fuck with us, walk through the ghetto, see the place that corrupted us
Learn why we buck at the guys that come up with us
Ain't enough bucks for us to split in this shit
Plus ain't nobody lovin' us; and with that said
Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and uh
(Jay-Z)
See my life is like a see-saw
And until I move this weight it's gon' keep me to the floor
Travel with me through my deep thoughts
Y'all can't learn Jigga by the shit y'all be readin in The Source;
It's deeper of course
Follow the life of this reckless minor
At sixteen in the 600, unlicensed driver
Playin', cops and robbers, like shots can't stop us
Flippin a bird to the choppers (fuck you coppers)
Buck-thirty on the turns
Reckless abandon, when I'm standin on this pedal
Hand on my metal, minus all this time they tryin' to give me
Lord help me, all I ever wanted to be was wealthy or
Somebody to tell me that they felt me
I tried to play the hand you dealt me
But you gave me five funnies an' shit
I was hungry I need menage money
Nothin' less than a 520; and with that said
Back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is *BLAM*

You know the flow sicka, know Jigga, mo' sicka now right
You know what me and Swizz's shit sound like
Crazed and demonic, uh without blazin' chronic
Product of Reaganomics
You know that motherfuckin stoop raised me
Ringin' in da hoops but I was too lazy
School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy
Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z
Let me explain this to you baby
I spent nights out, days in
Niggaz was blazing, twelve noon where I was raised in
I felt caged in but kept roaming
Prayed for the Day of Atonement
Married to the streets no date of annulment
It seems every time it comes up
They postpone it
So I kept my chrome at the waist
Waiting for the omen
Savoring the moment and now you know
The reason that I flow the way I flow baby

Bottled up like crack
That's how I make you bounce like that
Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that
That's why no other rapper got a sound like that
Trap, trap of my life
Flashback, kill niggaz
Rap skills unmatched, Jigga man baby
I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it
God given, gifts of a soul for hard living
Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom
Could've been lost in the system
Instead I'm involved with the rhythm
I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
I know I must be part of some mission
Shit I used take it for granted
Why they placed me on this planet
I would ask myself while writin raps to myself
But right there under my nose
Was the flow of all flows
Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on

Homes spazzed like a bad back

Don't matter to me the Garden or flowin on Clue
Whatever niggas wanna do - it's all right with me
Whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy
Dusty or musty, sober or saucy
Broker than Todd Bridges, richer than Bill Cosby
Forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty?
Past on to the next life and you still haunt me
I'mma keep doing me unfortunately

Make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son

Geah... whassup?
Where's all my street niggaz, project niggaz
Real niggaz, worldwide
Let's reflect... e'rybody got a story
We all ghetto B - here's mine
Geah
See I was -- born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit - I kept arms
38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs - arms through it; or stuffed with embalmin fluid
Shit, I'm goin' through it - mom dukes too
Tears streamin down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is gettin' too wild
I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it
Bout to lose it; voices screamin ""Don't do it!""
It's like '93, '94, 'bout the year
That Big and Mag dropped; and ""Illmatic"" rocked
Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doin' 'em, I'm still scratchin on the block
Like ""Damn; I'ma be a failure""
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug - paraphernalia
Cops courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Tryin' figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you sellin
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be -- soon
(Chorus: Jay-Z)
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

Chill dog
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinkin' damn; how my older sister gon' make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
I'm tired of tryin' to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggaz thinkin' what y'all readin in The Source is real
What my life like, you lookin' at the source, it's real
What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real
Passin judgment, you niggaz second-guessin Beans
Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Amin
Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an
I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine
Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
Make 'em feel feel hell on earth before Allah drop thee
I feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me
Till them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make Mac not act like Beans
Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin
My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave dog
Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave dog
I come back in the afterlife
Like fuck it I done touched hell twice; what's the meanin'?
(Scarface)
Yeah... uh...
Now as I walk into the studio, to do this with Jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, countin' our blessings cause Brad's two
Prayin' for young souls to laugh atlife through the stars
Lovin' your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurtin' for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losin lifel; but you can view it like this
God's got open hands homey, he in the midst... of good company
Who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be wit your son
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong
I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love
It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us

I put the gun to ya, I let it sing you a song
I let it hum to ya, the other one sing along
Now it's a duet, and you wet, when you check out
The technique from the 2 tecs and I don't need two lips
To blow this like a trumpet you dumb shit
This is a un-usual musical I conduc' it
You lookin' at the black Warren Buffett so all critics can duck sic
I don't care if you C. Delores Tuck-it
Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only rylin me up
For three years, they had me peein out of a cup
Now they bout to free me up, whatchu think I'm gon' be, what?
Rehabilitated, man I still feel hatred
I'm young black and rich so they wanna strip me naked, but
You never had me like Christina Aguiler-y
But catch me down the Westside, drivin' like Halle Berry
Or the FDR, in the seat of my car
Screamin out the sunroof death to y'all
You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars
I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head
The whole hood'll want ya, you startin to look like bread
I send them boys at ya, I ain't talkin' bout Feds

Change your face or the bullets change all that for you

They call me Threats, nigga I been makin' threats

When the singer Rob calls the police on me y'all niggaz ran out and copped the CD
See what I discovered is y'all snitch lovers I might speak, but I don't fuck with nobody
See What Doug, Jimmy & L.A. don't know, these youngins crossed the line with Hov, I'm letting it blow
Had the papers writing stories like: ""didn't they know, this what happen when they made that rapper CEO""
I know, its just a matter of time before the steady hate start to overflow then the leavey breaks
And my conscience go, you escape the rico, why throw everything away over ego?
You paper chasing, they paper hating, billionare Hov you on the pace to make it
Fuck that exclamation comma quotations I love drama period

Smelling like Petrone singing dirty rap songs, tip-toeing in the crib like 6 in the morn
Every day it's the same I said in blueprint that I'd never change its just a part of the game
Respect me I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec but expect me to bug its in my blood
But if my chick leave me she gonna leave me for something, she gone leave me 'cause Halie,
She ain't gonna leave me for nothing, picture me gettin' up with something sleazy
Something something so easy you could take out its beat like nothing something
Soon as you finish cuttin' you like leave me please, not me I need Angilina Jolize company,
So I ain't gonna make a move unless I got I got a plan b, that'll happen the day I have a baby by free,
Not to say that anything is wrong with free, just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me

You don't know... what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
Sure I do...
I'm from the streets where the
Hood could swallow a man, bullets'll follow are followin' me
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet
Where personalities clash and chorme meets chorme
The coke prices up and down like it's wall street homes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown
All over that brown brome, one slip you are now gone
Welcome to hell where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come you better return 'em
All scars we earn 'em, all cars we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin out the back of van
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit homes, homes is about it
Was clappin them flamers before I became famous
For playin' me y'all shall forever remain nameless
I am Hov'
Sure I do, I tell you the difference between me and them
They tryin' to get they ones, tryin' to get them M's
One million, two million, three miliion, four
In just five years, forty million more
You are now lookin' at the forty million boy
I'm rapin Def Jam till I'm the hundred million man
R., O., C.
You don't know... what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
That's where you're wrong
I came into this muthafucka a hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact, from grindin G-packs
Put this shit in motion ain't no rewindin me back
Could make 40 off a brick but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov' would sell clothes
Heh, not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them
Heh, I smartened up, opened the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin' at one smart black boy
Momma ain't raised no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth
Muthafucka - I... will... not... lose
You don't know... what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
Put somethin' on it
I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire at hell
I am a hustler baby, I'll sell water to a well
I was born to get cake, move on and switch states
Cop the coupe with the roof go on and switch plates
Was born to dictate, never follow orders
Dickface, get your shit straight, fucka this is Big Jay
I... hahahaha... hahaha
You don't know... what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
... Will, not, lose, ever... fucka!"

It's the M.O.P. (yes)

And mothafucka we comin', 100 miles and gunnin'
I'm still runnin' with cash that's robbed
From the era of exhale 80's and hats back stomp
(Same game) operation for this industry lockdown
We still tote hammers that go BLOCOWWW
Run up if you wanna, believe me dawg
These hammers with they owners, fuck ya G up
Have ya with blue 'jamas in a coma, and
Ya family now moan, look, 70 pounds gone
A little fuck, scribbled up with a hospital gown on
(We holdin' it down Holmes) Keep pushin' weak frail bastards
To get over, we prowl with slimmer re-shelled tactics
Jiminy frail bastards, your tracks need tune-ups
No limit, what the fuck, recordin' for Nick Junior?
(The game ain't changed) It just got harder
Plus we sponsored by laz' Dame Dash and Mr. S. Scott Carter
Brownsville (yep), we stomp in this bitch all day
Rock with my cock out, face the crowd and piss off stage

Uh, uh, uh, I'm from the G-side of thangs
Where we ride and bang, where the heat died of flame
That's how we got the name (warriors)
And better than ya bank, and someone should be tellin' 'em
The veterans have came, and we're better in the game
(You better make it rain) (27 grams) My man
It's better than cocaine, now everything will change
In this family we'll rule the world
And you haters can eat a dick up till you hiccup and hurl
A decade on the grind, nigga I paid mine
So it's my time to shine and for you can ride the pine
I won't sit back and rap like these dumb ass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young ass kids
(M.O.P.) The OG's repped and survived around this motherfucka

When it's crunch time, we do it our wi-zzay
For shizzle my nigga, learn to grip pistols and BK
[Jay-Z]:
Whoo
Turn my music high, high, high, higher
Mo' fire, more Roc-a-wear attire
Mo' money, mo' murder now that M.O.P.'s hired
Mo' murder for the Roc empire, y'all won't surface
Y'all nervous knowin' them guns on full service, ready to fire
One body, two body, three body, four
Young sittin' on paper, I'm above the law
Young shittin' on haters, I ain't fuckin' with y'all
For my Brownsville neighbors, how about some hardcore?
And it just get worser, every time I saw my signature in cursive
Just add another million to these verses
One million, two million, three million, four
And the money's really worthless, I'm pissing you off on purpose
My nephew's situated, and my mama's straight
So I'm ready for whatever drama should come our way
And you niggas rappin' to me, so your drama is fake
You dudes is noodles, I got more ziti to bake
You dudes is cake
I keep two biscuits on the waist
Razorblades under the tongue
I will eat ya face
Appetite for destruction, I am starvin' today
Got a money hungry lawyer that'll ea the case
And that's just food for thought
Don't let it go to waste
Nigga, bite the bullet until you stuffin' ya face
I done forgot more than you ever learned
What you don't know will make your home a permanent earn, nigga
Do you believe in me?
Oh, no
You don't know what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
Do you believe in me?

You don't know what you're doing, doing, doing, doing"

Shawty from the south, oh, I think she like me,

Screaming hit 'em up, I'm screaming who shot ya,

Yeah we both eating its better than brunch,
Shawty like Pepsi, me I'm da Coke Man,
Body like a coke bottle, I crush it like a Coke can,
Started at the window, then the bedroom wall,
The Ying to my Yang, I skeet skeet off,
I hits it from the back, Shawty like the front,
The Bonnie to my Clyde,
Both riding shotgun,
Both covered in gold like C3PO,
James and Florida Evans let the good times roll,
Thought Shawty was the truth, found out she was a cheater,
We were supposed to takeover, I caught her bumping Ether!
I thought shawty like Mike, found out she like Prince,
Thought she was Adrian, it's been Rocky ever since,
My dollars was down, she left me for some Euro's,
Took my whole flavour, I call her coke zero,
Co-MVP like Kobe and Shaq,
Left me for the Heat,
We were winning back to back,
Said I partied too much, shawty got fed up,
Shawty got Britney shaved her whole head up,
We used to make out, kissing each others face off,
Fell for the ponzi scheme, damn shawty just Made-off.

She ain't livin' for the moment homey shake that bitch
He that cool, he can't take you nowhere? Then leave that fool
Be that rude if he that cool
Save for what? Ball till your days is up
This place is fucked, all type of AIDS and such
How they make it where you afraid to fuck
They gave us drugs then turned around and investigated us
Life is short, then you on life support

Get a grip bitch, this how I get through life
I buy out the bar, spit Crist' through the mic
See Jigga in the 6 and all the shit you like

Brooklyn stand up
(Verse One)
There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood
Or this pop, this hot
Or this strong
With so many different flows
This ones for this song
The next one I'll switch up
This one will get bit up
These fucks
Too lazy to make up shit
They crazy
They don't... paint pictures
They just trace me
You know what
Soon they forget where they plucked
They whole style from
And try to reverse the outcome
I'm like... tough
I'm not a biter
I'm a writer
For myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse I'm only biggin up my brother
Biggin up my borough
I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough
Plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about
Bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the bar-rel's in your mouth
I'm in... New sneakers
Deuce seaters
Few Diva's
What more can I tell you
Let me spell it for you

Movin wet off the step
Purple Rain in the drought
Stuntin on hoes
Brushin off my shirt
But ain't nothin' on my clothes
'Cept my chain
My name
Young H-O
Pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol I make payroll
Benz paid for
Friends they roll
Private jets down the Turks and Caicos
Cris' case loads
I don't give a shit
Nigga one life to live I can't let a day go
By
Without me being fly
Fresh to death
Head to toe until the day I rest
And I don't wear jerseys I'm thirty plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans nigga button ups
S dots on my feet
Make my sight complete
What more can I say Guru play the beat, I'm livin'
We gonna let this ride into the hook
I'mma snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you?
Get my grown man on
Let's go

Now you know ass is willie
When they got you in a mag
For like half a billi
And your ass ain't Lilly

That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly
It's both
I don't mean to boast
But damn if I don't brag
Them crackers gonna act like I ain't on they ass
The Martha Stewart
That's far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student
Just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it
In fact I'm just previewin it
This ain't the show I'm just EQ'in it
One, Two and I won't stop abusin it
To groupie girls stop false accusin it
Back to the music
The Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem Houston
What up B
They can't shut up me
Shut down I
Not even P.E.
I'mma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly
What these streets did to me
So picture me
Lettin these clowns nit pick at me
And Paint me like a pickiny
I will literally
Kiss Tee-Tee in the forehead
Tell her please forgive me
Then squeeze into your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off
In fact
I got a joint to knock your points off
Young
Hova the God nigga blasphamy
I'm at the Trump International
Ask for me
I ain't never scared
I'm everywhere
You ain't never there
Nigga why would I ever care
Pound for pound I'm the best to ever come around here
Excluding nobody
Look what I embody
The soul of a hustler I really ran the street
A CEO's mind
That marketing plan was me
And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated, like say a, Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culutre
I supposed to be number one on everybody list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this man

Troubled man, dare I say, I am Mar with the flow

235,What We Talkin' About,2009,The Blueprint 3 (2009),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Blueprint trios
Yeah, yeah
What we talkin' 'bout real shit or we talkin' 'bout rhymes?
You talkin' 'bout millions or you talkin' 'bout mine
What we talkin' 'bout 'cause I ain't got time
For what people be talkin' 'bout all the time
What we talkin' 'bout fiction or we talkin' 'bout fact?
You talkin' 'bout fiction? Hold up, pardon my back
I'm talkin' 'bout life and all I hear is
Oh, yeah, he keeps talkin' 'bout crack
I ain't talkin' 'bout profit, I'm talkin' 'bout pain
I'm talkin' 'bout despair, I'm talkin' 'bout shame
I ain't talkin' 'bout gossip, I ain't talkin' 'bout Game
I ain't talkin' 'bout Jimmy, I ain't talkin' 'bout Dame
I'm talkin' 'bout real shit, them people playin'
What is you talkin' 'bout? I don't know what y'all sayin'
People keep talkin' 'bout, Hov take it back
I'm doin' better than before, why would I do that?
Ain't nothing cool 'bout carryin' a strap
'Bout worryin' your moms and buryin' your best cat
Talkin' 'bout revenge while carryin' his casket
All teary eyed 'bout to take it to a mattress
I'm talkin' 'bout music, I ain't talkin' 'bout rap
You talkin' 'bout who's hot, I ain't talkin' 'bout that
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
I don't run rap no more, I run the map
They talk, we live, we see what
They say, they say, they say
They talk, we did, who cares what
They say, they say, they say
Still they can't' focus on them, they be talkin' 'bout me
Talkin' 'bout what I wear, talkin' 'bout where I be
Check out my hair, these ain't curls, these is peas
Peasey head still get paid, I'm combin' through G's
Please, we ain't focused on naps
'Cause I don't run rap no more, I run the map
A small part of the reason the president is black
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack
Talkin' 'bout progress, I ain't lookin' back
You know I run track, try not to get lapped
People keep talkin' 'bout Hov left 'em flat
Try to rewrite history, let's talk about facts
Dame made millions even Jaz made some scraps
He could've made more but he didn't sign his contract
As far as street guys, we was dealin' crack
That's just how the game goes, I don't owe nobody jack
Grown men want me to sit 'em on my lap
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black
I repeat, you can't sit on my lap
I don't have a beard, now get off my sack
Scream at me
They talk, we live, we see what
They say, they say, they say
They talk, we did, who cares what
They say, they say, they say
And now that that's that, let's talk about the future
We have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther
Now you could choose ta, sit in front of your computa
Posin' with guns, shootin' YouTube up
Or you could come with me to the White House
Get your suit up, you stuck on being hardcore
I chuck the deuce up, peace out Medusa
Welcome to the Blue ah Print ah tre piece, Jay-Z your tutor
Toota of my own horn, beep, beep, move ya
Ras clot when rude boy come through with the roof up
So I could see the sky
'Cause everybody talkin', Hov, I think we know why
They talk, we live, we see what
They say, they say, they say
They talk, we did, who cares what
They say, they say, they say"
236,When the Money Goes,2009,The Blueprint 3 (2009),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days, hey, hey, hey
When the top back, I know I got that
But when I'm locked up
Guru, let me get that again
When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey, hey, hey, I got it now
When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey, hey, hey, I got it now
When my top back, I know I got that
But when I'm locked up and I'm not back
And I collect call, will she accept that?
Will she stay down, through my setbacks?
Through my downfalls and my downpours
When them F-B-I boys is coming down for us
I know you riding with a nigga through the Gucci store
All through Prada but what if I had nada?
Would the babe even bother if the block got hotter?
In the never ending game that puts the cops versus robbers?
Am I in clouds or are you just along for the ride?
When I'm blasting out the window, will you grab the wheel and drive?
When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days, hey, hey, hey
When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days, hey, hey, hey
When I fall off and the drought hits
And it knocks me out new outfits
And the charm, you got gotta hit the pawn shop
And you feel like crying but be strong and stop
It was all good just a week ago
Now I'm wearing the same clothes a week in a row
Trying to scratch back
Would she take a little check from her little job like
""Nigga, you can have that""
You had belief in me or would you beef with me?
Is the good life the only thing you needed from me?
Would she roll out? Is she so out when the stoves out?
Or will she hold out?
When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days, hey, hey, hey
When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days, hey, hey, hey
And your friends know what Hov get it in for
But let's just say that I didn't ride Benzo
Would you say, ""Girl, why you still with him for?""
""And if so, babe, why you around them hoes?""
All they see is paper, not potential
And they don't have a nigga's back when he's in limbo
And I ain't asking you to do a life bid with me
I don't want you to die for me, baby, live with me
I'm just saying, when the going gets rough
Don't forget all the shines at the time I was showing up
Show me the same love you showed me when blowing up
You told me it was Roc for life, then throw it up
When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days, hey, hey, hey
When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days, hey, hey, hey"

Damn how am I gonna say this shit?
Hey... hey dad, yeah it's your boy
Remember me? I wanna talk to you scrap
I remember being kicked out the house
'Cause I looked just like you
Said I'd be nothing but a crook
Just like you
The niggaz in the hood was shook
Where the just like you
'Cause all they said was little whitey look
I'm just like you
But dog I can't see it at all, shit
We never kicked it at all
We never pitched or kicked at a ball
Dog, you never taught me shit
How to fight, ride a bike, fix a flat
None of that sorts of shit
Nigga you was an abusive pops
Fuck you left me out to dry, stuck
Gotta teach news to box
Gotta teach news to bop
And that ain't the half of it man
I gotta teach news to block
It's about time we have a father to son (nigga sit down)
Sit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons
How they grew to be men and father they sons
Father they daughters
Nigga, you left a fatherless daughter
I never follow your orders
Nigga you make me sick
Pussy you could... ooh
How you gonna leave these memories in the back of my mind
I can see it clear as day you smackin my mom
I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9
Put it in my palm when I was young
And said that would be mine, you turned me out
The reason why I hit the block
Reason why I tried to hit them cops
Reason why I started hittin shots
Reason why I started gettin' licked
And drinkin' syrup and skippin court
Ginger bread man never think of gettin' caught
Look at your hand man damn you fought
Nigga you left my mom
Left us with no good-bye's
You left us out to dry
You left us with no letters, notes, (nothing!) no replies
No digits numbers was unlisted
You left us with some of my loneliest night
Nigga some of my hungriest nights
Shit, one of the reasons for years (shit embarrasin)
Damn we used to think money was white
Yeah you gave us life like, fruit from a plant
We ain't eat right from them foods from them stamps
And to think you was my pop,
Man I gotta stop shit
Female: Daddy, Where Have You Been?
Beanie: And when you come home, you got us here all alone
Female: Mommy, Where Daddy Went?
Beanie: You always stick up for him
Always said you'd make up for him
Female: Mommy, What Happened Then?
Beanie: What was you cheatin' on him?
Why he's always beatin' on you?
Female: Daddy, Where Have You Been?
Beanie: Nigga, you gonna hear me out
(Jay-Z)
I wanted to walk just like him (remember?)
Wanted to talk just like him (word)
Often momma said I look too much
And I thought just like him (it could happen)
Wanted to drink Miller nips
And smoke Newports just like you
But you left me, now I'm goin' to court just like you
I would say ""my daddy loves me and he'll never go away""
Bullshit, do you even remember December's my birthday?
Do you even remember the tender boy
You turned into a cold young man
With one goal and one plan
Get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one
Always short with the income
Always late with the rent
You said that you was comin' through
I would stay in the hallway (waitin)
Always playin' the bench (waitin)
And that day came and went
Fuck You! very much you showed me the worst kind of pain
But I'm stronger and trust me I will never hurt again
Will never ask mommy ""why daddy don't love me?
Why is we so poor?, why is life so ugly?
Mommy why is your eyes puffy?""
Please don't cry everything'll be all right
I know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light
It's us against the world
We don't need him, right? (right)
Mommy drivin' 6's now (yeah), I got riches now (yeah)
I bought I nice home for both of my sisters now
We doin' real good
We don't miss you now
See how life twists around, fucker?"
238,Where I'm From,1997,"In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997)",East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Verse One:
I'm from where the hammers rung, News cameras never come
You and your man HUNG IN every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I GAVE straight bets
So I'M FELT I'M OWED SOMETHING, AND you nothing, check
I'M from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much
So they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, Summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your WORD was everything, So everything you said you'd do
You did it, Couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it
I'm from where niggas pull your CARD, and argue all day about
Who's the best MC's: Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs ARE AT ODDS
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy, son. Just thought I'd remind y'all
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy, son/ Ain't nothing nice
I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas is praying to god so long that they atheist
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow
Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday
I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale
You're laughing, you know the place well
Where the liquor stores and the base DWELL
And Government, fuck Government, niggas POLITIC themselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteen
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, god strike me
And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me?
We'll never know
One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, I'D LET EM KNOW,
MISTAKES and exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street
From where the pimps, prostitutes, and the drug lords meet
We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off LEEK
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether you'RE four feet or MANUTE-SIZE, it always starts out with
Three dice and shoot the five
Niggas thought they douce was live, UNTIL I hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas will show you love, That's how they fool thugs
Before you know it you'RE lying in a pool of blood"

We takin' trips abroad with chicks from afar
Down in the grill in the Villa gettin' hilla
Never know 'em at the resort, readin to ride with us all
Checkin' out this new wine, inhalin the cork
Million miles from the puddles the rainy days the tussles
Reign in ways to hustle, so we won't get caught
Had beef of all sort but I turned it around
Chose my steps more wisely, I'm learnin the ground
I was so gung-ho when I earned my first pound
Now it's million dollar deals, straight turnin' 'em down
Roc-a-Fella make or break me, till death do us
Won't be in your right mind, you ever step to us
Been there, when I was in my tenth year, went there
Then I realized that it didn't make sense there
Backtrack, show me where the cash at, and plus
Frivilous beef, please, we lookin' past that
Y'all can gossip while we learnin the world
Drop the hot shit never returnin your girl, it's on

Talking: Throughout my life (uh huh uh huh uh)
No matter what I've done.(Right)
You've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah)
Through all things (ye yeah) For that
I am eternally grateful.
Since my date of birth
Bought you nothing but hurt
Play those video games
Stole change from ya purse
Sat on the cold court bench
Till I was arraigned in ya skirt
Saw the pain in ya face
Through you maintained a smirk
All you did was motivate me
Don't let 'em hold you back
What I do I turned around
And I sold you crack
I was a bastard for that
Still I'm drowning in shame
Just remember one thing now
You're not to blame
You was newly separated
Tryin' to escape ya world
And through my thirst
I didn't help you
I just made things worse
I hated me and everybody
That created crack
Had me thinkin'
The newest kicks and the latest gat
Still haven't apologized
So please play this back
While I try to come to terms
With such a heinous act
You know in more than one way
Cocaine numbs the brain
All I did was think about
How the funds once came
Then I ran across this memory
And it stung the brain
How can you ever destroy the beauty
From which one came
That's a savage you're the reason
Why me and these beats make a marriage
Why I rhyme above average and
I ain't shit
Glad you got yourself together
No thanks to me
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
You must love me
Chorus (K. Price) (You must love me repeats in background)
Say that you love me
All I know say that you must love me.
Oh yeah
We used to fight every night
But I never would suffer
Just smile my big brother's
Tryna make me tougher
As we grew fussing and fighting continued
As I plundered through ya stuff
And snuck ya clothes to school
Got intense real intense
As we got older
Never believed it would lead
To me poppin' one in ya shoulda
With my Range knew you had it
'Cause you took too long
As Mickey, Andy, and the girl that bought it looked on
Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand
Told you step outside
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
Made our way down the steps
Maybe you thought it was just a threat
Or maybe ya life was just that crazy
And you was beggin' for death
Try to justify this in my young mind
But the adrenaline
And my ego hurt combined
Drove me berzerk
Saw the devil in your eyes
High off more than weed
Confused I just closed
My young eyes and squeezed
What a sound
Opened my eyes just in time
To see ya stumbling to the ground
Damn what the fuck I done now
Runnin' around in a circle
Thinking I'm assed out
Hot gun burnin' my waist
Ran straight to Jaz's house
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga
And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga
Left the scene how could I go out that way
Still you asked to see me in the hospital the next day
You must love me.
Chorus (You must love me repeats in background)
What after all the wrong I've done
I know you must
Verse 3 (Starts over last line of chorus)
Everything in my power and within my frame
To protect you from this life and
Keep you away from the game
But you was one of the few people
That I can trust
And the fact of the matter I slang
These pies for us
You put the pressure on me dearly
Rarely would you let it go
Was a thousand and one times
I had to tell you no
When it was one of those days
When nobody was around
And I needed emergency trip
Out of town
Searched my mental rolodex
For all the numbers I know
As you stared in my face
Asking me could you go
I'm agreed said sender
Everything'll go smooth
Just tell her what to do
And everything'll go through
Strapped her body with them thangs
As you boarded the plane
Couldn't explain these strange feelings
That I caught and the pain
I'm thinkin' why would I send you
When I knew it ain't right
I'm thinkin' what would
Make you sacrifice ya life
You must love me
Chorus (You must love me repeats in background)
After everything that I've done wrong
I know inside you must love me
I know that you love me
You showed me I know it
I know
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
I know you must love me
Oh yes you do
Inside I know it
You've always shown it
You love me yeah yeah
Oh yeah
I know that you love me"

242,Young Forever,2009,The Blueprint 3 (2009),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,Jay-Z,"Let's dance in style
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever
May the best of your today's
Be the worst of your tomorrows
But we ain't even thinking that far
You naw mean?
So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed
Drink some wine
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut
I'll be fine
I'm forever young
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever
Fear not when, fear not why
Fear not much while were alive
Life is for living not living up tight
See ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations while debating up in barber shops
Young slung, hung here
Shorty, the nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever
Slamming Bentley doors
Hopping out of Porsche's
Popping up on Forbes lists
Gorgeous
Hold up
Niggas thought I lost it
They be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit
They nauseous
Hold up
I'll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars
Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet
I'm painting you a portrait of young
Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever"
