0,A Ha,2006,True Magic (2006),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Mos Def,"Hey hey, ha ha say what say what
Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
'Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminesce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a youngin, before the days of thuggin'
How me and Charlie Chims (aiyyo what?) I'm only buggin
Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin' the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sittin' roadside, that ain't harder to plan
I'm out here for my fam doin' all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown 'cause we grown to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp!) we bust back
Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin' to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first artist, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the judge many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go
Good morninnnnnnnnngg vietnam!
Ha (back up back up back up back up back up) [repeated in background]
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push ya wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Four on the jake got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbin it, form partnership
Increase armorment, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
Shoutout ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representin it
Sittin' on they front stoop sippin Guinesses
Usin' native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenaments
To the Mom and Pop local shop menaces
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we it The Planet
Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncalm
From ?sun? to the ? to the Lafayette Gardens
White ?coff guawinas? in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya goin' wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The nighties, and all my ?yarda trenny? Brown's Village
Parkside tennants caught, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starite City gettin' busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Kanarcy, Farraget, Fullgreen, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be, playin' loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown STRONGLY!
Raise it up!
Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the news tool crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jame is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustlin you can't relax
The crack babies tryin' to find where they mama's at
It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stompin grounds, where you find a pound, smoke is that
Be blazin' charm that have your wave cap floatin back
The doorstep where the disposessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave sellin zovarax
You big ballin better keep your money folded back
'Cause once the young guns notice that it's over, black
Brooklyn keep on takin' it, worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat"

Mad Liberator, Def Operator
Rock the data, amazing flavor
Yo, the way I feel, sometime it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try to chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face but it's really no joke
You feel it in the street, the people breathe without hope
They going through the motion, they dimming down the focus
Their focus get cleared, then their light turn sharp
And the eyes grow teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly, sometimes y'all don't hear me
I push it past the bass, no nations got to feel me
I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake
That I'm hardly ever asleep, my flow forever deep
And it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on the beat
My presence speak volumes, before I say a word
I'm everywhere penthouse, pavement, and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral of a shell
Universal, ghetto life, holla black, you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Shoulders, the lions raw voice is the siren
I swing round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act, could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fighting
Suttins trying to hide, like the struggle won't find him
And the sun bust through the clouds, to clearly remind him
He's everywhere: penthouse, pavement, and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral of a shell
Universal, ghetto life, holla black, you know it well

Here it is
Peace, power, fantastic, original
And always on time, and rocking your mind, it's like
Sit and come relax, riddle of the Mack
It's the patch, I'm a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well say about noonish, coming out the whip
And lookin' at me curious, a young Iraqi kid (Awww)
Carrying laundry, what's wrong G? Hungry?
No, give me my oil, get fuck out my country
In an Arabian market, other stuff
Till his moms come grab him, and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, bitter like I's pissed off on moon
I'm like ""Shorty, hope that we can fix our differences soon! Bye!""
Buying apples, I'm breaking 'em
Brooklyn take everything, why not just take the damn food Black bastard
I don't understand it, on another planet?
15 months of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasing the sentiment, gentlemen
Getting down on their Middle-Eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crap
Walk over, kicked one of my fabulous raps (La-dee Da-dee)
Arab jaws dropped, they well wished, they glad wrapped
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad
What it is

Peace, peace what's up y'all this is Mos Def
And this is a message to the people
If you see or hear goodness from me
Then that goodness is from The Creator
You should be thankful to The Creator for all of that
'Cause I'm not the architect of that
I'm only the... the recipient
If you see weakness or shortcoming in me
It's from my own weakness or shortcoming
And I ask The Creator and the people to forgive me for that
Thank you Brooklyn, Thank you World
Yeah, yeah there it is
Turn my voice up in the top a little bit
It feel good to be back
What's up ochenta?
Yeah, yeah, ha...
It's the Black Dante in your headphones
Speakerbox (freaky radio) freaky radio
(Everywhere on the dial) tell you a little bit about me
For my hometown, break down a little history for you
Myrtle and Broadway, Roosvelt projects, Mossie projects
Listen...
(Verse 1: Mos Def)
I stepped on the field from no league just home team
I Jumped out the stands and I snatched the rock
With the final seconds dwindling on the clock
Mos post up to throw up the tie-breakin shot
I put it through the net and let the world's jaw drop
Then fled the arena before they called cops
Tell the players and the coach I wasn't tryin' to blow spot
But the way they was ballin' made it difficult to watch
I was taught when there's somethin' you can change around
Keep quiet, you got nothin' to complain about
You got work to do, I don't know if that work for you
But that's how Mos work it through
And my work is personal, I'm a workin person
I put in work, I work with purpose
I get it there, on the water, air, the surface
You feel the impact? Niggaz yeah it's workin
Listen God did not make me a fearful person
The only fear I have, Is my failure to adhear his path
I would love it just to hear this back
On the ghetto streets where y'all at
On the ave's where the Jeep's go past
In the coupes where the seats go back
In the parties where it be so packed
And the atmosphere be so black
And them black things be so phat
If I could I would be so glad
But if not I won't be so mad
I'm still being a man, still feeding my fam'
And even if you don't see it my fam
I believe that I am, truly gifted, truly blessed
I'm yours truly, Brooklyn's own, Mos Def
I'm rockin' the hard right, ground zero, to far left
I'm, well balanced, with immense talents
Burn the script, then flip it to keep myself challenged
And that's the mark of a true champ-ine
That's whether I'm in or outside the ring
No fights, no tilte, no crown or reign
Feel my presence even when I'm up out this thing
Just trust, that's what I'm about to be
But until then settle in and rock with me
(Outro: Mos Def)
Ha, that's what its about to be
Ghetto people look alive with me
And say, We 'gon, stop by
Then we just keep movin on
Ghetto people, look alive and
Feel free, we just keep movin on
For Alliah, Left Eye, Jam Master Jay
All the great hero's who have passed away

It's all good, we all here, goin' all out (all out)
All day, listen when this song say
Don't push me 'cause I'm close - To the streets,
To the beach, the bitches, the niggaz,
The women, the children, the workers,
The killers, the addicts, the dealers
The quiet, the livest, the realest
- And that's close
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close
To the edge, back, middle, and front
Strong back shit liftin' it up
From the big and the small
I'm like J. Brown +Gettin' Involved+
Now get yours

(Talking)
It was so beautiful. It was almost unfair.
It's cold but it's true. It was so cold it got warm.
Kids out in the schoolyard and playing.
It was nice and calm. It was dangerous.
When the MC's came, live out the name
And to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane
Before they rocked the don
Now on to the mental pains, spark the brains
Building to be born
Big digger is on the track
Check 'em check chicka icka etta Uh.
(Strange Times)
Everybody got their get high (Oh my)
Their get right, their get nice, they get by (Oh my)
They get open, get ready, get primed
The national pastime is victimless crime
You want your thrill & I want mine
As long we can get it we ain't got to say why
I don't mean to pry, you ain't got to lie
We ain't got to speak when it's written in the eyes
Whenever she was high off the sparkle in her palm
She had a young girl's smile & a hustler's charm
Dying from the city where the hustler's are born
Made, traced, murdered, replaced
Life-long residents barely feel safe
And the street's offer plenty taste and little faith (Break it down)
Little face, soft lips, little waist (Break it more)
Tiny hands (Oh god) bad ass (Oh more)
Big eyes like birthday surprise
Super duper fly, born in 85
Repeat it to yourself: This is a victimless crime
Psyche your mind there's a victim every time
Your tasty little pill, your freaky little thrill
Pray won't leave you still, you wonder how it feel
It's real, pussy like some money that you steal.
Eww
When the MC came, fill out the name
And to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane
Before they rocked the don
Now on to the mental pains, spark the brains
Building to be born
Give the people a new drug.
Crime and Medicine
Dead wrong and live in America
Off the block and right in your area
Fresh apples and peaches for the president

Crime and Medicine
Dead wrong and live in your area

Fresh apples and peaches for the president

11,Dollar Day,2006,True Magic (2006),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Mos Def,"So there's a story about the lady in Louisiana
She's a flood survivor and the rescue teams
They come through, and they, I guess tryna recover people
And they see this women she's wadin through the streets
I guess it'd been some time after the storm
And I guess they were shocked that you know she was alive
And rescue worker said, ""So, oh my God h-how did you survive
How did you do it? Where've you been?""
And she said, ""Where I been? Where you been?""
Hah, Where you been? You understand?
That's about the size of it.
This for the streets, the streets everywhere
The streets affected by the storm called... America
I'm doin' this for y'all, and for me, for the Creator.
God save these streets
One dollar per every human being
Feel that Katrina clap
See that Katrina clap.
Listen, homey, it's Dollar Day in New Orleans
It's water water everywhere and people dead in the streets
And Mr. President he bout that cash
He got a policy for handlin the niggas and trash
And if you poor you black
I laugh a laugh they won't give when you ask
You better off on crack
Dead or in jail, or with a gun in Iraq
And it's as simple as that
No opinion my man it's mathematical fact
Listen, a million poor since 2004
And they got ...illions and killions to waste on the war
And make you question what the taxes is for
Or the cost to reinforce, the broke levee wall
Tell the boss, he shouldn't be the boss anymore
Y'all pray amin

But if you ain't about the ghetto then fuck you too
Who care bout rock 'n' roll when babies can't eat food
Listen homie man that shit ain't cool
It's like Dollar Day for New Orleans
It's water water everywhere and homies dead in the streets
And Mr. President's a natural ass

People seem to find that interesting
High status, intrigue and mystery
Special code name on the hotel registry
I love it when they say enjoy your stay
You see how they mean it 'cause that's the way they've been trained
Show you to your room, a suite with a view
Well, if anything at all, do not hesitate to call
Nice, the greatest, the greatest
Compliments, tooth brush, tooth paste, razors
A Bible, a Quran in a drawer or depending where you are
Tend to whisper through the walls, she was calling on God
The greatest, the greatest
Salutations, congratulations, reservations, exclusive arrangements
Dinner with the patrons, the scenery is amazing
It's so outrageous, they whisper when they say it
When it's really real it's even realer than the matrix
Classic, modern, ancient flagrant
Get a special thrill every time they get to say it, peace
I work with the embassy
On behalf of imagination industry
I come visit, you come visit
Such a pleasure, official business
The embassy

13,Fake Bonanza,2006,True Magic (2006),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Mos Def,"Hip hop, modern time, flossy and raw so self-absorbed, immature
I can't remember being this bored
Fake bonanza, there come real wars
Bullets burn through the candy on the driver side door
Long investigations and no firm lead, billion dollar flow
And black life is still cheap
Your rent skyrockets and y'all prospects plummet
10 murders, 10 days, this summer
Talk about today's mathematics, a 8th, an O, a key
And the caliber on your rack, shit
The inmate number, the centerfolds for measurement
Is close as a coed cell come to some tendon-is
I heard them say it was All About The Benjamin's
I don't believe it now, didn't believe it then, fuck what you heard
You believe what you want, the truth is what it is, it be what it been
Get rich, shorty just tryin' to live
Don't believe in heaven and ain't tryin' to get in
And hell is everyday, fuck the world anyway
Potion and sips, spark up a clip, FADE AWAY!
The low lights, tree top heights
Be careful how you move the traps are covered in the lights
Landmines be disguised as welcome signs
I'll repeat it so you ain't got to press rewind
The landmines be disguised as welcome signs
Black fresh from Iraq, a wild look in his eyes, missing part of his arm.
What the fuck is your problem!? Oh lord! Fake Bonanza!
Gladiator, circus world
Glamour, pussy, pimp, hoe good to serve this world
Paranoid, if she trick a nigga nervous world
Shade-tonic natural order in reversal world
The iPod, no God, 0 circle world
The blow-a turtle world, smoke from the purple world
The killer murder world, hamburger murder world
Open 24 hours, all about them dollars
Pretty poison, devoid choices
Cold coffee and more coffers, Fake Bonanza
Cold coffee and more coffers, Fake Bonanza
Huh? What? I don't understand ya!
What they talking bout save they soul, oh lord, save they soul!
Help them reach the goal, peace!
Help them reach the goal, peace!
Help them reach the goal, peace!
Help them reach the goal, peace!
You know, peace
You know, peace
You know, peace, boogieman! Don't be scared
Oh lord, save they soul
Oh lord, save they soul
Oh lord, save my soul
Oh lord, save my soul
Please

Woke up this morning with my, my state don't fade and said I
Had the baddest feeling, maybe you stayed on my mind, said I
Had the baddest feeling, maybe you stayed on my mind, said I
Woke up this morning in my, my state, I'm dreaming, dreaming
Ain't nothing even... dreaming, praying, keeping
Woke up this morning and my mind stayed on freedom
Woke up this demon that keep staying on my mind
Said, woke up this morning and my mind stayed on freedom
It makes no difference what people say."
14,Fear Not of Man,1999,Black on Both Sides (1999),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Mos Def,"Ooh-ooh, ooh, whee
That was for Brooklyn
Haha, we get it every time
(You got me on? Oh)
Shout out to all of my crew, East-West, North-South
All the continent, Europe, all abroad international
(Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in, bring it in)
It's a lot of things goin' on y'all
Twenty-first century is comin', twentieth century almost done
A lot of things have changed
A lot of things have not, mainly us
We gon' get it together right? I believe that
Listen, people be askin' me all the time
""Yo Mos, what's gettin' ready to happen with hip hop?"" (Where do you think hip hop is goin'?)
I tell 'em, ""You know what's gonna happen with hip hop whatever's happening with us""
If we smoked out, hip hop is gonna be smoked out
If we doin' all right, hip hop is gonna be doin' all right
People talk about hip hop like it's some giant livin' in the hillside, comin' down to visit the townspeople
We are hip hop
Me, you, everybody, we are hip hop
So hip hop is goin' where we goin'
So the next time you ask yourself where hip hop is goin'
Ask yourself, ""Where am I goin'? How am I doin'?""
Till you get a clear idea
So if hip hop is about the people
And the hip hop won't get better until the people get better
Then how do people get better? (Hmm)
Well, from my understanding people get better
When they start to understand that, they are valuable
And they not valuable because they got a whole lot of money
Or 'cause somebody, think they sexy
But they valuable 'cause they been created by God
And God makes you valuable
And whether or not you recognize that value is one thing
You got a lot of societies and governments
Tryin' to be God, wishin' that they were God
They wanna create satellites and cameras everywhere and make you think they got the all-seein' eye
Eh, I guess the Last Poets wasn't too far off when they said that certain people got a god complex, I believe it's true
I don't get phased out by none of that, none of that helicopters, the TV screens, the newscasters, the satellite dishes, they just wishin'
They can't really never do that
When they tell me to fear they law, when they tell me to try to have some fear in my heart behind the things that they do
This is what I think in my mind
And this is what I say to them and this is what I'm sayin', to you check it
All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm
Fear not of men because men must die
Mind over matter and soul before flesh
Angels for the pain keep a record in time
Which is passin' and runnin' like a caravan freighter
The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked
But God is sufficient in disposin' of affairs
Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear
But God is sufficient over plans they prepared
Mos Def in the flesh, where you at? Right here
On this place called Earth, holdin' down my square
'Bout to do it for y'all, and y'all at the fair
So just bounce, come on bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
And just
Just step two three
Just step two three and step two
Two, three and
One, two, three, and four
One, two, three, and four
One, two, three, and four
(One, two, three) Once again
All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm
Fear not of men because men must die
Mind over matter and soul before flesh
Angels for the pain keep a record in time
Which is passin' and runnin' like a caravan freighter
The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked
But God is sufficient in disposin' of affairs
Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear
But God is sufficient over plans they prepared
Mos Def in the flesh, where you at? Right here
On this place called Earth, holdin' down my square
'Bout to represent in your whole atmosphere
'Bout to represent in your whole atmosphere
To your atmosphere, to your atmosphere

And then the jooks go down, all at once they like
Don't get me, don't get me
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me
Don't get me, don't get me
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me
Don't get me, don't get me
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me
Don't get me, don't get me
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me
You're out on the block hustling at the spot
Got, this is how you get got
At the gamblin' spot and your hand is mad hot
Got, this is how you get got
Out in Brooklyn late night flashing all of your rocks
Got, this is how you get got
Some girl from pink house said, ""I like you a lot""
Got, this is how you get got
This one goes to all them Big Will cats
With ice on they limbs and big rims on they Ac
You goin' around town with your system bump
And your windows cracked low to profile and front
Now I like to have nice things just like you
But I'm from Brooklyn, certain shit you just don't do
Like, high postin' when you far from home
Or like, high postin' when you all alone
Now, this would seem to be clear common sense
But cats be livin' off, sheer confidence
Like, ""Fuck that, picture them tellin' me run that""
But acting invincible, just ain't sensible
It's nineteen ninety-now, and there's certain individuals
Swear they rollin' hard and get robbed on principle
Five star general, flashin' on your revenue
You takin' a ride on the downstate medical, Like whoo
Colorful sparks, yellow and blue
A full on attack and it's happening to you
Wit' nothing you can do but bust back and cop a plea
But five of them and one of you, that equals got to me
Don't get me, don't get me
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me
Don't get me, don't get me
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me
Don't get me, don't get me
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me
Don't get me, don't get me
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me
Come on y'all now, let's be real
Some jokers got a rough time keepin' it concealed
I wonder what it mean, it's probably self-esteem
They fiendin' to be seen, get hemmed like Gabardines
Cats think it can't happen until the gats start clappin'
They comin' down the wire spittin' fire like a dragon
'Cause while the goods glisten, certain eyes take position
To observe your trickin', then catch that ass slippin'
Like, come on now ock, what you expect?
Got a month's paycheck danglin' off your neck
And while you Cristal sippin', they rubbin' up they mittens
With heat in mint condition to start the getti-gettin'
They clique starts creepin' like Sandinista guerrillas
You screamin' playa haters, these niggas is playa killers
Mr. Fashion, that style never last long
The harder you flash, the harder you get flashed on
There's hunger in the street that is hard to defeat
Many steal for sport, but more steal to eat
Cat's heavy at the weigh-in, and he's playin' for keeps
Don't sleep, they'll roll up in your passengers seat
There is universal law, whether rich or poor
Some say life's a game, to more, life is war
So put them egos to the side and get off them head trips
'Fore some cats pull out them heaters and make you headless
Don't get me, don't get me
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me
Don't get me, don't get me
Don't g-g-g-g-g-get me
Don't get me, don't get me

Under, wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony
These niggaz wanna be Pistol Pete -without the penalty
His last words, promise me this much in death
Don't my boy live to retrace my steps
Minne- stay safe move quiet and get it
If you encounter opposition get a inch from they face with It
Later amigo, digest the day to end discreetly
Sex money and boss
My ties to hear me see me
True villain
Face covered, driving gloves
Commit by my lonely when push comes to shove
They say that grown men lay on they prey
Took shorts in the street
Came back and made up for that with that white sheet
Revenge is best served cold
Get it the same way you give it
This ain't fear I just need to get away with it
Son stop over here (?), you looking at me like I'm lame
But I'm looking at y'all like y'all call this the drug game
Grand child hosing sims
Put the heroin in queens
Put Pops Freeman on in the early seventies
I sat in rooms with money machines
Drugs sitting 3 feet off of the floor
Cover the smell of the raw
Chest moves like bars scale my connects untimely
King Henry from 12th street flooded the Bronx in the 90's
03 scene MVP and one Accord
Boss makes decision paper wins awards
(Mos Def)
See Me, Hear Me
Welcome to Brooklyn, New York City 11206
Roosevelt Projects, wild rose water the plant
Son you know what it is
From the moment that you come over the bridge
And if you don't ride with me
I'm gonna show you some shit
Ima show you where my niggaz stay sure on the mix
Ima show you where the pain and the poetry is
Ghetto young'ns spend a lot of time alone in the crib
BET on the screen, walls and posters of BIG
Hustlers getting dough sitting low on the 6
Blazing up the ambro glow over they wrist
Hop in the game knowing the risk
Still down to load up they clip
Gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip
But when you hear head crack there ain't no rolling again
Snatch the dice and everything you want is going it in
This how it happens, good people, bad habits, diabetics, crack addicts
Asthmatics
Searching for the truth leaping through the holy tablet
The bible, the Q uran, or the ten crack commandments
Speak on it God, What's today's mathematics
The five day forecast, the Dow Jones average
The price of beer, cigarettes, bread, milk and pampers
Life is a test and we all got the answer
The streets keep calling its hard not answer
And on my government-my attribute-my all
So it's only natural I holla black and respond
Brooklyn stand up and make 'em all sit down
(?) We do not fuck around
That's what it is (All Day)
That's what is Niggaz (Official, Official)
That's how it is Niggaz
BX, BK live all day
Get with it

We all got to have, a place where we come from (Home, a place where someone lives, a residence)
This place that we come from is called home (A residence, the physical structure within which one lives, such as a house)
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can (A dwelling place with the social unit that occupies it, a household)
We travel this big earth as we roam (An environment offering security and happiness, a valued place a native habitat)

Said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at (On or into the point at which something is directed to the center or the heart)
I come up in the street around some real wild brothers
With more than one name and more than one baby mother
More than one case, been on more than one run
Got more than one enemy and more than one gun
Partner, all that's left to want is more
While these cats that's less privileged is just more raw
Less space 'cause the projects laced with more flaws
Less sleep 'cause the nights ain't peace, it's more war
The can is raw like thirsty, rainy season thunder claps
On the block with your old pop pleading number act
To the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at
To the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped
With the jungle cats, lions and tigers, leopards and cheetahs
For gazelle you get chased like a zebra, they blaze cheeba-cheeba
And dominate the weaker on the street
Hungry bellies only love what they eat and it's hard to compete
When they smile with your heart in they teeth
And the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath
Son I been plenty places in my life and time
And regardless where home is, son home is mine
We've all got to have, a place where we come from (In this world, travelin', travelin', travelin')
This place that we come from is called home (So many places I go)
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can (In this world, travelin', travelin')
We travel this big earth and we roam (Roam, roam, roam)
We all got to have, a place where we come from (Livin' all over the world)
This place that we come from is called home (Got to have someplace they call home)
Even though we may love, this place on the map (Yeah, place on the map)
Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at (Yeah, hey)
Some people live out in New York City
And some people live out in Atlanta
And some people got to live Chicago
And some people do live Miami
And all my people at California
And other people got to live London
And everybody got to live in the whole big world
Together just you and me
When I think of home, my remembrance of my beginning
Laundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen
Chillin' in front my building with my brother and them
Spending nights in Bushwick with my cousins and them
Wise town and Beat Street, uh federal relief
Slowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat
Sticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep
With every flavor Now and Later only a dime apiece
Old timers on the bench playing cards and thangs
Telling tales about they used to be involved in things
Start to drinking, talking loud, cussing up and showing out
On the phone, call the cops, pick 'em up, move 'em out
And it's all too common to start wildin'
I'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence
And it's hard to find, block parties in dark lobbies
Funeral homes packed but only dark bodies
I can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley
Marley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall
Son I been to many places in my space and time
And whatever my home is, son home is mine
We've all got to have, a place where we come from (In this world, travelin', travelin', travelin')
This place that we come from is called home (So many places I go)
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can (Set on our travels, do the best I can)
We travel this big earth and we roam (The best I know)
We all got to have, a place where we come from (We all got to have, someplace to call home)
This place that we come from is called home (Someplace to call home)
Even though we may love, this place that's on the map (This place on the map)
Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at (Where you at, where you at)
Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at, say what, say what?
Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at, where to hang your hat
Said it ain't where you from, it's where you at, where to hang your hat

Come on y'all let's rock this!
You say one for the tempo, two for the time
Come on!
Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall... (Hungh!)
My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still
Committed to page, I write a rhyme
Sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature, from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister
Subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
(Ha ha ha) From the core to the perimeter black,
You know the motto
Stay fluid even in staccato
(Mos Def) Full blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the trunk hollow
There's the hum, young man where you from
Brooklyn number one
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (there it is)
While you still try to follow where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies
Violently, so silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's English
But caught a rash on my lips
So now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (switch)
Move like an apparition
Float to the ground with ammunition (chi-chi-chi-POW)
Move from the gate, voice cued on your tape
Putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate
Who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping
To Be-Bopping
To Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(Where ya at) I'm high, low, east, west,
All over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock
The fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop
Then the phone calls...
Chill for a minute
Let's see who else tops
Snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself ock
The industry just a better built cellblock
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)
*Scratching*
Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
The out of court settlement
Ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits (hungh!)
Luxury tenements choking the skyline
It's low life getting tree-top high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter intent to the memory
A class E felony
Facing the death penalty (hungh!)
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with
On time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness
Remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot
The working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box
Sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black glock
Gold medallist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woo)
It's all city like phase two
Hip Hop will simply amaze you
Praise you, pay you
Do whatever you say do
But black, it can't save you"

Everybody act according to the season that they born in
Some in the night, some in the morning
Some at noon
Some in winter, some in June
It's all cool, it's the natural
Science is a jewel
For me and mines, yours and you
Let's move
Tell you a little about mine, yo
I was born in a season where the world was quiet and cold
Celebrations were going on
Some were happy, some were sad
Some felt bad from being good
Some felt good from being bad
Feelings pass and change, but they never leave
They here to stay
Holiday, holiday, happy birthday
Teenage love, the first cut run deep
Soul on flesh, this is the Brooklyn streets
Year of the Ox, seven and three
M.D., the history (come on)
Every soul got one of these (yes)
It's where you been and where you be
And without understanding you cannot proceed
Complete
The start and the end
Then it just go round again
Again

Again and again, brand new (yeah)
Again and again, so fresh (fresh)
Again and again, newness
(Talib Kweli)
I was born in the decade of decadence where they worship what they have
Ford was president, do the math
The war was ended when the North Vietnamese stormed the city of Saigon
We was like ""bye,"" we was gone, let bygones be bygones
I'm goin' spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Where they hug you with the firearm, try it on
Like new school clothes, Black Star official
Smash when we do shows, facts, no mystery
I'm down with the crew like Mussolini in Italy
I rock with The Roots like the Giving Tree
Powerful, bigotry at work, me and my people got history
These rappers dumb it down considerably
We get it poppin' like a hit chorus
The flow is historic, they can't get rid of us, ubiquitous
And we lay the law like Leviticus
Ten years ago we made history, so they missing us
(Mos Def)
And don't call it comeback in particular
Even if it blend into ephemera or fade into periphera
Transition of the minister's original
We're broadcast clear without diminishers
Black Star, stove top burning soul temperatures and ministers
Alkalines, aminos and minerals, it's sensuous
Served over Dilla time signatures
It's miracle material, remember it's right now
Foreverness"

I strike the empire back
I strike the empire back
Fuck the empire
High flying like the Millennium Falcon piloted by Han Solo
I never roll for dolo, fronting on me's a no-no
Understand, doing this for my fam
Ha ha, check it out y'all
Yo I'm trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense
Add it up, told my daddy I'd be a rich man
You never know when your fate gon' switch hand
Get today's solid ground out of yesterday's quicksand
I was a young boy who dreamt about being a big man
On small looseleaf sheets I sketched a big plan
Gotta handle business properly, boost up my economy
Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property
Yesterday was not for me but nowaday it's time for me
The streets is watching me, I watch back that's the policy
Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery
Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless
Let those who make the exodus seekin' the north beacon
From beating and hog-eating, from punishment all season
From hands cracked and bleeding, cotton thorns in your palms
It's for y'all that I sketch these songs and it goes
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear no man because faith is the arrow
My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow
We can blow with the ammo or go mano-a-mano
Kweli is you with me? (What up, what up?) Let's make it happen
I burn through your argument with action
My eyes stay fastened to tomorrow looking for a brighter day
When y'all wanna leave y'all, right away

From outlaw (to MCs), make it happen (Do your thing) understand

Guess who? The illest emcee in the atmosphere, yeah the Soul Controller
Who roam the frontier like a Buffalo Soldier
I follow the code of honor like a real man gonna
Never disrespect no women 'cause I love my mama
These cats be giving us praise but it ain't that accurate
I give it up to God, all that love and attachment get
Scary well-prepared with the shears when it get hairy
Like how these niggas is looking like some fairies and singing like canaries to the beast
And anybody who will listen to 'em clearly, y'all don't hear me though
Even when I'm coming through in stereo
You make a mockery of what I represent properly
Yo, why you starting me? I take that shit straight to the artery
Intellectual property I got the title and the deed
I pay for rent, with the tears and sweat and what I bleed
Emcees imitate the way we walk, the way we talk
You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought
Plus your flow a little bit off, you come across soft
Back in the days niggas like that on stage got tossed off
Need to get crossed off the guestlist
It's like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit to get the message
Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace
When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless
Check it, emcees in my face after I slug you then I hug you
If I gotta dead you, know it's only 'cause I love you

It don't stop till we complete this (and know that I love you), keep this fly
It's so much to life when you just stay black, stay black, stay black, stay black
Stay black, stay black, stay black, stay black
Stay black, stay black

Bright moments always come back vivid.
The 5th grade was epic, citywide test pressure
The pre-crack era!
Mr. Schollmen, what a prick, attitude matched his wardrobe, uglier then sin.
This is Bed-Stuy 82'
9th floor, 3 tiny rooms one view.
Buck-town, Roosevelt house
They green grass is green
Our green grass is brown.
Shots rang my phone wasn't Touch-Tone
A heavy beef in the street
ET had to flee
Great heavens! Good grief!
Hungry bellies, bright gold on they teeth!
The windows on the Ave look like sad eyes
They fix their sharp gaze on you when you pass by
And if you dare to stand, you can see 'em cry
You can watch 'em scowl,
Feel 'em prowl
Wall and study every inch about you
Fast math measuring what you amount to
The laughter, the screams!
The numeral, the song of Psalms
The book of dreams!
Ends don't meet where the arms can't reach
Mean streets,
Even when its free it ain't cheap.
Ongoing saga, terminal diagnosis,
Basic survival requires super-heroics.
No space in the budget for a cape
It's when you gotta fly by night to save the day
Crash landings routinely happen
Some survive, others never rise from the ashes
Watching asphalt and observing the Sabbath
Creates an ecstatic and there you have it
From teenage love, pray in tongues
Strange fruit, batty boots and native drums
From hence I come
So here we go
Signs and wonders all along the road
Some lies open, some lies close
Some stretchers role with no lies at all.
Some riders don't know what they riding for
Hands on the wheel and their mind is gone
Wherever you ride, whatever your name,
This raw cold life is a beautiful thing
And we are alive in amazing times
Delicate hearts, diabolical minds
Revelations, hatred, love and war.
And more and more and more and more
And more of less than ever before
It's just too much more for your mind to absorb
It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt
We can't be alive in no time but... now!
It's just another shot to the heart,
It's just a sure shot in the dark,
It's just another place in the stars
Wonders on every side, life in marvelous times
Life in marvelous times
Rock, everywhere
All over the world, you can feel it
All over the world, you can feel it,
Spirit rise everywhere
It's just another shot to the heart,
It's just a sure shot in the dark,
It's just another place in the stars

They say the goodness in life belongs to those who believe
So, I believe... YES!
I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing I'm trapped in between the line
I escape when I finish the rhyme (aiyyo)
My pops said he was in love when he made me
Thought about it for a second, wasn't hard to see
I could hear he was sincere, was a game of promotion
The entire affair's probably charged wit emotion
But love call your heart, I guess you got to pursue
12-11-73 my life is testament
Praise the beneficent, element that rest
Devoid in the form that make love manifest
I spent my early years in Roosevelt Project
It was a bright valley wit some dark prospects
In '83, Venny C was the host wit the most
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
This is far before the days of high glamour and pose
Aiyyo power from the street light made the place dark
I know a few understand what I'm talkin' about
It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
Spendin time, writin rhymes
Tryin' to find words that describe the vibe
That's inside the space
When you close yo' eyes and screw yo' face
Is this the pain of too much tenderness
To make me nod my head in reverence
Should I visit this place in rememberence
To build landmarks here as evidence
Nighttime, spirit shook my temperament
To write rhymes that portray this sentiment
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
We live the now for the promise of the infinite

Ears and eyes keepin' good time wit the rhythm

You know the deal, it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, negroes and latinos
And even the gringos
Yo, check it, one for Charlie Hustle, two for Steady Rock
Three for the forthcoming live future shock
It's five dimensions, six senses, seven firmaments of Heaven and Hell
Eight million stories to tell
Nine planets faithfully keep in orbit with the probable tenth
The universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide project-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor, better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the cha-pow, you dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got sixteen to thirty bars to rock it
But only fifteen percent of profits ever see my pockets like
Sixty-nine billion in the last twenty years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a ki
A five-minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
Forty percent of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right, you are not alone
Rock your hardhat black 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies, and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This new math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme you better learn how to add, it's mathematics
The Mighty Mos Def (It's simple mathematics)
(Check it out) (I revolve around science)
(What are we talking about here?)
The Mighty Mos Def (It's simple mathematics)

Do your math
Do your math
(One, two, three, four)
(What are we talking about here?)
Yo, it's one universal law but two sides to every story
Three strikes and you be in for life, mandatory
Four MC's murdered in the last four years
I ain't trying to be the fifth one, the millennium is here
Yo it's six million ways to die, from the seven deadly thrills
Eight-year olds getting found with nine mills
It's 10 PM, where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill pumping krill to keep they belly filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get cream
The white unemployment rate? It's nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still living
Join the other five million under state supervision
This is business, no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your zip code to SSI digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
Two columns for ""Who is"" and ""Who ain't niggas""
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back? Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it, it's all mathematics
The Mighty Mos Def (It's simple mathematics)

I come home high and she start to cry
I can't take it

That won't make it
She be home with the kids, this is no way to live
What can I say?
I know it's surreal but I'm a hard headed still
Do things my way
And he's so strong, so strong
It's like I'm dying
Trying to hold on, my body says Oh No, Oh
Out there flying, the price that I pay for the game that I play
Ain't no game at all,
I'm up in the clouds then I'm spiraling down
Nothing breaks the fall
And he's so strong, so strong
It's like I'm dying
Trying to hold on, my body says Oh No, Oh
Out there, flying
Sounds of the sufferers pray
Silent noise and the sufferers pray
They say yes
I come home high and she start to cry
I can't take it
A brand new excuse does me no use

She be home with the kids, this is no way to live

Ghetto people in the world today, Get up

Mother, mother, had in her hands her first born son dead in her hands
The whole thing was a setup, a scam
They knew it was set up and planned niggas he worked with
Brother, brother
I don't see no brother hug all I see is thugger hug
Get rich and fuck the hug
All in one there's some gun smoke from the hug
Lookin' for the shorty gun stroke from the hug
That's how they touch the hug
But when I touch the hug, I'll make it bright or black
Because I'm bright or black
And I'm so black I'm bright, shine through the blackest night
Shine when I'm live, shine via satellite
Shout in the hood we get the picture
Cause every time you in the hood you got photographers with ya
What's going on?
Understand this is real life
This how it goes on, this how it goes on
It keep going on, this how it goes on
Ghetto people look alive get free
Get involved, remain to breathe
If Marvin was alive now, wow, what would I say to him?
Where could I start, how could I explain to him?
I know the modern world probably looks strange to him
Would he feel like the day had a place for him?
Global imprisonment sickness indifference
When he said save the babies was we listenin'
When he said Merci Merci did he really know that decades later we'd still be killin' folks
Did he hope, that we would realize
That we the first, son of earth
The moon and stars, the great beyond
We black and proud, we brave and strong
We raise it up, we quiet storm, forever fresh
And keep it on
Ghetto people look alive and free and get real
This how it goes on, and you say you say
This how it goes on, and you say you say
This how it goes on
Ghetto people look alive and free and breathe
Hold the beat, stop the beat, drop the beat <repeat 3 times>
Hold the beat, stop the beat, got the beat
There ain't nothin' to be afraid of
Ghetto people look alive and free and get real
This how it goes on, this how it goes on, keep goin' on, this how it goes on

Who is the cat eatin out on the town
And make the whole dining room turn they head round
Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Who be ridin' up in the highrise elevator
Other tenants who be prayin' they ain't the new neighbor
Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga
They try to play him like a chump 'cause he got what they want
He under thirty years old but already he's a pro
Designer trousers slung low ccause his pockets stay swoll'
Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go
V.I.P. at the club, backstage at the show
(Yes y'all) the best crib, the best clothes
Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze (say word)
Checks with O's o-o-o-o-ohs
Straight all across the globe watch got three time-zones
Keep the digital phone up to his dome
Two assistants, two bank accounts, two homes
One problem; even with the O's on his check
The po-po stop him and show no respect
""Is there a problem officer?"" Damn straight, it's called race
That motivate the jake (woo-woo) to give chase
Say they want you successful, but that ain't the case
You livin' large, your skin is dark they flash a light in your face
Now, who is cat dining out on the town
Maitre'd wanna take a whole year to sit him down
Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat at Armani buyin wears
With the tourists who be askin him, do you work here?
Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga
Nigga, Nigga
Yo, the Abstract with the Mighty Mos Def
White folks got it muffled across beneath they breathe
""I didn't say it..""
But they'll say it out loud again
When they get with they close associates and friends
You know, sneak it in with they friends at the job
Happy hour at the bar while this song is in they car
And even if they've never said it, lips stay sealed
They actions reveal how their hearts really feel
Like, late night I'm on a first class flight
The only brother in sight the flight attendant catch fright
I sit down in my seat, 2C
She approach officially talkin' about, ""Excuse me""
Her lips curl up into a tight space
'Cause she don't believe that I'm in the right place
Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped
All embarrassed put an extra lime on my water glass
An hour later here she comes by walkin' past
""I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph""
(Wowwww... Mr. Nigga I love you, I have all your albums!..)
They stay on nigga patrol on American roads
And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law
Some folks get on a plane go as they please
But I go over seas and I get over-SEIZED
London Heathrow, me and my people
They think that illegal's a synonym for negro
Far away places, customs agents flagrant
They think the dark face is smuggle weight in they cases
Bags inspected, now we arrested
Attention directed to contents of our intestines
Urinalyis followed by X-rays
Interrogated and detained till damn near the next day
No evidence, no apology and no regard
Even for the big American rap star
For us especially, us most especially
A Mr Nigga VIP jail cell just for me
""If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake
Just got some shoe-polish, painted my face""
They say they want you successful, but then they make it stressful
You start keepin' pace, they start changin up the tempo
Now, who is cat riding out on the town
State trooper wanna stop him in his ride, pat him down
Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill
They gotta send it to the back to make sure the shit is real
Mr Nigga, Nigga, Nigga
Nigga, Nigga... Nigga
You can laugh and criticize Michael Jackson if you wanna
Woody Allen, molested and married his step-daughter
Same press kickin dirt on Michael's name
Show Woody and Soon-Yi at the playoff game, holdin' hands
Sit back and just bug, think about that
Would he get that type of dap if his name was Woody Black?
O.J. found innocent by a jury of his peers
And they been fuckin' with that nigga for last five years
Is it fair, is it equal, is it just, is it right?
Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white?
If white boys doin' it, well, it's success
When I start doin', well, it's suspect
Don't hate me, my folks is poor, I just got money
America's five centuries deep in cotton money
You see a lot of brothers caked up, yo straight up
It's new, y'all livin' off of slave traders paper
But I'm a live though, yo I'm a live though
I'm puttin' up the big swing for my kids yo
Got my mom the fat water-front crib yo
I'm a get her them pretty bay windows
I'm a cop a nice home to provide in
A safe environment for seeds to reside in
A fresh whip for my whole family to ride in

For a moment that it's too soon to forget (I was in love with this girl, y'know, I was to' up dog)
I know, I can't afford to stop (I'm tellin' you man, she was wild man, f'real)
For a moment that it's too soon to forget (It's just too, let me tell you about her)
In she came with the same type game
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn
What's your name love, where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leaving now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up, shaking, winding her waist up
Scene two, my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""Ayo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (Say word), it was the same pretty bird
Who I had priorly observed trying to play me for the herb
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feeling? ""Oh, I'm fine"" My name is Mos ""I'm Sharice""
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sitting directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh, yeah, you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me?""
I know, I can't afford to stop (She blew my whole head with that duke, I was like, word?)
For a moment that it's too soon to forget (I played it low though, I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go, niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell ya)
I know, I can't afford to stop (Yo, honey was so blazing she was just, yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother man)
For a moment that it's too soon to forget (She was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor and she start whispering to me and shit)
""Yo, let me apologize for the other night
I know it wasn't right, but baby you know what it's like
Some brothers don't be coming right, I understand, I'm feeling you
Besides, can I have a dance ain't really that original""
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""
Scene three, weeks of dating late night conversation
In the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Isaacs
Like, ""If I don't, if I don't have you""
Showing me her tan line and her tattoo
Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., come now, I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rocking the P-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever
Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really trying to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ah, damn it, my shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kitty Club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up, what?"
30,Murder Of A Teenage Life,2006,True Magic (2006),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Mos Def,"The murder of a teenage life
Fire from the cold steel
The heat from the brights
The temperature of flesh and the shortness of breath
The murder of a teenage threat
The aroma of sesamilia Dollar Superstar
Skama like a new cocaine tobacco leaf
Ecstatic tabernists fire water and freaks
The murder of a teenage chief
My easy speaking is as easy as it seems to be
Hungry belly jamma busts off easily
Balloon bang. POP!
Hot as a bang spot in Bangkok
Colder than a pimp glock
Aim shot, the frame drops
Pressure pushed him to the earth like a rain drop
Take not life in vein
And how the preacher was saying
Remember!
Anyways they laid him in a stray box
Dark suit and gray socks
The neighborhood is all distraught
Candles lit the stoop at the park
Where the family and students are
Confused, in awe
They gape into each others arms
It's murder!
New absence from a mothers arm
Even the warmth from the mother's arms
Couldn't keep her son from harm
From standing where the gun was drawn
Over come, done and done. He's gone...
Murder!
Shells fell like a bell that rung
Blood bursts, body temperature fell and plunged
And by the time it took the medics to come
The breath eased out of his lungs
And his soul eased out of the slums
And the voice eased out of the drums
The sirens through their ears, they sung
Murder!
Telephone wire, sneakers hung
Murder!
For the Black and young
Murder!
And the Aves they from
I am from the block the PRESIDENT DID NOT CAMPAIGN ON
Where the dollar that the working poor slave for is made on
Where hustlers stretch the yay long
And hustle hard for an outpost to trade on
Flip it over and make more
Where the blocks are yellow taped off
Where the young blood is trained on Obese to the Fakesoft
Where the pressure just stays on
But the lights and the heat don't
The place where you witness the true power of street folk
And that's where I'm coming from people
High post, low key
Eighth, o-z, and kilo
Law man, dope man
Adversary, amigo
Preacher man, pimp hand
Both folding their C-notes
A Black Fist clutching deliverance for the People
Young hand reach out, strong hand reach in
Slap the devil's hand to make the fucker stop reaching."

To give reporters of his death, the world's greatest nay
It ain't hear or say, you can see it for your own two
Sucker or get close and feel it if you want to
But I know you, you won't and can't do
Seamstress and lies are bustin' up your handle
Palms and fingertips on ultra-blister
You crossed a good dude now he cued the ultra-disher
Shell position fill your old tradition self
Machine gun ran in the pad and clipped himself
Now your project sinks up leakin
Hand over head and the sticky red is seepin
Weepin willow goin' onry ape shit
Little homey onlooker shout,""He ain't gon' make it!""
The moment where bullies find God
Dumb-ass, he been on the scene all along
Tried to help you steer clear, you sped up to the climax
The brick wall on your cheeks worse than Imax
Heavy child I know you wish you never tried black
Dante air blow craft you can't hijack
Yes, but really I digress
Let me step aside and let the EMS clean up the drecks
Extra gore soak the medics to they own asshole
I pray peace on your soul now BEGONE~!

Believe me when I tell you
I never meant to break your heart
May God pick up the pieces
Of dreams that fall apart
Forgive me and forget me
Make a brand new start
Don't blink your eyes and say goodbye
'Cause I know, you know that, I know, you know what love is
Cowboys and girls, oh baby
I remember when we used to play
Cowboys and girls, oh baby

Pretty nigga heart skipped the metronome
Rocked the Trump Tower to the terrordome
Poor house to pleasure domes
Soprano, alto, tenor to baritone
MOS DEF one of the illest that you ever known
Rock steady baby, you a stepping stone
Smash your foundation into pebbles
My words leave your nerves unsettled
You take it to the next level down
Looking like a circus clown
Cats like you can't even get a pound
Worldwide from the river to lakeside
My stage show stay live, make the sound man stage dive
I cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines
I'm home 'fore I'm done with all nine
Got you shook like a fault line
Come all shine and get tarnished
Brooklyn got your pay roll garnished
They form a huddle
Whisper like they want trouble
I melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles
Make the proud-hearted leave on the humble
Black steel in the hour
Assemble my skill form my power
My poems crush bones into powder
You mumble like a coward
I'm Mos Def, you need to speak louder
Super hereos!
Get your power, your masks and capes snatched
Brooklyn take what you can't take back
I know a lot of cats hate that
All I can say black
There's a city full of walls you can post complaints at
All the doubters and believers adjust your receivers
""I feel it,"" you can taste it through the speakers

Make you peal out and mash your shit
Get wild cold crash your whip
Front chassis wrecked, but ock you can't be too upset

I'm permanent like tattoos and birth marks
Third degree burn marks
Driving on tracks like Dale Earnheart
Stay on the low like the earth spot
Put a big loss on your earn chart
Nice since the nurse signed my birth chart
Seldom seen but often heard, while your jams is barely heard
Just my name is a daily word
*From avenues to streets, terraces and park places
Stair wells, jail cells, penthouse to basements
Arrangement basic, but still fans chase it
Y2K can't delete the true ancient
Apache war drum on the ranges
Skill level dangerous
Arrow head that killed all the cavemen
They cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement
And get violated like a plaintiff
I ain't shit to play with
I give a Goddamn what your name is
Delete it and make it so it never get repeated

Loud and clear, bright and early
Listen...
(Verse 1: Mos Def)
I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock, way above the game
To be point blank with you motherfuck the game
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump and fake
But dog, Not to def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not to dude
I'm grown man business, and I am not in school
Put your hand down youngin' this is not for you
On my +J.O.+ with beats by Kan-ye yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh, like I'm still a day old
And it's been like that since the day yo
On more time than a Roley, or Seiko
Step on deck, your neck do what I say so
Get up or get out, get down or lay low

Cherokee red to shoot the long arrow
Got more skill, more aim, and more ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like, hail Mary, full of grace
Niggaz come in and shoot up the place
And make you pull up your face
The deck, I'm a pull out the ace
From the jungles of the empire state
Where it ain't no escape, 247, 718
And that's like every night, every day
From the place that I settle and stay
To the states, I'm collecting my pay
Blast off then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro ball not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised

Revolve around God, and involve with niggaz

And make Mos Def a classic modern figure

Your coming through clan, 'cause I'm right here wit'cha

Made it fresh without a brand new song

You ever felt ugly enough to cry?
Have you ever begged for mercy?
Have you ever wished you died?

Have you ever taken pride in the crime?
Been too hungry to break down or hide?
Felt low down dirty? Or super duper high?
Or contemplated murder, robbery, or suicide?
Tell the truth...
Taken medicine for trouble in your mind?
Or taken down a number? For taking up a scheme?
I made her wild, beautiful take her till she skeet?
Take her to the penthouse or take her to the skreet?

And every buggy on the block got the tune on blast
The TV is like the radio with visuals too
So shiny, so gutter, mean moody and cool
Tell the truth...
They might be doing things that you wanna' do
You fantasize as they be living it through
The big home with the beautiful view
You have a swim in the pool, and get fresh
And take a spin in the coupe
Tell the truth...
You probably want to feel the world in your palm
While hold a gun in your hand
And make 'em know you a star
Tell the truth...
And there's those who probably already are
They well known in they zone
Or they town or they block
Tell the truth...
Then there's the rest who are usually not
And the heavy dose of thug feel like all that they got

Can't believe it, this fucka' got me weeping
I keep it a secret so my friends won't peep it (live man?)

Translation: There is no god but Allah
When... all... is... said... and... done... there's... only... one
Cash and carry legendary Sagitarri (us) style's wary
And it's very necessary get it clearly
Never scary barely worried bright and early
Bald head straight or curly mundane other worldly
No chain now the jewelry that jackers can't snatch
The gingerbread the slave masters can't catch
Blat! Now put your minds on that
Get real or get back quit frontin and face facts
The old timers say we're living in the final days
Gun smoke young folks living any kind of way
Gangster holiday greedy snakes and hideaways
Meanwhile soldiers take it straight through their armor plates
Crash hit the market gates marvels of the modern age
Access is instant and treachery is commonplace
I sense the dangers and I'm not afraid
Because when all is said and done there's only ONE
Man up playboy playing the game boy
Pull back spectacular aim boy
Say what you say boy whoever could make noise
In wide range often the same voice
Conduct an arrangement with definite language
It's pure inspiration for these generations
Speak true free love [? ]
Because when all is said and done there's only ONE
And the one can done so cool
Schooling the young like Rev. Run (""whose house? "")
Quote Pac tell 'em keep they heads up
And when the pressure comes down press back and press up
Fret not ghetto world guess what
God is on your side the devil is a lie
The Empire holds all the gold and the guns
But when all is said and done there's only...

59,War,2004,The New Danger (2004),Hip Hop|Alternative Hip Hop|Political Hip Hop|East Coast Hip Hop,Mos Def,"War is a global economic phenomenon
Ain't a batch of guns on where, hellfire
Spittin', run up everything they hittin'
Some do they job to dodge the barrage
As sleek projectiles never stay bound
Fire bite invades the night with light
Loud, fighter planes shout shell rain
When they shot to kill cops on the terrain
And leave any brain that may remain stained
You god damn right this war goin' too far
Socialists think they converse with the stars
Wars found, my find the beauty in the stars
I level with death even beneath radar
I level with death even beneath radar
I level with death and she got pretty eyes
Nobody told me death was so damn fine
I go to sleep with that girl on my mind
Wake up in a sea, I wanna fire in line
Grab my heat, then it's get down time
One day I'ma make that girl all mine
But for now I'm a soldier abidin' my time
Writin' my rhyme behind enemy lines
Palestine, Kosovo, Cashmere
No different than the avenues right here
An increase in the murder rate each year
Paramilitary unit keep the streets clear
Curtains up on the theatre of warfare
Dramatic politics nightly preformed here
Worldwide from Colombia to Columbine
Don holders keep ya dollar signs on the line
""I don't want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone if possible
Jew, gentile, black man, white
We all want to help one another
Human beings are like that
We want to live by each other's happiness
Not by each other's misery
In this world, there's room for everyone
And the good earth is rich
And can provide for everyone a way of life""
Fuck that
You know the drill
Fix ya face
I'ma hustle off the hill
Go get my money man
Go get my money man
See every hunter need to kill
Go get my money man
I'm old school from off the hill
Go get my money man
Go get my money man
I give a fuck what I do
Go get my money man
Go get my money man
Go get that money man
Go get my money man
Go get that money man
Gimme my money man
Gimme my money
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Fuck you, pay me
Gimme the loot, Gimme the loot, Gimme the loot"

I'll give you all the diamonds and money
But you can't break my heart
Cause that'll just get you fired
And everybody needs a job
Work is scarce competition is fierce
Fonzi frontin in the new leather like they don't care
Word? Let's get you an award for that performance
Winner in the category for the best boring
Tell the tough guys we tougher than tough times
And needles in the nerves to make the tighten up unwind
One time, for locking out the light in your eyes
You're searching for your perfect one
Broken down from getting at all
To take it however it comes
Plain day you the specialist one
Oh me oh my!
I'll give you all the milk and the honey
But you can't break my heart
Cause that'll just get you fired
Sloppy worker get your pay grade bust
Work is scarce skilled working is rare
Fonzi fronting at the job site
Primping up they hair
Word? Well tell them only staff could drink they coffee
Walking papers hit the office
Sleep late tomorrow morning
Tell the tough guys we're tougher than tough times
And nerves don't snap when the clock touch crunch time
That's right we're tougher than tough times
From been narrow wind
To the clock just unwind
Fa sho we tougher than tough times
My proof don't need to lie

Lifting up the light in your eyes
You're gazing at your perfect one
Broken down from never at all
To better than you could ever want

Give it to 'em
Yes, yes, yes, yes, aha ah!
Ghetto people... this one's for you
And you and you and you
And you and you in the front
Yo!
Jack Johnson (aha) live and stompin
Undisputed heavy weights champ (aha) of the world
Yo I'm live with it, low, middle, the high with it
And that's how I'ma live and die with it
Hold up and down your spine with it
Like Zimzallabim, Jack Johnson, yes my dog, right with them!
The most special, most ghetto, most method, most valuable
Rep my avenue like is the damn state capital
Coming shadows to mind, a better mark of rapeness
On slaves who high jacked the slave ships
The hackers who remapped the matrix
And built the road back to basics
And getcha all off that strain shit
You know this other cats run game with, it's tainted
Consider this the moment that changed it: NOW!
Jack john's stand strong never bow down
Back off or get clapped dog right about POW
For east to the west, up north to down south
We show you how to REALLY make moshpit bounce
Show you how the gritty make the ghetto wild out
First letters that I wrote when I sketch the script down
I'm live with it
Low, middle, the high with it
And that's how I'ma live and die with it
I shine with it, rhyme with it, reveal and recognise with it
The ghetto know what time is it, when I spit it
Me 9-semi, an iron lion strike with it
See Dr. Know string a knot and make 'em ride with it
And look alive
Ghetto rock with me
Look alive
Ghetto rock with me
Aha yeah
Throw it up
Ghetto rock with me
Show it up
Ghetto rock with me
Born to rock, serve my portion hot
Rock the booze water on any bully on your block
My flow tighter than a big titties halter top
Doper than a floyd flake that they bought they pops
Since I bright a con duke of course I'm not
My sharp mind join the dots and blow they plots
A lot of cats talk noise a lot, but then the noise is stopped
When the heavy sound voice in charge
And this is no limp bizkit this is jack's fat cock
Loaded up slightly back, ghetto black rock
Brooklyn got bomb-rush that you can't stop
These the hungry hands that gon snatch your cash box
I never gave a second what on ""the fuck is with y'all?""
'Cause my first thought covered it all
You whack!
And I don't care what you sound since not mumblin y'all
Cause you can't do me nothing at all
Which means, you can't shine my shoes watch my drawers
Clean my cloth walk my dog moan my loan
On other words dude I don't need SHIT from them
All I got is hard rhymes and hot spit for them
And yeah, I got the country new (raaatttttt) for them
See how dark it can get for them?
Tell their mommas THAT'S IT for them
Get the flowers, they'll sing for them
A sad story how it'll end for them
That's what you get for not listenin' FIRE!
And a long rest in kumbayah
You stand strong you can't move higher
You move in ""how we all can move higher?""
Ready to roll like new tire
Well I can show you who the true lion
True power move quiet through the understandin of the science
We live with it, no middle, the high with it
And that's how we gon live and die with it
Now ride with it
Yeah, ghetto rock with me
Ghetto rock with me
Ghetto rock with me
Ghetto rock! Ghetto... MOTHERFUCKERS!
Freaky radio!"
