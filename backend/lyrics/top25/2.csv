0,1970 Somethin',2005,Duets: The Final Chapter (2005),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"(B.I.G.)
1970 Somethin' nigga I don't sweat the date my moms was late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world the fly girls, tangeray and hennesey
Until I call earl, 10 months in this gut, wut the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild
Juvenile with the mics 'n' shit, New York New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st 2:19 was when my moma water burst
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilicle cords wrapped around my neck
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out I'm bringin' mad joy
The docter looked and said he's gonna be BAD BOY
(Faith Evans)
I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(The Game)
Would pac be alive, if you let pac drive
Swear to god to reverse it I give my left eye
With the right I visualized, the king of bed-stuy
Checkin' his daughter tianna into junior high
If I was in brooklyn, and B.I. was still alive, in 2006 it might sound like this
N.Y. 7-1-8 2-1-2, with sues rendevouz
It's like moulin rouge
High fashion, up town air force ones
And vasquez, puerto ricans with fat asses
Blaze dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S classes
For you bastards, catch a cab to manhattan
With that broadway actin', u hype that belly shit
Would you get you capped, and wrapped in plastic
Tell the captain, S Roge was happennin'
Out here nor speak no evil, inside the magnum
(Faith Evans)
I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time
(B.I.G.)
Now I'm 13 smokin' blunts, makin' green
On the drug scene, fuck the football team
Risk it, rupt ur spleens, by the age of 16
Hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my doe up
So school I didn't show up, and fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! I couldn't see it
Scarface king of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got encarcerated, kinda scary
See 74' march 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn were did I fail
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail
(Faith Evans)
I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere"
1,Another,1997,Life After Death (1997),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"(Big) Yeah... fuck you
(Kim) Fuck you too!
(Big) Fuck you bitch
(Kim) Fuck you motherfucker
(Big) You ain't shit anyway, fuck you
(Kim) You ain't shit, you fat motherfucker
(Big) Yeah, whatever whatever
(Kim) Whatevah
(Big) You wasn't sayin' that when you was suckin my dick
(Kim) You wasn't sayin' that when you was eatin my pussy!
(Kim) You a nasty motherfucker!
(Big) Check it, uh
(Kim) Crab ass
(Chorus One: B.I.G.)
What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue?
You cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life
(Notorious B.I.G.)
Uh-huh, uh, uh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin', took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you would do the right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boom coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, ""Sittin' in My Room""
Pissy drunk listenin to the Stylistic tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin' 'bout the old days
My nigga's like, ""Fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, did she beep you? Don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
You'll be all fuckin' tonight""
(Chorus Two: Lil' Kim)
What do ya do when your man is untrue?
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?
I need another man, in my life
(Lil' Kim)
Mmm, uh, uh!
Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all; shoulda seen the hoe
Nigga pack ya shit, you out the do', oh
What about the fight in the Mirage?
I seen ya Benz, parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was ya friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures
Scalin fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin ya heat in the passenger seat
Of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary-eyed, damn a bitch schemin
Girls steady screamin, ""Kim you need to leave him!""
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin' 'bout the bitches I fought
Over you, you can have the shit you bought
And fuck you, using is my last resort
You see nine outta ten niggaz, ain't shit
One outta five niggaz suck a dick
Ya mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canapé
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked ya dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uh, why go from first class to coach?

Junior M.A.F.I.A., uh, um
(I like this) Yeah
Nine-four
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies?
The back of the club sipping Moët is where you'll find me
The back of the club, macking hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question asking, blunt passing, music blasting, but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep wit'
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fucking players
Jump in the Rover and come over, tell your friends jump in the GS3
I got the chronic by the tree
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
To the honies getting money playing niggas like dummies
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
If you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (Why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby, baby
Straight up honey really I'm asking
Most of these niggas think they be macking, but they be acting
Who they attracting with that line, ""What's your name, what's your sign?""
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo? (True)
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the Jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
To the honies getting money playing niggas like dummies
(I love it when you call me big poppa)
If you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (Why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby, baby
(How you living, Biggie Smalls?) In mansion and Benzes
Givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream, fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote Gats strapped with infrared beams
Chopping O's, smoking la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend
Honey, check it
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?
Is that aight with you?
Yeah, keep bangin'

Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player

If you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (Why?)

The best that ever lived it
Cocksuckers, What's his name, huh?
That's how we do it y'all
To all my niggaz in the house
Bad Boy, Who we die for
All day, everyday nigga
For the love of BIG, we bang out
Since my man died, we don't hang out
We blow brains out, we tear the club up pullin things out
Mafia World, all my niggaz max out
We Bad Boys, why y'all niggaz cracked out
Coward niggaz, most are buried down south
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies
Niggaz bearly speak when we discuss money
Niggaz stay yappin when there's always somethin' funny
The realest niggaz never took nothin' from me
Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggaz that got drunk, and hate kids
Got niggaz on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix
A yo, Biggie taught me well, Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheel
Chorus: Lil' Cease and Notorious B.I.G.
(Lil' Cease)
To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name...
I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for...
Mafia
(Notorious B.I.G.)
Representin Bucktown
Mack 11's cocked back, niggaz better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earings, you know the drama Biggie bring
For BIG I learn to grip aim and cock it
Once I got it, I lock it
Banger, big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antartic
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hit
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spread things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga ill's holdin' it down for the beam
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name
For BIG I grip the cig, put six in your wig
Not cause of what he said, cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and that's the way it is for...
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jokes with police scanners, niggaz mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggaz that wear bandanas and rep...
We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel
B.K. style, see BIG howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world
Niggaz nothin' but squirels, they know we rep...
Niggaz tryin' to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut
Wood style roll'em up, get plucked, nigga what
Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths
Know my gat and bust for my nigga...
(Lil' Kim)
Now when I cock back and squeeze, my Desert E'z
Make you drop to your knees, barly able to breathe
My bullets move in threes, one for Brook-lyn
One for Mafia so take that, Uh, and this one's for...
You know Frank kept me iced out
Mink dragon, seven figures in my bank account
All that material shit, y'all still tryin' to get it
Uh, you fuckin' pricks, get off his dick tryin' to be like...
All y'all lame ass niggas keep my man name out your mouth
Or get this shit right, check it, it's the B-I, double G-I, E
Y'all niggaz can't see Poppa, nor the Big Moma
Who you love... for the Y2G, the two ten
We got it sewn, we don't need y'all help, we hold our own
Cause this goes out to cats not tryin' to give it up
BIG missin' us, shout him out...

Except how I'm gettin' home, tomorrow
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O., uh
Back of my mind I hope she swallow (uh-huh)
Mad She split a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryin' to wait
Conversate, sex on the first date I state
She starts, 
Then I, whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South, aoowww
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans skirt butt-naked it all work
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
I remember we
Went to Tennessee
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Symone
Screamin, she feenin, for the semen
Me bein, the man that I am
Took it to her condo, pronto
Half Indian, called her Tonto
Roll the kronk ton in the dark pronto
Few buzz, I got load
And off to the bedroom we go (mmmmmm)
Sex is drama, head to trauma
Rip pajamas I'ma stay to tomorrow
Satisfyin all my needs twice
With the whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggaz on, what, what?
Ladies, my Mercedes
Hold fo' in the back, two if it's fat
Keep a gat, cause cats, try to test me
They just fans like DeNiro, Wesley
Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin on
Gaudy years teens look like they painted on
Ask thee, leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently
She like the way the dope fold up, Rolls roll up
Cristal just throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's DeGenero
Dripped out, iceberg Capero
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Intro goes without speaking
Call me Cease 'cause I keep em,
We can go freaking
All weekend, so, roll in
Ain't it good that my Lex
Keeps folding? Unnh
To all you bitches wanna fuck with me
Freakin you bitches like Jodeci

Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo

It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nuttin to do
Uh, I'm intrrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfuckin thing
""Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?""
Yo who dis? ""Taisha"" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don'tcha hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dopefiend, crackfiend, eyewitness news team

I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sittin' all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with
Chorus One: Biggie Smalls

Huh, first of all you got me mixed up with

And it wouldn't take a second 'fore I had her on her back

Pull up my pants and diss you
And hit the door you came through
Its Cease-a-Lee, a.k.a. Mista Nasty
Germany style, these hoes they blast me
One of the chickenhead with sex appeal pass me
That's her hands, ankles, feet they ashy
I like the flashy type, who pass with dykes
With long hair, and they ass be right
I get up on that ass, see what that be like
I fuck a bitch good, if she ask me right, huh

The motherfucker there wasn't nuttin stoppin' him

Let's go deep into the phrase, beautiful sunrays
Off the baldhead, everything is real

Watch it Slim, hey Dad, place yo' bet on seven
Peace to one-oh-six, one-oh-eight, one-to-the-hundred-eleventh
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With 22's in your shoes, yo keep the shank ready
(Notorious B.I.G.)
Uh well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat
Release the BRAINSTORM, to make your motherfuckin BRAIN WARM
A strange form, somethin' kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well ""In God We Trust"", guns I bust
Got that disgustin, sewer style dumpin
And that uh {*singin*} do you knowwwwww, where you're goin' to
Do you like the things that I bring?
{*Rappin*} Make an emcee wanna sing for a livin'
Take the beatdown we fuckin' givin', c'mon motherfucker
(Sadat X)
What? Niggaz want drama, puttin' work on my block
When I told y'all last week, that shit was too hot
Sellin pieces and treys, cuts my dimes
Somebody gon' get paid, somebody block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as y'all run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo Biggie tell these niggaz I'ma hit 'em where it hurts
The big city it don't spare no bodies
Call me papichulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or fo' stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey yo money that's yo' stock, yo Bigs pass the glock
I'ma tell him it can happen, don't play me with that rap shit
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel

Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's, the shits never end
You can't touch my riches

Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot glocks
HAH, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the landspread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give emcees the runs drippin;
When I throw my clip in the A.K., I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable
Peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the llello
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jailcells
Oh my God I'm droppin' shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
'Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fuckin' shit spill
And I'm talkin' bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
'Cause I got mo' shots to pop-ya
Big Pop-pa, breakin you off somethin' proper
Signin off is the hardcore rap singer

Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted
Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your shit it, just ain't got that LOUD
Gold tooth shine like TA-DOW!
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, frays raise your eyebrow
By now you figure, he talkin' bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead led to dumpin
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jokes turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches (HAH)
Missed you by pinches (HOO) your talk is senseless (RRUFF)
Actor needs chiropractor (HAH, HOO) for cracked jaw
Yes I rocked your cheddar box (hah)

C'mon, yo, throw your hands c'mon

Let's blow the club, c'mon
Fuck the place up, c'mon

Uh-huh, make money hand over fist
The bo-vines roam where chickenhearts don't exist
Settin up shop, it's hands on in the hustle
Fakes don't kill nuttin but time and don't tussle
The process of elimination, fresh rotation
Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory
The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand
Everything you can imagine is real man
And revenge be the dish I serve to cats cold
Stay up on about ten folds, you know how it goes
You know the streets and it's real as shit, c'mon
Niggaz grab your dicks, c'mon
Bitches rub your tits, c'mon

Slap you with my paw, all across your jaw
Break fool on these bitches while I'm breakin the law

Follow me, I slip 'em slide 'em rip 'em ride 'em provide em
With that West coast G shit, L.B.C. shit
We dips to this, make chips to this
And buy brand new whips and shit, uh-huh (beyotch)
I bet you didn't know that yo' bitch was suckin dick (say what?)
Who you think she fuckin' with? (what?) Look here

Point a pistol at you bitch niggas, BLA-DOW

Won't believe this voodoo
Can yo' pussy be chaka, don't let me speak in pat-ois
And kick you in your face like we playin' a game of soc-cer
I love to cock the glock-a, stack up on loot and vod-ka
And fuck your crew because all of y'all niggaz full of ca-ca
The way we doin' damage tell me how the FUCK you manage

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace... smack the bitch in the face;
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, ""The Vapors""
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} niggaz need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins till amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was ""Humpin Around"" and ""Jump-in Around""
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, ""B-I-G""
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)
(Notorious B.I.G.)
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that... (no question)
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya till you're gushy, so please don't push... me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?
(Eminem)
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin: horse's heads,
Human sacrifices, cannibalism; candles and exorcism
Animals having sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fucking, meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lying, I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dying to cock him
Who's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, red on the third;
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong

15,Everyday Struggle,1994,Ready to Die (1994),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin' so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
I don't wanna live no mo'

Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble;
In the everyday struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'

Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front do'
I'm livin' everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
Another day, another struggle
I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge I'ma mold 'er now
Trick a little dough buyin young girls fringes
Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein syringes
In the veins; hard to explain, how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin line
I had the first and the third; rehearse that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no! Even though they had me scared
Yo they got a eight, I gotta teck with air holes...
And that's just how the shit go in the struggle motherfucker
Hah... c'mon... what you say?

'Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend bitch
And you know that ain't right
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
(Yeah we know, drop the scenario)
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-Tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit
Look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
Uh, now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her 'cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine
You know that ain't right with a friend of mine"

19,Get Your Grind On,2005,Duets: The Final Chapter (2005),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"But I would've loved to hear
A Big Pun and B.I.G. collabo
That shit would've been incredible
(Big Pun talking)
Aye yaknahmsayin, it was just happen
We have our day, you know?
I seen him, I seen him, I seen him at the pearly gates, yaknahmean?
We keep it, keep it, keep it going from there
(Notorious B.I.G.)
Uh, I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set up
Shoulda pushed 'em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Uh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin BASTARD
Cryin, know my friends is lyin'
Y'all know who killed 'em filled 'em with the lugars from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin' ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apoligies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still
(Chorus: Freeway)
Nigga still gotta get his grind on
Come get introduced to my home
I grew up in the crime zone
Soon as you grown, you on your own, you keep your strap
You keep your chrome cause the streets is chilly
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my home
A nigga grew up in the pro-jects, end up gettin' mo' stressed
Mo' money, mo' drama you know a nigga keep his armor
Cause the streets are killin'
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my home
(Big Punisher)
Yo, yo
The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me till I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
And rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggaz talk but they babble 'cause they ain't sayin' nuttin
If ain't blazin' somethin' with the mac I'm in the shack bakin muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin; my Squad been waitin
For the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin
An orgi-nation of veterans built
With genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills
Invest in the real, don't get left in the hills
My tech and my steel turn your whole crew into vega-ta-bills
We blessed with the will to never surrender
Cause my every agenda's in and out, unseen like I entered the ninja
It's my world
(Fat Joe)
I got that new F-N, call it that faggot nigga gun
Couple of hollow tips make you faggot niggaz run
Crack pull up, everybody clear out
Anybody pumpin that rock is gettin' aired out
I'm in that caddy with my bitch in the pack
Your mommy got a body but she itchin to clap
And I know you pitchin purple but we switchin the packs
Listen, don't make me hurt you I'm just givin' the facts
On that I 9-5 swirvin to a town near you
My niggaz watch out for that Black Surburbans
And no it's not the Feds, man papi's home
And papi got it good, he could put you on
Listen, I done made abandoned blocks look hot
Nine to ten Benzes, a couple of drops
Couple of rubber bands from the corrupt cops
Just to see my niggaz eat and shit and huggin the blocks
Crack a chestize 'em, right besides 'em
In front of a hundred million viewers, shouldn't surprise 'em
We from the Bronx where the may-ors lift up
And niggaz get shot in broad day 'cause we don't give a...
Fuck little niggaz on bike and just shoot you
All for a pair of some Nikes, the shits brutal
I done seen fiends O.D., shot the wrong pack
Then they call the shit the bomb smack
Word to Crack, the god body, the hard body, the realest ever
The John Gotti, this rap shit, will it kill me? Never

This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team-and
Be Mor-gan than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces
Fuck the screwfaces, 'cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggaz can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly (what)
To old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what) specialize
In killin' wives and grandmothers, who ya trustin, shit
When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin' ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin' broads home
On the phone with the chip, with these Cristal chicks
Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit"

Motherfuckers better know
Heh, heh (I'm a bad bad bad)
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls
Huh, yeah
(I'm a bad bad bad)
My man Inf left a Tec and a nine at my crib
Turned his self in, he had to do a bid
A one to three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G: you with me?
Motherfucking right, my pockets looking kinda tight
And I'm stressed, yo, Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat, the Tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'mma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (What?)
Treat it like boxing, stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbing motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same .45
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing, it's so hard
Yes love, love your fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy, that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and the #1 mom pendant
I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
'Cause mom dukes ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that, and a dime sack, where the paper at?
When he's sticking you and taking all of your money
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sending Mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
'Cause when I lick shots, them shits is persistent
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? Nigga pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug
.357 slug and my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckas better strip, yeah nigga, peel
Before you find out how blue steel feel
From the Beretta, putting all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckas don't know better
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckas can't stop it
Man niggas come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her doorknockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka
(So go get your man bitch, he can get robbed too)
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
(Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it)
(Hey bitch, hey bitch, gimme your money bitch)
When he's sticking you and taking all your money
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad bad bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
Man listen, all this walking is hurting my feet
Ooh money looks sweet
(Where?) In the Isuzu jeep
Man, I'll throw him in the beam, you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar
(Ooh Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat)
Yo chill shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot
(Oh shit the cops)
Be cool, fool, they ain't gonna roll up
All they want is fucking doughnuts
So why the fuck he keep looking?
I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass 'cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots 'cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot
Take that motherfuckers"

Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.
When the lala hits ya lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that ya hat can't fit ya
Either I'm witcha or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
Talkin' to the rap inventor
Nigga wit the game tight, Bic that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, Double-G, I-E
Iced out lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Gettin' head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women, and the weed -- sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the Hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad 'cause I got my dick sucked
And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
It's the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Recognize a real Don when you see Juan/one
Sippin on booze in the House of Blues
Chorus: repeat 4X
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali
Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.
If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breasts in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggaz is a mess
Thinkin' I'm gon stop, givin' L.A. props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
People start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G.
Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's
If I wanna squirt her, take her to Fatburger
Spend about a week on Venice Beach
Sippin Crist-o, with some freaks from Frisco
Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G.
Cali got gunplay, models on the runway
Scream Biggie Biggie gimme One More Chance
I be whippin on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light, I'm set tonight
Paid a visit to Versace stores
Bet she suck until I ain't got no more, only in L.A.
Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck yo' man
Fuck your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State?
Almost gold, 5 G's at show gate
Or do you wanna see about seven digits
Fuck hoes exquisite, Cali, great place to visit
Chorus: again to fade"

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
(Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.)
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to *hell*
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion
(Chrous: Bob Marley)
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
(Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.)
I swear to God I just want to *slit* my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm *dead*, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe *suicide's* on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
(Chorus: Bob Marley)
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
(Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.)
I reach my peak, I can't speak,
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' (*echoes*)"
23,Hope You Niggas Sleep,1999,Born Again (1999),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"(Biggie)
Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts
Yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits
No time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes I thought you know I'm smooth as a babies ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn born Teflon don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah y'all a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in they drawers
For the burner, catch a body
I got styles like karate
Jujitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe
Hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self, from Brooklyn, where else
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I'll rip your troop
Not even Lois Lnae could get the scoop
What you think I'm stupid
My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep
(B.G.)
I throw a bomb through you window
Burn you up and your hoe
I catch your mama going to therapy
And cut her throat
You lil' sister walking home from school
I abduct her, then I fuck her
I hit ya park close up with the Louisville Slugger
BGeezy is the hustla, ignorant motherfucker
I was taught how to bust heads by the best head busters
Cluckers, you know I got'em 2 for 1 my nigga
I'm on V.L. if you want me, get some my nigga, come on
(Big Tymer)
Thuggin' is my thing, if I'm beefing I'm banginhg
Slanging, it's in my nature, gotta be about my paper
Haters, I don't like'em, bitches, I don't trust'em
Niggas, I can't stand'em, I creep down and pluck'em
Strap say in my hand, I gotta protect mine
Niggas trying to pull it off, pop goes the nine
That's how it gotta be in these uptown streets
And a nigga like me, I play the game for keep
(Juvenile)
I remember when niggaz slang heroin up in balloons
I paid attention to everything, from killings to cartoons
Got a picture of Malcolm X on the wall in my room Bitch
On some ol' nigga fuck wit me I'ma do 'em shit
Nigga give me dope, I accept it, but don't respect him
Put my foot in they rectum right after I dome check 'em
I be popping D, smoking weed, and full of that Hennesey
Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gone mention me
I been out doing it for years, since elementary
Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consist of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit 'cause I don't fuck with scrubs
I don't need you harassing me when I'm up in the club
Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub

Innocent people move 'cause somebody fix'n to get split

Find a deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Television's, Versacci heaven, when I'm up in em

Nigga tricked ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressin me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playin' gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112, CD blast, I was past

Then I heard her moan, ""honey I'm home!""
Yep, tote chrome for situations like this

Now I'm like bitch you better talk to him
Before this fist put a spark to him
Fuck around shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him, arm, leg
She beggin me to stop but this cat gettin' closer
Gettin' hot like a toaster, I cocks the toast, uh
Before my eyes could blink

He go back downstairs more time to think
Her brain racin, she's tellin' me to stay patient
She don't know I'm, cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will doe, I probably chill doe
Even though situation lookin' kinda ill yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga comin' off some love potion shit
Flash the heat on em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, ""Don't blast here's the stash,
A hundred cash just don't shoot my ass, please!""
Nigga pullin mad G's out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggaz on the cell
Bring some weed I got a story to tell, uh...

Must have been rained out or something *laughing* because he's in the
Spot. Had me scared, had me scared, I was shook Daddy - but I forget I
Had my Roscoe on me. Always. You know how we do. So anyway the nigga
Comes up the stairs, he creepin' up the steps, the bitch all shook she
Sends the nigga back downstairs to get some drinks and shit. She gettin'
Mad nervous, I said fuck that man! I'm the nigga, you know how we do it
Nigga, ransom note style put the scarf around my motherfuckin face,
Gagged that bitch up, played the kizzack. Soon this nigga comes up in
The spot, flash the Desert in his face he drops the glass. Looked like
The nigga pissed on his-self or somethin', word to mother! Ah fuckit

Mad papers, mad papers. (I told you that bitch was a shiesty bitch 'cause!
Word to mother I used to fuck her cousin but you ain't know that! Hahaha.
You wouldn't know that shit. Really though.) I threw all that

Hah, how real is this?
Uh, uh, how real is this?
What? uh, what?
Uh
Verse one jay z:
We push the hottest v's, peel fast
Through the city, play monopoly with real cash
Me and biggie and the models be shaking they sadiddy ass
And prada be, somethin' you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Bein broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and paisan
Scope the spot out, see somethin' nice and I'm gone
You cats is home, screamin the fights on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin ty-son
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playin' right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
At any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it? now make dollars
Cats pop bottles bone chicks that favor Idalis
And rack up frequent flight mileage
Chorus: angela winbush
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
Verse two: notorious b.i.g.
I'm poppin' magnums while jigga bag somethin'
Watch is platinum, got jet lag from
Flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes
Make the best c.d.'s and the best tapes
Don't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals
Biggie be richie like lionel, shit
You seen the Jesus, dipped to h classes
Ice project off lights, chick flashes
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in big mustaches
Rock top fashions
Ain't shit changed, except the number after the dot
On the range, way niggaz look at me now, kinda strange
I hate y'all too
Rather be in Caribbean sounds with rachel
It's unreal, out the blue frank white got sex appeal
Bitches used to go, ""ewww!""
Still tote steel, tryin' to see five mil
Off the sin-gle, for real
You ain't fazin the amazin
While your guns raisin, mine is blazin'
See you on see me all talkin' to sweetness
Take it for weakness and leave quick
Blocka, roc-a-fella, bad boy collabo
Two MC's with mad dough, junior uh (junior mafia)
Chorus: angela winbush
I love the dough, more than you know'
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
Verse three: jay z and notorious b.i.g.
Miracu-lous, pockets stay full
Niggas skip the bull 'cause we matadors
Snatch the p-89's that we pack in the drawers
And we, clap doors in your acuras
Snap like, cameras on amateurs
Make you all dance, hold the hammer to yours
Jig and big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
Everybody got a part to play, back to yours
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
Play the charts like the beatles, y'all adapt you lost
And toast cristal on behalf y'all
Too bad for y'all, ain't too many as bad as yours
Truly, do we, we laugh at y'all
Little bastards y'all
Uh, uh
We hit makers with acres
Roll shakers in vegas, you can't break us
Lost chips on lakers, gassed off shaq
Country house, tennis courts and horseback
Ridin' decidin crack crab or lobster?
Who say mobsters don't prosper
Niggaz is actors, niggaz deserve oscars
Me I'm, critically acclaimed, slug past your brain
Reminisce on dames who, coochie used to stink
When we rocked house pieces and puffy gucci links
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
Tito smile every time he see our faces
Cases catch more than outfield-ers
Half these rappin' cats, ain't seen war
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame
Speak my name, I make 'em dash like dame
Chorus: angela winbush
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey

Woo! There's gonna be a lot of punchin in this motherfucker
Y'all better be swift with that punch button Jack
Biggie... Biggie...
(Notorious B.I.G.)
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin' so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
Chorus: K-Ci and JoJo
Come and run with me ... I really wanna show you
How I run the streets ... I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin G's ... I really wanna show you
Come and run with me ... I really wanna show you
(Notorious B.I.G.)
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble;
In the everyday struggle
(Notorious B.I.G.)
I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
(Nas)
Guns and diamonds
Bitches put they tongues where the sun ain't shinin
Take ki's till they spot us, snakes flee with consignment
This kid he got his krib rated, police found grams
They locked up, his whole fam; moms sister his old man
Nigga bailed his moms out, then he told on his man
Now they home, actin' like nuttin wrong, hustlin again
He tried to be the next Frank White, and Escobar
Pickin' up coke a fiend holds it in a separate car
Cooks it up till it's bright white, cut it tight right
Then he slings it to the fiends, lookin' like Fright Night
Coppin the motorbikes, the scooters, countin' dough on computers
High technology dealers, to the users and losers
Half-leg DiDi, try to swap drug for TV's
Stores run out of baking soda from BK to QB
My niggaz die for the cause, .45 on the drawer
City laws made by Big Nas and Biggie Smalls
Bitches, holdin' my weight in they titties and drawers
My bitches out of state get bust while they pushin my cars
Callin me up, callin me baller, call for they cut
Pretty hoes bring me my cash, swallow all of this nut
Seats on the Bent' stay nasty, push the dash
For the stash box is where the cash be; watchin for task force
'Cause I know they comin' but I'm reachin' my goal
Fuck bummin, I'm makin' sure I leave this whole game wit somethin'
Crib in West Palms for my dime, crib for my moms
Ridiculous, you lookin' at the next Nicholas Barnes, baby

Did it with the glocks, spit it witcha pops, you was in diapers

Doin' it the O.G. way; it's sorta like
The Brooklyn Way, it's just the crook in me
So this is dedicated to the memory of
The Notorious One, the glorious one
And if you go for your gun, I got to go for mine
Cock my nine, and separate yo' head from yo' spine
So, ""Grab yo' dicks if you love hip-hop"" and

Of the young black male in this black hell

Ih... ih, ih (it has been)
It has been, it has been, it has been
It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead {what?}
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money power respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself goin' out as a hero {uh}
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many Biggie backed off of {ha ha ha}
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
To see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest {uh-huh}
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it
(Obie Trice + {B.I.G.})
Since B.I.B. taught us niggaz to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious {what?}
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencin the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin', goin' through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life {yeah}
Palmin that forty-five, plottin to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh? {uh-huh}
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I.
(Diddy + {B.I.G.})
I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passin {what?}
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace...
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother...
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back {yeah}
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin' ""God bless""
Regardless to critics yellin' that East/West
I seen the game losin, I'm just pressin the reset {uh}
And when the resurrection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally!
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga!"
33,Juicy,1994,Ready to Die (1994),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"Fuck all y'all, hoes
Get a grip motherfucker
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothing
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustling in front of
That called the police on me
When I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm saying
It's all good baby baby
It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock till my tape popped
Smoking weed and Bambu, sipping on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup)
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right)
It's all good (it's all good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alizé keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Putting 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh... and if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more public housing
Thinking back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all
(It's all good)
...And if you don't know, now you know, nigga"
34,Just Playing (Dreams),1994,Ready to Die (1994),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"As I sit back relax
Puff a blunt/sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail
For fuckin' Patti Labelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly
Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a miniute what about my honey Mary
The jeans they fittin like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses
Ima show ya who the boss of intercourse is
Sex I'm takin' no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. wit telepathy
The recipe of picture hardcore wit a gun
Pimpin' ain't easy but it's always fun
When I bust my nut
I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun
Chorus (repeat *4)
Dreams of fuckin' an R&B bitch
I'm jus playin/know what I'm sayin'
I'll put Chante Moore pussy in stitches
I'll fuck Rupaul...
Before I fuck them ugly ass X-scape bitches
You can 76 the 69... try 68
Did Raven Simone called date rape
Only 'cause I'm paid/I'm fuckin' all of Jade
And my DJ Zhane she likes it when they say
Everybody... move your body
Got Whitney Houson boostin from Bobby
As I bus your cherry yo face lookin' scarry
Backshots to Chaka... I know that pussy hairry
Sade... ooh I know that pussy tight
Spiked Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike
Smoke the bones/me gettin' them red

Let's go
(Biggie)
Niggaz in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all
Big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)
I spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)
You're nobody till somebody kills you (I don't wanna die)
(Biggie) (chorus)
Do you know where your going too
Just a memory... everybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK
May you rest in peace
Your nobody till somebody kills you
Do you know where your goin' too
Just a memory... so you better pack a pistol
Everybody dying, death controls y'all
Your nobody till somebody kills you
(Pusha T)
Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows
My back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk
Spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggaz, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamour that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)
On the flipside, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing
(Malice)
Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was laudering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She damn near sent me to my room
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uh
(Diddy)
Biggie Duets...
Born Again...

Welcome back. *audience applauds*

And I've been conversing with the Mad Rapper.
And quite frankly -- he's very mad.

*Mad Rapper fades out*
(Spoken intro ends)
(Cut and scratched ""I gots to talk. I gotta tell what I feel.
I gotta talk about my life as I see it!"")
Intro: repeat 2X ('Biggie' repeats every line of beat)
This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you, and you
Verse One:
Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon Don-Dadda, fuck Poppa
You got ta, call me, Francis M.H. White
In tank-light totes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low, and keep firin
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip, on that cat with that grip on rap
The mo shady, ""Tell em!"", Frankie baby
Ain't no tellin' where I may be
May see me in D.C. at Howard Homecomin
With my man Capone, dumbin, fuckin' somethin'
You should know my steelo
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen befo'
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious
Penis, before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better get, who sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than Great Adventure
Biggie, ""How are you gonna do it?""
Chorus: repeat 4X
Kick in the door, wavin the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Verse Two:
On ya mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get, when ya marked with death
Should I start your breath should I let you die
In fear you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically, I'm worser, don't front the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I punish em, I'm done with them
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got cum in them, 'cause they, nothin' but dicks
Tryin' to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro rock diamonds, that's sick
Got pay off my flow, rhyme with my own click
Take trips to Cairo, layin with yo bitch
I know you prayin' you was rich, fuckin' prick
When I see ya I'ma
Verse Three:
This goes out for those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on the King of NY
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
Now ya Braille in it, stash that light shit, or scalin it
Conscience of ya nonsense in eighty-eight
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson
Tote steel like Bronson, vigilante
You wanna get on son, you need to ask me
Ain't no other king in this rap thing
They siblings, nothing but my chil'ren
One shot, they disappearin
Its ill when, MC's used to be on cruddy shit
Took home, Ready to Die, listened, studied shit
Now they on some money shit, successful out the blue
They light weight, fragilly, my nine milly
Make the white shake, that's why my money never funny
And you still recoupin, stupid *echoes*"
37,Last Day,1997,Life After Death (1997),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"Intro/Chorus: The Lox
Can I live till my last day
Hittin honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
(The Sheek)
Yo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The Lox get
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit
Lox and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, see Luciano put the burners
To all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'all
(Jadakiss)
You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a French kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kicked the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam the flow is forbidd-en
Either you ridin' or you dyin' 'cause we swingin' iron
Lox and Poppa, turning niggaz into Jim Hoffa
Who gon stop us, it's your last joint double copper
You gettin' money or your runnin' from the Feds
Ain't nothin' over here but sixteen and one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggaz out there got a problem this year
Chorus: repeat 2X
(Styles-P)
Before you think of keepin' me down, heatin me down
The flow like water get deepe and you drown
With no soul, many niggaz roll with no dough
Even the small Dunn got a little black hole
Your destiny is somethin' you can never figure out
Niggaz is never happy till there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to play in this?
A lot are dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it got money you better get with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes divides, when dreams collide
Teams provide, war for the street to absorb
Stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind dove'll fall in love with a whore
(Notorious B.I.G.)
Uh, uh, uh
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert Ease make MC's freeze
You wakin' up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
Realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
I be the mob fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
My first LP, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
Collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin' promos
Break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shined to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need for mo'
Chorus: repeat till fade"

Shit, one for shelter, book flights on Delta
Live on your station, the radiation'll melt ya
Cool - I guess your momma raised a fool
You didn't wanna blaze your tool shoulda stayed in school
Rap terror, shots through your new era
Get it together, y'all niggaz shoulda knew better
I'm on point like acupuncture
I might, track and hunt ya, smack and punch ya
Left side, right side, witcha hoe I might slide
Runnin' wit this big guy, y'all niggaz is pranksters

A broad gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug
So when he lit shots
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the Mac .11's swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain
I'm livin' in a house of pain
(Chorus: Mary J. Blige)
Is anybody listenin and tell me can you can see this God be surroundin me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin' hard to breathe
And it's gettin' blury, I'm gettin' worried 'cause it's gettin' hard to see
When your living in the house of paaaiiinnn
(2Pac)
When the motherfucker dust kicker, who can you trust?
Who gave you the heart to see a nigga?
Before you bust, my name is spoken on the tongue so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the blocks and I ain't even go
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame
From doin' fix to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock niggaz on my block
Jealous ass suckers got it duckin for my fuckin' glock
And bustin' niggaz ass is to stay alive
Skinny ass playa watchin victim motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin' how I'm a hustler?
Buckin busters till they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggaz got they AK's headin for the bird
Aimin at free ass bitches let 'em rain
Givin' 'em, wettin 'em, welcome to the house of pain
(Chorus: Mary J. Blige)
(Nas)
MJB, be worried niggaz, yeah, Nas...
Wendy Williams say I stayed dust maybe I should
'Cause these rappers'll have your phone tap like Savion Glover
And on the West the police corrupt, some are bloods
But these Teflon I loaded explodin some mugs
I'm like Furious in ""Boyz In the Hood""
But at the drive through I'm ain't runnin' I'm dumpin
Crazy like a paru and load up, know how Nas do
I'm callin Henchmen to save shit, to organize a black truth
And we party hard party wit Nas
Since they ain't no more - Mardi Gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize
Y'all yellin' my name but y'all soon die in
Tryin' to portray real but they be ly-in
'Cause they want the real niggaz to die so they can game
But neva that, this ain't neva lastin this is the house of pain

To my motherfuckin' man, fifty grand, the alcoholic man
Inject a tall can to his blood stream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
MC provoker, the chocolate tah smoker (huh?)
I like to mack in Maximas and Acuras
But cheeks, I'm smackin' em' (huh?)
The raw rapper, spot smacker
Wit the lil hooker on my lap-ah, you know your favorite macker
A shy nigga, but I ain't ya fuckin' comforter
And If I ever fall in love, I better fuck it up
Ask the hooker, If I didn't jug her
She try to front, then I put the Chucky Booker on her
(Why you wanna... play games on me?)
Bitch, you crazy? Commitments, I'm Swayze
No time for the ill shit
Mess with the niggaz on that real blood spill shit
My rappin' tactics, are drastic
Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my Pedigree, you better be
Filled with energy, niggaz never gettin' me
(Chorus 2X: Bobby Valentino and Cheri Dennis) + (Ludacris ab-libbing)
Big cities and bright lights
Short days and long nights
No stress and no strife
I'm high off living the life
(Ludacris)
It's clear to see that I'm the motherfuckin' man, I done learned from the
Best of em; Took the first slot, niggaz still second guessin' em
Hoes, I'm undressin' em', foes, I'm not stresin' em'
Outlastin' a bunch of 'em, outflowed the rest of em'
'Cause everyday, I stay preachin' on the pulpit
So tell them haters they could miss me with that bullshit
But I won't miss, I'm Luda, the heat holder
I'm rich, bitch! I've done more shows than Hova
And I'm a soldier, ready for whatever
Roll with a bunch of niggaz that don't know no better
King like Coreddar, countin' mo' cheddar
Just hired two dykes to be my ho getters
When it comes to these women, dog, ain't no one fuckin' wit me
They runnin' back, you think I had TJ Duckett wit me
That's 'cause I throw it like Vick, from the yard line
Menage a trois, it's safe to say I'm havin' hard times
(Chorus) + (Ludacris ab-libbing)
(Snoop Dogg)
To my nigga Chopper dot, with the whoopty-whop on the block
Got the heaters cocked, 'cause I know the suckers on the block
Hennesey and Belve-D, brings a lot of jealousy
Nigga stop snitchin', nephew, why you tellin' me?
They say the game ain't what it use to be on (?)
Used to be a G, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, and it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Y'all fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, what's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me Snoopy Trump
I keep my heater close, 'cause I love to bust
Now hat's a stain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga; I'm livin' the life!

Time, time for you to die
As I kiss... yo'.. ass... goodnight

I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you loose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods yo' Dungarees
And that's just the half on my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, ""Yo he nice, but that's on the low doe""
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggaz, snort-caine niggaz
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
Till Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girls nipples be
The game sour like like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin' bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggaz envious
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out frontin, smokin' somethin'
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin
I laced it wit the basic, six TV's a system
Knockin' Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, mixed shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, LONG KISS
{Puff Daddy - speaking over chorus}
Now... we don't give a fuck...
We just absolutely... don't give a fuck...
Because... there ain't no motherfuckin love here...

Uh... I'm flamin gats, aimin at, these fuckin'
Maniacs, put my name in raps, what part the
Game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Blackwoods and Dutchies, ya can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleedin lovely, wit'chyo, spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin tryin' to break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue, six Coupe
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin out -- the block
For distances, givin' long kisses BITCH
{Puff Daddy - speaking over chorus}
All we have to do now... is say a prayer for you... y'know?
That's all we have to do, just to pray for your mind... cause...
Eheh, see your mind got control of your heart...
When it's supposed to be the other way around
Your heart's supposed to got control of your mind...
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cold...

I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin

Be broke -- girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke yo' ass out till your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
No matter how you call it (how you call it)
This brolic, alcoholic ... {*Biggie's chorus fades in*}
Like his weed green'd out, like his brick solid

Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real doe
Sling steal slow, as for remorse, we feel no

See the fucked up thing is that I love you...

It's just in my nature to love you...
I can't hate you... 'cause it's not in my nature to hate you...
You know, I don't know...
Maybe... I'm a different type of individual...
But... you have me on the line...
And there's a thin line between love and hate
And God forbid I cross that line...
Cause y'all not gonna give a fuck
I'm tellin' you right, MOTHERFUCKIN, NOW!

44,Machine Gun Funk,1994,Ready to Die (1994),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"Verse One:
So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back, talkin' 'bout the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal
That you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin'
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggaz know... that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggaz sayin', ""Biggie off the street, it's a miracle""
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggaz actin' shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin' funk by the boxes, packin glocks is
Natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates
The funk baby
Chorus (repeats 8X)
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk"" (LOTUG, Chief Rocka)
Verse Two:
All I want is bitches, big booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats, to stop all the snitches
From stayin in my business, what is this? Relentless
Approach, to know if I'm broke or not
Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the glock
Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen
Until we motherfuckin meet again
Huh, I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the (car sirens)
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold ya head, 'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick
The funk baby
Verse Three:
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin helicopter
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
(What's Love, Got to Do)
When I'm rippin all through your whole crew
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons
Niggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
Machine Gun Funk baby!"

Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.
When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick (yeah)
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife (uh, yeah)
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch (uh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

Yo don't lie to me motherfucker
Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.
Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play celo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had (yeah, c'mon)
With a glock just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together

Ain't no jokes

Yo, don't don't play with my dick
Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G.
She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger (yeah)
One day, she put nine one one on the page
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major (yeah)
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me (uh, yeah)
And when I find 'em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch
Uh, yeah, yeah
Uh...
Uh, motherfucker yeah"

Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, ain't no competition that could sour
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead heaven
In eighty-eight, when Kane ruled, with Half Steppin
A thirty-eight, a lot of mouth, was our only weapon
We was king till the G's crept in

Eventually, you know they try to do me
Fuck it
Fed up, my nigga want to take it down south
Sick of cops comin', sick of throwin' jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper, told 'em go that route
Few months, he got his brain blown out

And his older brothers, understand, the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy
You win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother

D*mn I miss you
Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G.
There was this girl around the way that make cats drool
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin' but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my drugs after school
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin with some major players
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheatin', now Drew she gotta slay her
One night, across from the corner store

The mo problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the mo money we come across
The mo problems we see"
49,Ms. Wallace (Outro),1999,Born Again (1999),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"As a child Christopher was outspoken when it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are as a young man he likes
To do everything he liked to read he likes to be with his friends as young kids
R young boys he enjoyed life everything that would make him happy r comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family his early
Inspirations toward rap music were the LLs of the world the sugar hills the Mr.
Magic抯 and the fat boys of the rap channel those were all the things I heard in
The house even though I called it noise and banging I know now that it is a
Accepted musical art form I was a single parent I raised my son on my own his
Father had no influence on his decision towards the musical outlet r career he
Chose my son had a mind of his own even if his father was around he would have
Turned to rap he loved music he loved rap at a point in my sons life he
Developed paranoia about death and about the dying we are living in a world of
I'm
Perfect human beings we are greed jealousy and envy or manifested by what
Others have accomplished in life my son was very very much aware of that he
Appreciated his station in life on the directions in which he was going are
Traveling on the other hand there were others who I should uh use the hip hop
Phrase player hating and I think that is what resulted in his paranoia if I had
To change anything in my sons life that would have allowed him to be here
Today I would have deterred him from a career in music I'm aware that millions
Appreciated his music millions loved his music be that it may if he hadn't
Chosen that life style that career my son would be alive today if I could sum
Up Christopher in one word the word would be generous th thing that my son
Loved most about life was the fact that he was in a position to help position
To share position to give to others who needed to others who wanted to others
Apreciat4d the gifts that he gave that's what he loved most"

Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggaz get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin' weed, flippin ki's, makin' crazy G's
Hittin buckshots at niggaz that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin' hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
That's a real nigga for ya
(Notorious B.I.G.)
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop for the town
Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hah, yo G, pass the ruler

Money hoes and clothes
Blunt smoke comin' out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flippin on foes, puttin' tags on toes
Watchin the stash grow, clockin the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigga
Gettin' paid so much, all the bitches wanna see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I wanna get laid
Or since I got loot I wanna knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex at the two or three Benzes
I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, puttin' the swellin on your eye
And your nose even, when I choke ya you stop breathin
And when Jake come, I'm leavin'!"

Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in ranges, believe them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo killings clean, slugs up in between
They eyes, like True Lies, Kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' wit put bombs in yo moms gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with thirty-three-eighties
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch, I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin' real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five a piece
Enough to cop a six buy the house on the beach
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream no one considered a leech
Think about it now, that's damn near one point five
I kill 'em all, I'll be set for life Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed
Niggaz bleed just like us
Picture me bein scared
Of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Niggaz bleed just like us
Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfuckin beef cook
Niggaz bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin
My life in that man hands, while he just decidin'
Niggaz bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocol
Verse Two:
Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tucson, pushed the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rocked the Isley
Stupid as a young'un, chose not the moves wisely
Sharper with game, him and his crooks, called The Jooks
Heard it was sweet, bout three-fifty a piece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back, speakin' Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
Here's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated, he mean it
Nothing to lose, tattooed around his gun wounds
Everything to gain, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money ya dyin'
Specially if my daughter cryin, I ain't lyin'
Y'all know the science
Verse Three:
We agreed to go in shootin is silly
Because niggaz could be hidin in showers with Mac Billy's
So I freaked em, the telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Astoria, I went to war with her
Peeps in ninety-one, stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place, long story, Glo seen my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was comin' for the safe
Now she breakin, shut up, 112, what's shakin
A Jamaican, some bitches I swear, they look gay
And a black Range Rover, been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way
Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggaz bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't need
Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we bout to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice
Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline, the nigga pass me kerosene
Fuck it, its flame-able, my hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two, opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blastin
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughin', I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spinned around, shot the chink in the breast
She cryin, headshots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothin' but Franklin faces
The spot's hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dippin
I know them niggaz in the Range is on they way up
Flippin, pistol grippin, I know they clippin
The hallway, got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant

All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contend never no surrender no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand
One of my trusted fine friends, hey
Open 'n' let 'em see if we real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin
Baby we ain't marchin, we shootin'
And daily recruitin there's a thug born
Everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little we give 'em a bottle
And a pen and a pad to hit the lead now kick it
(Krayzie)
Nigga roll wit Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome wit a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck son gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this twelve gauge sawed off
Get 'em all off, nigga yo' loss, take it all off
Got a nigga car door
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinkin' they Thugs
They need the most help to pull it in doves
And bitch if you stickin we buckin them guns, tha's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But Willie be servin' 'em dummies, see
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talkin'
Like gimme back me money
Thuggin' with me killers, need us a liter
Of liquor but niggaz ain't got shit
Wit a sawed off pump chrome thirty-eight pistol
Now who ready to get bent
Nigga like me feenin for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money so
I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke
Chorus: Intro 3, Intro 2
(Layzie)
Yeah, Little Lay hey comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya wit magic
Droppin' down licks betta call on my gadgets
With a automatic status we spray time to load the glocks
But I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me do what I gotta do
So I up ma force, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie booms on my a$$ now provide the cellular phone
To call Bone, what's happenin'
Grab artillery niggaz start packin
Cause a motherfucker try to get me in the jackin, and I did him
Hit him right between the eyes, the spot was wise
Wanna test a nigga size, and it cost him
Nigga fuck around wit the wrong shit
Y'all get mo murdered all day all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggaz wanna have a little fun wit number one (one)
That red red rum rum rum rum rum rum
That red red rum rum rum rum rum rum

57,One More Chance,1994,Ready to Die (1994),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me, ""Bigga the Condom Filler""
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick, Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit
Now check this shit, I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd
Smith, I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I'll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter, skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming, ""Ay papi""
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a .44
For niggas getting mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G
You see, all I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-Town in ya, you want that old thing back
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
(I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?)
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
(I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?)
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
(I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?)
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick?
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past, let's dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with benjamins
Another honey's in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below, peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressing 'em I'm undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who's the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo, I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I nut I got to split, shit
Backshots is my position, I got you wishing
For an intermission, fuck the kissin'
Lick you down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me big for nothin', all of a sudden
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh Biggie, give me one more chance"

The prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
Is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
Or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
But they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high

Yo... yo yo
I don't brownnose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trustin niggaz since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
Yo Biggie (what? what?) She havin' my bay-bay
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high

Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cee's advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
From Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off ""Get Money"", ""Player's Anthem""
Don't forget, ""One More Chance"" and, my other hits, other shit
Niggaz spit be counterfeit, robbery come actually
In and out like fuckin' rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin' blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often
Frank Wizzard, fuck you soft or fragilla
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
Slash Gorilla, slash illest turned killer
(Method Man)
Now now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
That's infinity -- too many sick niggaz, nickel nines;
Bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty
Unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot 'em with a dart like Cupid
Until they got love for my music
Star Wars I'm Han Solo, with three egoes
And three charges, I got to ""See-three-P.O.'s""
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
Eyeball blower with no equal, niggaz swingin' swords in the WAR
That's my people, sho' nuff, befo' I roll up
This is a hold up, hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie? The Notorious
Jeee-zus, ""Unbelievable"" rhyme that reaches
And touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin
Hot -- forcin my way up in the door
To kill the bullshit like a matador
Keep your hands high (what?)"

Yeah
As I grab the Glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off, release
Straight at your dome, homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doing your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The Q-45, Glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to die
As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doing whatever it took from snatching chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sold
I want it all from the Rolexes to the Lexus
Getting paid is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I've got a Glock making motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kicking niggas down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggas getting wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns 'cause I'm ready, ready
(I'm ready to die)
Nah we ain't gon' kill your ass yet
We gonna make you suffer
In a sec, I throw the tec to your fucking neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some rec
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talking
You better act like CeCe and keep on walking
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, with stompin'
I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggas say I'm strange deranged because I put the twelve gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
Down your backbone to where your motherfucking cheek drip
The shit I kick, ripping through the vest
Biggie Smalls passing any test, I'm ready to die
I'm ready
(Time to go, we gonna put you out your misery motherfucker)
Niggas definitely know what time it is
The Notorious one in full effect
For '93
Suicidal, I'm ready
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Yeah
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
'Cause I'm ready to die)
I'm ready, I'm ready
(All y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to)
I'm ready, I'm ready

Nineteen-seventy somethin', nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms'd hurry up so I could get buck
Wild, juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York New York, ready for the likes of this, uh
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rolled herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seein' my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said, ""He's gonna be a Bad Boy""
22:05, 12 April 2006 (PDT)~~
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream, I mean
I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail
22:05, 12 April 2006 (PDT)~~
Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'
Honeys is tantalizin', they freak all night
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas livin' street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slippin'
If I'm pimpin' on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the Tec

To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps"

While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
And alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga wit the fake- blaow!
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin
And hoes clockin, here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, BIG man they never try
So we roll wid em, stole wid em

Cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin
Then proceed to walkin'
It's a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the sixteenth floor
Check it
I look deeper
I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin' or speakin'?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful
Is he in critical?
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal

Bust a gat shit
Puff won't even know what happened

Give them bullets room to breathe

Blew the fuck up
D-Rock went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit 'em twice
Got 'em right on the Persian white
Pistol whipped his kids
And taped up his wife
He said ""Yo Rock, set 'em up"", no question
Wet 'em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction
How many shots?
Man nigga, I seen mad holes
What kinda gats?
Hitch links, Cops, and Calicoles
But fuck that
I know where all them niggaz rest at
In the buildin hustlin
And they don't be strapped

Is downstairs, the engine runnin'
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if yo comin'
Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How it's gonna go down
Lay these niggas low-down
Slow down
Fuck all that plannin shit
Run up in they cribs
And make them cats abandon ship
See niggas like you do ten year bids
Miss the niggas they want
And murder innocent kids
Not I
One niggas in my eye
That's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to feel my clip in his hips
Pass the chocolate

Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me

Don't really wanna show you wut a G.I.B.
I'd rather be sippin' Remy in V.I.P.
When you hear the music it'll be by me
Twista and the legendary nigga B.I.G.
Brooklyn and K-town, when you check out the flow
U know it's goin' rain with persistence
2 legends on the same track
2 differend plains of existence
Let's get it crackin' I love to bust flows
Hit it from the back 'cause I love to buck hoe
Spit it for the city I love Chi-ca-go
Cali-coes buck, I love to bust those

A tribute to BIG I love to bust 1

With a tactic to stack snatch his rep back and stack some Platinum
Double on 'em at random
With the bullets I brand him
Fin' to hold the game Ransom
Runnin' up in ya mansion, cash demandin', flashing cannons

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell (
)
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (
)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (
)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My babies' mothers 8 months, her little sister's 2
Who's to blame for both of them (
)
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red (
)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't believe (
)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I want to leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand (
)
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (
)
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet (
)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (
)
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone (
)
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on (
)
I reached my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (
)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (

I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (

Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'

Uh, it's the ten crack commandments
What, uh, uh
Nigga can't tell me nothin' 'bout this coke, uh, huh
Can't tell me nothin' 'bout this crack, this weed
To my hustlin' niggaz
Niggaz on the corner, I ain't forget you niggaz
My triple beam niggaz, word up
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten
I been in this game for years, it made me a animal
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step by step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule numbre uno, never let no one know
How much, dough you hold, 'cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get your ass stuck up
Number two, never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence or violence
Take it from your highness
(Uh, huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats
For they bricks and chips
Number three, never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodie to mask up, shit, for that fast buck
She be layin' in the bushes to light that ass up
Number four, know you heard this before
Never get high on your own supply
Number five, never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce
Number six, that goddamn credit, dead it
You think a crackhead payin' you back, shit forget it
Seven, this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number eight, never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too
Number nine shoulda been number one to me
If you ain't gettin' bags stay the fuck from police
(Uh, huh)
If niggaz think you snitchin', ain't tryin' listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waitin' to start hittin'
Number ten, a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele say hell no
'Cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules, you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you pass
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks
She sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick and can hook a steak up
Gotta go, gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up, uh

She ain't no sucker, I know that bitch man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman lovin' a rich man
Now here you come, drop top ridin'
You ain't no pimp fake nigga stop lyin'
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that live it
Street life, pimp shit, make the hoe respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figured
She left you cause you couldn't be, like them real niggaz
She was a hustler by nature, and you was just faker
Than the average symps, found a badder pimp
Too $hort
Crazy ass man
I never woulda bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that hoe man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe!
Man I'm thirty years old nigga
And that bitch was hoein when I was in 9th grades and shit
Think about that, she been around then right?
Shit... you just a rest haven for hoes man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fuckin' witchu cause you had a good ass job, nigga nerd
Treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga
She ain't nuttin but a hoe!
Bet you fell in love with her man!
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife fool
Everytime you turn your back that bitch is fuckin' with dem gangstas

70,Things Done Changed,1994,Ready to Die (1994),East Coast Hip Hop|Hip Hop,The Notorious B.I.G.,"Verse One:
Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin' brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin' on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin' smoked G, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin' that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin' blunts in the project
Hallways, shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though
Verse Two:
No more cocoa leave-io, one two three
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a Mac-10 he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
And we comin' to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed
Verse Three:
If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin five cent gums not knowin' where your meals comin' from
And now the shit's gettin' crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky grand Pagers
Goin' outta town, blowin' up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin' took out
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed"

I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes

Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
Till Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girls nipples be
The game sour like like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin' bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggaz envious
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out frontin, smokin' somethin'
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin
I laced it wit the basic, six TV's a system
Knockin' Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, mixed shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, LONG KISS

Finessed, what I was dealt with from the day I was born

Up in them little holes, be creepin' wit mad demons
Niggaz knows, not to fuck with my dough
Niggaz know not to fuck with this little bro I'm ten seconds hit'n'go
Black mask black truck chrome rims Chuck Timbs
Enough to confuse, any witness
Strongest of calibers, is what we only travel wit
You gotta get hit, your man did, so you got a hand in it
Extort y'all, once friends, now we gotta cross y'all
You know the niggaz with the biggest balls set the new laws
And flip fours, have 'em washin drawers while you up North
Gat to your jugular, getting your salad tossed
Overhearin niggaz situation, sayin', ""Like we thought""
Sittin' on the stand with no remorse
(Prodigy)
Yo, yo how we do niggaz, I don't beef I shoot niggaz
If I can't get the main character, a few niggaz then
I don't need no gin to boost me
I got enough steam to blow, somebody gotta go
I got fire in my heart, guns in my car
Cash in my Carharts, it ain't hard to get em
Like blaow when I hit em, the nigga shit his drawers
When the 40-pound hit him, the fuck these niggaz thought?
Could it be the fame, maybe it's the 2 Benz or
Would it be the same if I couldn't claim those?
Fuckin' with, hoes ?
Cock sucker beat it while you bleed it on the dashboard
Niggaz get, what they hand call for, again bricks
You get deaded, I get erections, over revenge
Can you get a quiet spot in the shade, for a breeze
I lay a nigga down and steam roll away ?

B.I.G, get it? Biggie
Also known as the bon appetit, rappers can't sleep
Need sleeping, Big keep creeping
Bullets heat-seeking, casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching, lesson A
Don't fuck with B-I, that's that, oh I
Thought he was wack, oh come come now
Why y'all so dumb now, hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer saute, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
""He sounds demented"", car weed scented
If I said it, I meant it, bite my tongue for no one
Call me evil or unbelievable

Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear
MC's fear me, they too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play guerilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice for the nicest MC

What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
The lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake
(Korn + (Notorious B.I.G.))
I'm here, I'm watching you (if I should die before I wake)
Love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through (if I should die before I wake)
This, can be, reality (if I should die before I wake)
Wake, up, my dead face I see (if I should die before I wake)
My dead face I see, my dead face I SEE!
(Korn electric guitar w/ indistinct shouting)
(Notorious B.I.G.)
On your mark, get set, when I spark you're wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked wit death
Should I, start your breath or should I let you die
If he start to cry, ask why?
Lyrically, I'm worshipped, don't front, the word's sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stomped quickly for raw T's and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I'm punishin
I'm done wit them, son I'm surprised you run wit them
I think they got cumin, 'cause they nothin' but bitch
Tryna blow up like nitro wit dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke, but yo I rock diamonds that's sick
Got paper off my flow, ride wit my own click
Take chicks to Cairo, layin wit yo' bitch
I know you playin' you was rich
Fuck you prick, when I see you I'ma...
(Korn + (Notorious B.I.G.))
I am here, I'm watching you (when I see you I'ma..)

In the mornin, crack of dawn an' {*dialing phone*}
Now I'm yawnin - wipe the cold out my eye {*ring*}
See who's this pagin me - and why
It's my nigga Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gamblin spot, and heard the intricate plot
Of niggaz wanna stick me like flypaper neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggaz from the hill up in Brownsville?
That you rolled dice wit, smoked blunts, and got nice wit
Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah they're my niggaz nah love wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say dem, they schooled me to some niggaz
That you knew from back when, when you was clockin minor figures
Now they heard you blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So - thank Fame for warnin me cause now I'm warnin you
I got the mac nigga tell me what you gonna do
Damn! Niggaz wanna stick me for my paper

They heard about the Rolex's and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates outta state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida
The fifth corridor --
-- Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin', and flower bringin'
If my burgular alarm starts ringin'
Whatcha think all the guns is for?
All purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder, so they can devour
The criminals, tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn! Niggaz wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts witcha, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and getcha
Betcha Biggie won't slip
I got the calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckaz in a bad predicament, where all the foul niggaz went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'm a hit you with you motherfuckers betta duck
I bring pain, blood stains on what remains
Of his jacket - he had a gun he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and EXPLODE on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to ya door no beef no more nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga I bust my gun in
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'...
{*Night air, dogs barking*}
(Thieves talking)
(C'mon nigga) I'm only comin' to pass the gat
(Just bring your motherfuckin ass on, come on)

And a chrome four fifth pressed on ya back
So what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?
I hope civilized 'cause I love to see niggaz die
Brains all leakin' out on the street
And the pastor preachin' ""He was a good man""
Played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
Now he's singin' sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, bout six cross the pelvis
Ya fuck with the high guy ya die
Yeah the same motherfucker yellin' ""Look up in the sky!""

Venue after venue, I've been through
Coming to the telly, so I can bend you
Send you to the store, condoms and more
Jealous females, call you sluts and whores
Could it be my hardcore metaphor
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor
Open up the Lex door
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired
I'm a roll blunts while you spin
You got your license, right? All right, no swerving
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se
Much foreplay, that's my forte
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death
She looking for a man, honey he just left
Violate me, he get beat to death
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left
Grand Marnier increase the don strength
Two four-fifths within my arms length
With a calm breath I say we gots to float
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen
And you mean too, eyes greenish blue
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu
Beautiful, that's how the night goes
Get out them tight clothes
Get in some night clothes
I invite those girls that smoke lye
Keep it real with you
You keep it real with I
We be tight like frog's ass
Have you screaming ""Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance""

Would you ride with me? (Yeah)
Would you lie for me? (That's right)
Would you get high with me? (For sure)
Would you die for me? (No doubt)

These hoes don't treat you like I treat you
Like my contacts, I can see right through
Don't they know me and you is stuck like glue?
Queen Bitch means number one and two
Wifey, y'all ain't got to like me
Go head and act dumb, you'll just catch a hot one
Y'all know where I'm from
Bucktown, lay your ass down
You don't wanna play around (with me)
Probably just mad because Frank chose me
A fly cu-tie, you just a grou-pie
Girls call my telephone just to hang up
While me and you is in the crib, laying up
Oh he ain't tell you that we live together
And that we gonna have a kid together
Whatever, me intimidated, never
Anything you give to him, he give it right to Kim
Anyway, I fuck better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
If I fuck another nigga, don't mean nothing
B.I.G. is in my heart from the start
Whether broke or rich, I'm a stay his bitch
Chicks who used to be around, where they at now?

Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me, in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever
(Notorious B.I.G.)
Niggaz in my faction don't like askin questions
Strictly gun testin, coke measurin
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
MWA, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer, yes my dear
Shit's official, only, the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot cryin
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all -- death
Controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all, uh
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody till somebody kills you
You're nobody, till somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
You're nobody, till somebody, kills you
(I don't wanna die, God tell me why)
Uh, uh
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily, ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nuttin left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave 'em in bloodshed
Incidents like this I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore
Told me meet 'em in the future later, they'll take me shoppin'
Buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
Introduce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch shit, drinkin' Cristal
Till they piss the shit, uh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminesce on dead friends too
You're nobody till somebody kills you
Uh, uh
You can be the shit, flash the fattest five (that's right)
Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember he, used to push the champagne Range (I remember that)
Silly cat, all suede in the rain
Swear he put the G in Game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name (what was his name?) you mean that kid
That nearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine
A fuckin' shame, duke's a lame, what's his name?
Darkskin Jermaine, see what I mean?
*Chorus* 2X (fades)"
