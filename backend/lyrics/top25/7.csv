0,A Nigga Witta Gun,1992,The Chronic (1992),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Yeah nigga, what's up with all that motherfucking shit you was talking nigga?
(Hey Dre, why you trip me, why you trip me?)
Fuck that, what was up with all that shit you was talkin' nigga?
(I ain't trippin', why you trip me?)
Motherfucker lie nigga, that was you
(Nah, that wasn't me)
That was you, nigga
(That wasn't me)
Ay, check this out motherfucker
What's wrong nigga, you can't talk with a gun in your mouth? (That wasn't me, that wasn't me)
You can't talk with a gun in your mouth? (That wasn't me)
Listen up nigga, you know about Lucifer?
(Nah)
You're about to meet him, motherfucker
Who is the man with the masterplan?
(A nigga with a motherfucking gun)
Forty-four reasons come to mind
Why your motherfucking brothers' hard to find
He be walking on the streets and fucking with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See I never take a step on a Compton block
Or LA without the AK ready to pop
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I thinks it's better to be telling the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
""Goddamn,"" 'cause it's the city
And for you to survive a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To their homies that they can hang by dealing with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cause I relax, sit back, do a job and jet
Yo, I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row, come let a motherfucker know
Who is the man with the masterplan?
(A nigga with a motherfucking gun)
Who is the man with the masterplan?
(A nigga with a motherfucking gun)
D-R-E, a motherfucker who's known for carrying gats and kick raps that make snaps
Adapts to anything environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo move believe that I'm strapped
4-4, .tre-8 or AK-47
'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go with Death Row, come let a motherfucker know
Who is the man with the masterplan?
(A nigga with a motherfucking gun)
Who is the man with the masterplan?
(A nigga with a motherfucking gun)
Who is the man with the masterplan?
(A nigga with a motherfucking gun)
Who is the man with the masterplan?
(A nigga with a motherfucking gun)
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off yeah
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off yeah
I breaks 'em off but I ain't speaking about between the thighs
I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
That'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat will make any nigga civilized
Old buster-ass nigga talkin' bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doing it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my .44 Desert Eagle to his motherfucking dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name's Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die you's a buster 'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga yo so now you know
Who is the man with the masterplan?
(A nigga with a motherfucking gun)
Who is the man with the masterplan?
(A nigga with a motherfucking gun)
Who is the man with the masterplan?
(A nigga with a motherfucking gun)
Who is the man with the masterplan?

1,Ackrite,2001,2001 (1999),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"It's fuckin' Ackrite.
Question is, can I get some? You know what I'm sayin'?
Ackrite bitch.
When I see you in the spot, you just Ackrite, you know what I'm sayin'?
When I yank you by the fuckin' perm
Don't be lookin' at a nigga crazy
Just get with the digits and be the fuck out. You know what I'm sayin'?
Let me break it down for y'all.
It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
Fun to get blunted on a Sunday, afternoon
Nigga Gabe got room, grab the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate faded boom, flossin' hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodoors
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clownin' whores
Around the full good to go girls
Like them BarybY Coast girls, ridin' shotgun, baby
I be postin' all world in The Riyd
Sippin' 151 that gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'm a put my fuckin' mack down
I'm playin' lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some Ackrite
I'm a have to act wild.
Chorus: sung by Hittman
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline 'cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice.
(Aight? nD give A nigga' some Ackrite, right)
I'm the type of nigga player haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
Snobby ass bitches get slapped out of spite.
(Aight? So give a nigga' some Ackrite, right)
Uh... drink kickin' in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words 
83 degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsta's made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin' hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Gettin' swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No.""
Grab the bitch's hand ""I'm Hittman.""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""Your very eligible for my summer league team.""
Maybe too extreme 'cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethern
I got mad spit flame on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Hoe you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Witcho' lips swoll and give a nigga' some Ackrite.
Chorus (minus the word ""Aight"" both times)
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline 'cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice.
(ND give a nigga' some Ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga player haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
Snobby ass bitches get slapped out of spite.
(So give a nigga' some Ackrite)
Frontin' on Ack-rite, causin' me to act up
Good Samaritan save that hoe from gettin' slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the 1 time brigade
I would've sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks {*CAR HORN*} aiyyo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, lookin' back at us
Plus, they on the dick 'cause the cap is hush
They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tippin'
Mackin' interrupted by some niggas set trippin'
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act.
(Silenced Gun Sound)
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline 'cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice.
(Aight? nD give A nigga' some Ackrite, right)
I'm the type of nigga player haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
Snobby ass bitches get slapped out of spite.
(Aight? So give a nigga' some Ackrite, right)
Snoop Dogg: Bitch!
[Outro (Skit):] Yeah.
[Snoop Dogg:] I just wanna put my dick on your shoulder so you can put it on your mind later on.
[Kurupt laughing:] [Kurupt:] Take that dick off your shoulder and put it in your mouth.
Drink the evidence and hide the dick behind your head, the police is comin' HO 10, put this dick behind your head."
2,All in a Day's Work,2015,Compton (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Sittin' 'bout a hundred stories up, like what the fuck?
And I'm just lookin' at it all
I'll be right here in Los Angeles
Lookin' like a villain layin' low
Nothin' I can do but pack it all up
Goin' up, but shit, I feel the love
Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight
Actin' a fool and feelin' alive
I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault
Only type of livin' I know
See if it was you you would've killed yourself by now
It takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this
And they ask me how I do it
Mothafucka just take a look around
Best believe I'm in the buildin'I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that but
No, no don't mention me at all
Yeah comin' live and direct
And I know you feelin' some type of way about it, but uh
Watch your mouth, I dare your ass to say somethin'
I thought it was all good
But now you mothafuckas crossed the line
Kinda pissin' me off
All the fans and all the fame, and though I gave everything to this game
They still complain
Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?
There's so much fuckin' pressure
There's all this pressure
And it's all in a day's work
Work, hard
Workin' so hard
24/7, 3-6-5
365, hard work
It's all in a day's work
My whole life all I ever thought about was grindin'
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylus
And that was back when I felt like rappers was true mothafuckin' riders
Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster
Shit I was still sayin', ""Fuck the police""
Born and raised in the belly of the beast
I had a dream that we was at peace
But I was so wrong. so wrong
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
Now reality TV talks about pulpits and choirs
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton sick and tired
Some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate
These bitches thinkin' fame first
I can't knock the hustle, it's all in a day's work
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
Shit it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse
They just thirst
Hard times
I'm on my grind, fuck the part-time
Stay ready for war, I'm on the front line
I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine
It's becoming the only feeling I know
Only type of livin' I know
Only type of livin' I know
Only type of livin' I know
Only type of livin' I know
Gonna go to work
We gotta work
We gotta work
Let's get back to work
On the grind, back to work
Let's work
Rich as fuck, but, guess what, I'm back to work
Overseas, back home, no time to sleep, I'm back to work
So many people that I love, they want my time but I got to work
Some of my friends don't understand I got to work
Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club but I'm like, ""Fuck that I gotta work""
If you really wanna do it like this, shit you better get back to work
Back to work
Right back to work
Gotta get back to work
Shit, right back to work"
3,Animals,2015,Compton (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Uh
Yeah, check it
These old sneakers, faded blue jeans
No tricks, no gimmicks, I be stomping down, down, down, down, down demons
Rolling up trees in the belly of the beast where the people disagree
The upper class hate, middle don't exist
The bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks
Are you jumping on a fad? Laying in a ditch
I be stomping down demons, stomping down quick, come on
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we fuckin' shit up, come on
Bullets still ringing, blood on the cement
Black folks grieving, headlines reading
Tryna pay it no mind, you just living your life
Everyone is a witness, everyone got opinions
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight
Damn, why the fuck are they after me?
Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally
Still tryna figure out why the fuck I'm full of rage
I think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade
Nothing but pussy on my mind and some plans of getting paid
But I'm a product of the system raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid
Just a young black man from Compton wondering who could save us
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was unbalanced but some us used our talents, shit
Not all of us criminals but cops be yelling, ""Stay back nigga""
We need a little bit of payback
Don't treat me like an animal 'cause all this shit is flammable
Don't fuck around 'cause when it's done it's done, fuck you
And the old folks tell me it's been going on since back in the day
(Tryna tell me man) But that don't make it okay
And the white folks tell me all the looting and the shooting's insane
(I ain't tryna hear that man) But you don't know our pain (Come on)
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on
Please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on
These old sneakers, faded blue jeans
No tricks, no gimmicks, I be stomping down, down, down, down, down demons
Rolling up trees in the belly of the beast where the people disagree
The upper class hate, middle don't exist
The bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks
Are you jumping on a fad, laying in a ditch
I be stomping down demons, stomping down quick, come on

Yeah, this is DJ motherfuckin' Premier (and I'm Dr. Dre) Dr. Dre
What, Premo, yeah we fuckin' shit up
No, we don't play no games here, motherfucker, please
Aftermath, (one of the reasons that me and you click)

4,Bang Bang,2001,2001 (1999),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is

No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
Bang bang! bang bang!
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
Bang bang! bang bang!
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
Bang bang!
(Dr. Dre)
Everyday it's the same thang, L.A. ain't changed
Niggaz still playa hatin', but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggaz is bangin' ten times harder now
Niggaz ringin' they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn they car around
Rollin' the window down (Eminem: Hey can we talk it out?)
(Hitt: NAH GET THE FUCK OUT!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck tryin' to job hunt
Niggaz got AK's, niggaz is way crazier
Than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggaz spray strays and shoot without lookin'
Niggaz walk by and blast without leavin' a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your life reversed
Always tryin' to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode
Bang bang! bang bang!
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
Bang bang! bang bang!
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is

Bang bang!
(Knoc-turn'al)
Late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light
Put you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Bustin' on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggaz are dumpin
You'll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Makin' death not so foreign to ya
Niggaz got Rugers and M-14's with enough,
Ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin'
Ain't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
Bang bang! bang bang!
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
Bang bang! bang bang!
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
Bang bang! bang bang!
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
Bang bang!
(Hittman)
Now tell me - what the fuck is this man?
Niggaz doin' brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand, in front of your buildin and chill
Without yieldin, twelve-year-old children that kill
Blood spillin, thugs be illin, unnecessary slugs
Fillin the sky, usually drillin the one
That wasn't willin' to die, yes sir in the Killing Field
I got my, life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder, these niggaz got the nerve to
Question me - 'bout the colors that I got on?
Now see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong nigga to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on
My hitlist -- peep this
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground, retaliation sounds like this
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
Bang bang! bang bang!
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
Bang bang! bang bang!
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is

Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of them
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-a
Where niggas die every day over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whatever
I roll with my shit off safety, for niggas that been hating me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumping gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash

Crashin' Flex on Tuesday's, harassing hoes at movies
Passing by with Uzis, like who you aiming at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claiming that, rat-a-tat-tat
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You gotta recognize Hittman is an enterprise
Cali pride, Bronson rider South Central-ised
The Henny got me energized, smoke the guys
Tryna focus on mines, poke they eyes out, I'm L.A.'s loc'est
Hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get hit when the guards look the other way
We hitting hard, Hittman and Dre
You playing games? I suggest you know the rules
We putting guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo honey and cruise to the snooty and snooze, cop booze
Pop coochie till the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck with crews

8,Bitches Ain't Shit,1992,The Chronic (1992),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do
Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothing
Now she's suing 'cause the shit she be doing ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's taking me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize, and pass to Daz
Now as I'm rolling with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fucking hoes, clocking dough up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch and it's like that
This is what you look for in a hoe who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on
While you're chilling with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Beeotch)
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
To the store to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to Long Beach just so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothing but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes, heh
But I'm from the Pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? (Why?) 'cause a hoe's a trick
We don't love them tricks (Why?) 'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker licking the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr. Dre
Scooped in a coupe, ""Snoop we got news
Your girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues""
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin'
Move up the block as we groove down the block
See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock""
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my hoe, yo (Bitches ain't shit)
I uncock my shit
I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
(Bitches ain't shit)
Oh yeah
I don't give a fuck about a bitch (Bitches ain't shit)
But I and her know that they can't fade this
'Cause I'm doin' my own thang down with the swang (Bitches ain't shit)
I'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal 'cause I'm a bitch that's real (Bitches ain't shit)
Motherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck and I don't give a fuck (Bitches ain't shit)
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean (Bitches ain't shit)
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washing machine, I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', hoe
But they can't hang with my type on swang (Bitches ain't shit)
I ain't trying to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung and with the nuts hung (Bitches ain't shit)"
9,Bridgette,1996,First Round Knock Out (1996),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"There once was this girl I knew named Bridgette
She asked me was my dick a grown man or a midget
Of course I had to show her all my balls ring ding a ling
I whipped out my whopper but we wasn't at Burger King
Nothing more said she grabbed it like a vice grip
And asked the DOC do you mind if I nibble this
No, I took her to the back of the studio
And, she ate up on the doc like a cheerio
I told the bitch yo please don't bite me
Then she made me scream when she grabbed the balls tightly
So I slapped the bitch for goin' out like a sucker
My dick was in her mouth so she bit the mother fucker
To make her stop I pulled up on her extensions
And I left Jimmy standing at attention
The look on my eyes told the bitch she was a goner
Now I look back on the day I should have peed on her
(Bridgette) Was a girl that I knew but
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was a girl that I screwed but,
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
So you know bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so I said ok
She claims she wants to make it up to the DOC
And you know I'm still out to get the pussy
Tried to be nice 'cause I didn't wanna diss her
Passed Mickie Dees and went to the Sizzler
Ordered the food, she started rubbin my knee
Then I could tell that she wanted to fuck me
She said Lets skip dinner and I had a fit
At ten dollars a plate I said fuck that shit
That's the whole reason our relationship was stormy
Why 'cause Bridgette was too fuckin' horny
She said please excuse me for a minute
To powder my nose I said ya I'm with it
She took a long time the food came and I'm chewin
Thinkin' to myself what the fuck is she doin'?
Went to look for her and I heard alot of screamin
Looked in a room and the waiters were teamin
Up on the bitch like it ain't no thang
But I flipped 'cause it was Bridgette gettin' gang-banged
(Bridgette) Was a girl that I knew but
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was a girl that I screwed but,
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too 'cause
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if I were you 'cause yo
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
So you know Bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so I said ok
She says she wants to come over and see me
And do any thing to fuck the DOC
She said she loves me but I didn't say I love her
Went to the store and bought me some rubbers
Then I made a phone call up to the guys
Boy this bitch is in for a big surprise
When she came in I put on a stone record
Said a few lines and the bitch got naked
Later on the bed I told her to suck my dick
And ran Easy, Cube, and Dre, ran out the closet
Turned her ass over laid the ho on her back
Then we rode the bitch like a mother fuckin' Amtrak
Dre had the back and Easy had the front
I'm behind Ice Cube 'cause that's where the line started
Bitch gettin' dogged bye the DOC and NWA
Dogged the bitch out in each in every way
That's what I thought but with a girl like Bridgette
The dumb ass ho she liked the shit
(Bridgette) Was a girl that I knew but
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was a girl that I screwed but,
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too 'cause
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if I were you 'cause yo
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)"
10,Darkside/Gone,2015,Compton (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Where you at? Where you from?
Whatcha doing over here, motherfucker?
Whatcha think? What you bang?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game
Now I ain't never been no gangsta
But I know niggas, know niggas from the darkside
There's some cold killers, cold killers (My nanny used to tell me)
My nigga used to roll with us, roll with us (Every night)
Married to the more money, more women
Now I ain't ever been the one that'll pull a gun on you but I know who got 'em
No, I never sold no drugs, homie but I know who got 'em
And I never had no fucking bullets in me but I know who got 'em
If you die tonight, you die tonight
Mama might cry tonight if she find you high off the dynamite
But to you is just another Friday night, got a nigga for the car tonight
With the bible right beside that pile of white, that's what this life is like
(Now do you love your life?)
Now please don't give me a reason, reason
'Cause I know you wanna keep breathing this evening
I've been killing the game for seasons, believe him
That I'm the motherfuckin' one to breed them and lead 'em
In a league of my own, you ain't even made it up to my throne
You ain't even authorized for this songm might be best for you to get goin'
Best be careful about your tone, that shit can hit me wrong and it's on
I have tried my best to be calm, please don't make me grab that phone
Now who you know who came this fucking far from the fucking bottom?
(Uh oh) Thirty years in this bitch and I'm still here, decade after decade
And evidently I must be doing something right, word to my nigga Eazy
Eazy-E C-P-T OG from the other side (Eazy)
From the other side (Eazy)
It's easy to say you leave me
When you got everything you want
But it's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone
I went from hanging out down at the swap meet
To driving some of the hottest cars LA has ever seen
People been telling me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though, I've been this way since seventeen
Tryna get finances poppin', man, I thought that was the object
To some of my niggas lost they life and then there goes the team
My only dream was holding us down like, ""Fuck who tryna stop us?""
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm young and black, killing them softly
Don't ever call me fortunate, you don't know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me, homie
We ain't even talking, fuck that energy, fuck up off me
It's easy to say you leave me
When you got everything you want
But it's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone
You look at my lifestyle, I'm living my life now
I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin, how come my attitude piped down?
I'm fuckin' with Ice now
I'm fucking with shit that you only can get on an oversea flight now
You scared of my heights now
But still I got enemies giving me energy, I don't wanna fight now
Subliminally sent to me all of this hate, I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up, I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video? But really no clue you idiot
I just can't help myself
Even when that record spin every now and then you hang yourself
'Cause I got the green and gold with a million sold, plus plenty more, and my dollar thick
But with or without all the diamonds though to you I'm just another nigga
It's easy to say you leave me
When you got everything you want
But it's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone
You'll find out when I'm gone"

Them opinions, I don't trust those

They worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian

Niggas be talking that ain't what they want
Ain't no fake shit around here
Cause my nigga my city is really as real as the fuck
I be killing this and not giving a fuck
You laugh at a bitch, she get hid in the trunk
You think this sound crazy, that's how I grew up
So this for my people who still in the cut
Want that, need that
Root of all evil mayne, (get it, get it)
I said I want that, need that
The root of all evil, mayne
Said what's up to the nigga wearing all black at the white party
And I'm looking like I don't give a fuck
That's how I get down nigga sorry
And I'm looking like I don't play no games, nah, nigga don't try me
Been that nigga that's been spitting that
Paid dues like a motherfucking hobby
If you're on that bullshit nigga better fly that shit right by me
Came from the bottom of this bitch and made it out of that shit
And that's why we on top of this motherfucking world
Damn, look at that body
She come along with the territories
Turn around, move it for me, bend it over, end of story
(Seems like chasing paper's what's important to you)
Got a relationship with that money
(But that bitch will never be faithful to you)
Even though I know she knows she crazy
(Please just let it go, seize, no saving you)
Ride, ride
Till the motherfucking wheels fall off in this bitch
(But we can do it for the love)
But I'm never stopping my poppin'
(These numbers don't lie, but your love is superficial
It's the simple shit you need to pay attention to)
Want that, need that
Root of all evil, mayne
I said I want that, need that
Root of all evil, mayne
It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money, mayne
It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money, mayne
Want that, need that
Root of all evil mayne, get it, get it
I said I want that, need that
Root of all evil mayne"

Y'all know me, still the same ol' G, but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full o' tracks, to add to the wall full o' plaques 
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies, Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's, and the group that said ""motherfuck tha police""
Gave you a tape full dope beats to bump, when you stroll through in your 'hood
And when your albums sales wasn't doin' too good, who's the doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I'd turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all o' y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all gon' keep fuckin' around wit' me, and turn me back to the old me

Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by, with a Walkman on, when I caught a guy 
Giving an awkward eye, (

I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not, I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck, right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs, tryna walk it off, fuck you too bitch call the cops
I'm 'a kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through, me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches, and still weren't found out (

So from here on out, it's The Chronic 2, startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew (

'Cause I stay well off, now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' ""Dre fell off""
What, 'cause I been in the lab, with a pen an' a pad tryna get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath and ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So gimme one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at, it's like a jungle in this habitat

Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil half-dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowing up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Something to go by and bitches know why

Reload the protools and we throw the clip in both trays
That's one on the left and one in the right hand, Scottie Pippen both ways
Been doin' drive-bys, got this music industry timelined
Lookin' like Rosecrans when these niggas throw up them signs high
I'm talkin' about that bottom where it's high crimes
Shit, I'm just tryna get paid and keep 'em thighs high (Thighs high) 
Sometimes I feel like I could just bury 'em, bury 'em
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, scarier area

Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (corrupted)
Mama tried counselin', five plans for Kendrick (but fuck it)
My family's ties had sabotaged Rosecrans' existence (abducted)
My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (disgusting)
Our stadium's packed, raiders in black
Curls drippin', silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one way street
Nowhere to go, death all I can see
I say, ""Fuck is up?"", I fuck 'em up, your supper's up or something's up
I hoping all get orthotist, rope it before the double dutch broke
Plenty ruckus with the weapon, I protect it under oath

To become a DJ Doctor, not a grabbin turn

And you can bet that the Doctor keeps them satisfied

He operates in LA 'cause it's the place to be

24,Intro,2015,Compton (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Compton was the American dream
Sunny California with a palm tree in the front yard, the camper, the boat
Temptingly close to the Los Angeles ghetto in the fifties and sixties, it became the black American Dream
Open housing paved the way as middle-class blacks flooded into the city
Whites don't buy houses in Compton anymore
Now with 74% of the population, black power is the fact of life from banks to bowling alleys
But the dream that many blacks thought they were buying has turned sour
Though the mayor and four out of five city councilmen are black, they have been unable to solve the problems of crime and growing welfare which is slowing turning suburban Compton into an extension of the black inner city
Crime is now as high as the ghetto
Forty-seven homicides last year gave Compton one of the highest per capita rates in the country
Juvenile gang activity, muggings, small robberies make some blacks want to leave"

Come on, come on
Don't even act like I ain't about my business
Mothafucka come on!
Come on, come on
Full clip, ammunition
You don't wanna deal with these fuckin' consequences
Fuckboys should tighten up a whole lot
I got some niggas with me down for runnin' up in your spot
And these niggas got hatchets and ratchets
Some of them lethals up under the mattress
And matter of fact this is a chance to show my lifestyle out to the masses
But chances are I might get another negative reaction
Think I'm a fraction, but I fucks 'em up like battery acid
I gives a fuck what you think, nigga? This is my passion
Ride through the time, you know my name, you know my reputation
You know what it is, I don't need to give no explanation
When you say my fuckin' name, add exclamation
Los Angeles king now, make your bitch bring crowns
To me and Dre, you don't like it, you can lay
Think I'm quiet 'cause I'm actin', but my bank account gon' say
Fuck you! Respected from SoCal out to the Bay
Cashed a lot of checks this mornin', guess today was a good day
Now I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good mornin'
And the sleepers'll join the fallen
But this is what the fuck is up, doin' this for my city
Comp-town, Hub, this my fuckin' committee
Shout out to Dub C, real nigga be with me
C-Walkin' on these niggas with a crease in them Dickies
You know how many nights I heard them sparks echo in the park?
Around this time I was spinnin' records at Eve After Dark
My city crazy, school girls used to play with that chalk
Same chalk police used to outline niggas we lost
You understand what I'm sayin'? Shit is crazy, man
Fuck the money, yo this shit could never change me, man
These new niggas in this bitch could never phase me, man
I know it's strange but on some real shit it's plain as day
I'm just havin' some fuckin' fun with this rap shit
Nigga with an attitude, still gettin' active
Man this industry to me, it feels a little plastic
I ain't heard nothin' that I can consider classic
But this is for my niggas who been runnin' with me
And everybody in this bitch that's out there gunnin' for me
And I got love for my people that stay one hundred with me
I'ma keep it A1, been that way since day one
Now I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good mornin'
And the sleepers'll join the fallen
So I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good mornin'
And the sleepers will join the fallen
Drama make the city happy
All I think about is makin' classics
Classics for the masses
This how you make... classic
C-c-classic
This is where I leave you
Carry you
In the city of Compton
This is where I leave you
Carry you
Down the Pacific Coast
This is where I leave you
And I will miss you"
26,It's All on Me,2015,Compton (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Family problems, it ain't easy handling those needs
(Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do)
Baby mama drama, I just need a little time to go to sleep
(Damn, only if I had a little time for me)
Record company motherfuckers asking me when I'm gonna release
(I want the pressure homie, so much pressure on me)
And my homies on my back about me helping them get up off them streets (I mean what the fuck?)
And it all falls back on me
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me
(Somehow it always fall back on me)
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be
(Listen to me)
It's kind of funny how they fall back on me
I used to never get a call back, homie
Before the money they didn't see me like it's dark and it's all black, homie
But now they switching cause the card black, homie
It wasn't always that way
We was recording on the 4-track, homie
New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable
And all I hear is my girl in my ear
And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie
I would've never saw this happening from that far back, homie
What it came to be, would have never believed, living the life I lived in C-P-T
A motherfucking dream to reality is what you call that, homie
It was something to me
No eat, no sleep, wasn't nothing to me
Can't always be how you want it to be
And I'm the one that they looking up to
Fuck they expecting from me?
And it all falls back on me
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me
(Somehow it always fall back on me)
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be
(Listen to me)
That's just the way it is, and how it always was
DJing parties in my neighborhood just for the love
Dope dealers overtipping and bitches stripping
And any minute niggas'll start tripping and start shooting shit
On any given day I'm like ""what the fuck?""
Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs
Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
And now it's ""Fuck the Police"" all up in the club
Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit
And was like ""What up 'cause? Let me show you what this chronic like""
Couldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life
And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in (woo!)
This one of those dreams you don't wake up from
Then again, you don't sleep if you come from where I come from
Where the sun shines and they bust nines
No 9 plus 1-1
When they run up on your school bus with a two truck, you might learn something
And it all falls back on me
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me
(Somehow it always fall back on me)
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be"

Six pounds of chronic on my grandma coffee table
That's how you remember it, that's how I remember it
Yeah, dip into the liquor store, .9 in my khaki's
Crips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne
My city a trap me
Been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out
Jabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags
Disintegrate niggas went into me, dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs drippin' with Henessey, got murderous tendencies
And if you don't know where the fuck they got me from
Martin Scorsese when I pull out my gun
Scarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste
Ask your baby mama, she'll tell you how a blood taste
Basket case, still I'm back with Dre, wait I never left
Run up in Beats, ""Bitch pass the safe! Compton""
Produced by a billionaire in this motherfucker
Still smoking, Dre we need a ceiling in this motherfucker
Compton!
They're killing in this motherfucker
They're drilling in this motherfucker
Lock the door, they're stealing in this motherfucker
No chains, no reins, this my home
Nigga this hub city, no fly zone
Niggas pull out burners, start breaking like turbo on ozone
Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean and the needles lay
And switchblades, if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's
Where we dream of Montego Bay
But all we got is the swap meet
Where the cops meet, go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on the concrete
And I'm the only nigga bumping Mobb Deep
'Cause I mob deep down that side street
I'm a west side rider, live with gats on collars
Don't hate me, better get your dollars
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands
Leaning on that Brougham
Flame dump like a co-tail with my name on it
Another day in Compton, the thrill is high
Know somebody's watching, but I don't know why
Feel the fire burning, it touches the sky
Feeling coming at you, I won't die tonight
So I get by, I get by
I get by, I get, I get by
'Cause it's just another day in Compton"

Creepin' down the back street on D's
I got my Glock cocked 'cause niggas want these
Now soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a Tec-9, tryin' to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call, my niggas comin' like the Gotti boys
Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf
With their fucking heads cut off, motherfucker, I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rollin' in my '4 with sixteen switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Cockin' all the riches, got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by 'cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfuckin' D-R-E from the C-P-T
On a ryhmin' spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top, ya trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop
Yeah, 'cause if it don't stop, I have to put my shit in reverse
Go back and take another stop 'cause I'm

Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Just another motherfuckin' day for Dre so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists
It's just that gangsta glare with gangsta raps
That gangsta shit makes a gang of snaps
Word to the motherfuckin' streets
And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit ya with, that I get ya with
As I groove in my '4 on D's, hittin' the switches
Bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin, and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like Indonesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick 'cause my '4 on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip, a nigga trip to the south side, yeah

Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (With all the motherfuckin' bitches sayin')
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (You know what I'm sayin'?)
Swing down sweet chariot, stop and let me ride
Check this out, the sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip, now I'm just flossin'
Checkin' my rearview 'cause niggas they will do
Jack moves, black fools 'cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 211
Fuck around and get caught up in a 187
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynchin' but I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on, why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peepin' out they window when they hear me beatin' up the street
""Is it Dre? Is it Dre?"" that's what they say
Every single motherfuckin' day
Yo, but I ain't trippin', I'm just kickin' it
While my D's keep spinnin' and these hoes keep grinnin', I be

Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest
Bests run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Ugh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncin' off the walls, throwin' them dogs
Gettin' a rep as a young hog
It ain't nothin' like the street life
You better be strapped with yo' shank 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots ta handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time
Them say me grow up to be nothin', look at me now and tell me what you see
I am what I am, it's only me
(Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?)
Now, I'm holdin' a dub, sitting on swoll
Twenty-seven years old, off on parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I'll be making as soon as I touch the streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thing to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with 'cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so whatchu wanna do
Didn't know he had a .22
Straight sitting behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands, I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (For what?)
For trying to jack them little homies for they grip
Me learn many things from what me on the street
The outcome of what I've come to be
(Little ghetto boy playing in the ghetto streets
Whatchu gonna do when you grow up and have to face responsibility?)
Something for the real OG's to get with
Some facts, made our made, now you wanna run and play
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamien, gaming them for my homie
No need to be uncalm if you pack right
And learning just enuff to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting fo'
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting fo'
Seven young G's but they serve down
In a G ride, east side where they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county with nothing but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustling ass youngsta, clocking your grip
Now me finally grown as you can see, still an OG
For life and always remain to be

Then I woke up and realized this is my motherfuckin' real life

From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where them niggas load clips
And fats and get stabbed at home room should've skipped that class

One on the dash, one in the stash, ready for danger
I'm ready to die, I can't control this fuckin' anger

And kill yourself
Doctor's orders
Listen, this is my evaluation
This shit over saturated, y'all can get evacuated
Kids sipping Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the internet, stuck in place, salivating
Ain't nobody graduating
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn I'm getting aggravated, fuck, I'm getting agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fucking schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen acting twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four acting half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is going on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fucking Matrix
It's looking like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
I got all these patients man, how come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money, why?
When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
They gon' find out who you are, just admit 'fore you get admitted
Say, what you living about
Fuck you gon' tell me
Do you remember how you started out though
You looking lost now
(You want a pass, oh damn)
Fake it till you make it
Take your little paper book
When you look in the mirror your credibility's gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not
That's word to doc
Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
Fuck the world now
I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders
Go fuck yourself
Take two a day
Set them on an overdose
And kill yourself
Doctor's orders
In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem
I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet
No one really gave a fuck about my descent, till I took off
Mistook me because I look soft
But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm 'posed to do alls
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter
I'm going in, already got an arm and head
And whoever said word are just words
Can't hurt me more than I give a fuck
Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned
In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like
They didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it
So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime
As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind
I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine
Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
I'm starting to slow and these lines full of nines
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's)
Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders, I spray uh
Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waiting on someone to say something
Dre make the bass pump and let the tape run for old time's sake
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waiting for has come but...
Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
Fuck the world now
I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders
Go fuck yourself
Take two a day
Set them on an overdose
And kill yourself
Doctor's orders
Doctor's orders
Doctor's orders"

Even at your down-low weed spot

I didn't want people gathering and stuff
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff

Detrimental to your health, shoulda learned yo' lesson

A thug wit no love, but bitch niggas die fast
Thug niggas die young, oh what you thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome, slide back to the pad
And jack my nigga off, till his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit, cause yo my man don't know

Word takes place in the city of L.A.
I'm nine years old to be exact
Check the bell bottoms, brown shirt with the dusty ol' cap
Goin' to the inn to see my dad
And to get some new business
Two dollars what a bargain
I'm sittin' up the street while I'm humpin' a tune
The first time but witness somebody's tryin' ta jack fool
The bump director was a also tryin' ta jack a '6-4
Brothers tryin' ta tip-toe and yo
Pointin' at gauges tryin' ta take a brother's yeah
He saw what was up, got out the beat and go and bail
He just had to run in my direction
But they smoked the players
Now he's next to the sports section
But the player dropped the yeah on the ground
So then I picked it up, run down and around
The corner, yo but through a nearby alley
Escaped through a tiny gate
'Cause I was nickel slick
'Cause I was nickel slick
'Cause I was nickel slick
'Cause I was nickel slick
Huffin' and puffin' but I finally got to the pad
My mother axe me where I was I said, ""Yo,
I was over Snowy's house playin' some marks""
She believed what I said so I went to my cars
You see I ship bones with my cousin, now he's mentally slow
But he was a big ole kid, 6'5â€, 300 pounds or more
Nicknamed 'Big Truck', took the shit out my pants around the product
Told my cousin we gotta hustle and bustle to make money back
I make connections, you watch my back
Set up a program, go and live instate
But I wasn't sellin' drinks, I was sellin' big bags
O' hundreds and quarters of doves, yeah
At this time I was gettin' more pud, yo
From this car and that car and everybody wanna caught glockin'
But me and Truck we was in luck
But the spot got hot, police raid, they took Truck to jail
But me, I got away, I was nickel slick
'Cause I was nickel slick
I was nickel slick
'Cause I was nickel slick
Four years past, now I'm thirteen
All-meat duster to go undercover
My cousin's jail sentence was almost finished
Now we packin' the streets in a mix, in it to win it
Calling cards, checkin' fools, checkin' names down
Now I'm steady (unverified) sent to the ground
Other hustlers knew I was doin' my best
'Cause I was a bawla young fly player from the West
All the pimped up cribs and comeona
I'm up on the city so that way I can hit corners
Now who would expect this little juvenile delinquent's
Straight bawlin' y'all as they kept on bawlin' for it
It was a smooth operation you see
'Cause I had to your whole entire family lumpy
Five years swoop now I'm eighteen
I was steadily pimpin' Uncle Sam and foldin' the pimp game
At this time I was bust smokin' 5's
Hook us up with an eighty cell (unverified)
Lei Long was in effect and he said, ""Let's do this""
Gave it up to eat then I sighed all poopless
But Truck was left on the spot, he knew what I'd do
Hooked my cousin up with the crib and effect, not
The Truck was livin' high, livin' schwell
Me, I'm gettin' paid for my mega record sales
So there it is, a player comin' up quick
I guess I drawn a whole organization of players that are nickel slick
I guess I was nickel slick
'Cause I was nickel slick
I was nickel slick
Yo Stan, won't cha price some nickel slick from me
Right here, yeah, aha
Why don't cha swing it up right here?
Ah yeah, wooh, nigga sanctified, ah, right here
Yo, I was a player that was nickel slick"

Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
('Cause you know we're about to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'mma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earning her man
And learning her man and at the same time burning her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
(Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom)
Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beeping
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
(So just chill till the next episode)
Falling back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean
Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N-double O-P
D-O-double G-Y, D-O-double G, ya see
Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah)
So Dre (What up Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumping, city of Compton
Is where it takes place so when asked, your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slipping
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping
And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Putting the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better
Like this, that, this and uh

I can't relax 'cause I feel the magic smashin', Tony Braxton
Where your sisters at? Let's get it crackin'
Look, I was young, I was broke
Had no hope, so I wrote, that's how I cope
I went hard with no results
New approach, same truth

So they better bring troops because...
I came here to raise hell, I can't lie
One shot, one kill, it's real, I ain't hidin'
You on't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die

Simple pleasures, rockstar living
Drugs and mansions, hit the ceiling
Cars expensive, blow this action
True revealing
Satisfiction
Satisfiction
Satisfiction"
45,Some L.A. Niggaz,2001,2001 (1999),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, LA niggas
LA niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, you know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, you know what I'm sayin'?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
You know what I'm sayin'? You gotta recognize
LA niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this, peep game
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' till we threw up (Till we threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got 'em jumpin' Disciples to the Hoover
I'm coming straight outta Compton with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting with Tha Liks and Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch, hear it tick, tick, tick, tick
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sun-up, clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?
We roll deep, smoke on weed, drink, and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in LA
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in LA
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt 'cause I spit like gats do, cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you for that set you claim (Where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, CK BK
Blue'd up or flame, I ran with a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (Yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline, don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and nine's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches
I was raised in the hood called What-the-Diff'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flatline, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in, blaow, he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
Slap you in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings with Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings
We roll deep, smoke on weed, drink, and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in LA
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in LA
That's how we ride
That's how we ride
That's how we ride
That's how we ride"
46,Still D.R.E.,2001,2001 (1999),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin' with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
'99 nigga (Guess who's back?)
Still, still doin' that shit, huh Dre? (Oh for show)
Yeah (Check me out)
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was the Chronic
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my gang
Still puffin' my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Uh uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (for show)
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (for life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)

(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke till I sleep
Wake up in the AM compose a beat
I bring the fire till your soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-by's and AK-matics
Swap meets, sticky green and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether your coolin' on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on things)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin' love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbecue's every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
(Still) hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl
(Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world

And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)
Right back up in ya motherfuckin' ass, nine-five plus four pennies
Add that shit up, D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog, no stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks
Some of that real sticky icky icky, ooh wee
Put it in the air, oh, you's a fool D.R."
47,Stranded on Death Row,1992,The Chronic (1992),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Artist: Dr. Dre featuring Kurupt and Rage and RBX and Snoop Dogg
Song: Stranded On Death Row
Album: The Chronic
Intro: Bushwick Bill
Yes, it is I says me
And although agree are more than 3 'cause they're we
*Laughter*
Yes, yo! I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within' them
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this...
Path...
Called...
Verse 1: Kurupt
Stranded On Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know, the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murderin' niggas, Yo and maybe because of the tone
I kicks when I grip the mic and kick shit
Niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
Nuff respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood when we up to no good
Slangin' them things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a 10 so
When your slippin' I slip the clip in
But ain't no set trippin'
'Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whippin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' ya
Ain't nathin' but a buster
I'm Stranded On Death Row for pumpin' slugs in muthafuckers
Now you know your outdone
Feel the shotgun, Kurupt inmate, cell block one.
Verse 2: RBX
No prevention from this mention of sorts
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps
Dr. Dre will kick the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor and the tormentor
Deranged, like the hillside strangler
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite.
So what you wanna do?
The narrator RBX, cell block 2.
Verse 3: Rage
Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded On Death Row
And now I'm servin' a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead
I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck 'em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Layin' lain' with the shame, who's to blame
Me, the lady of Rage
On when I'm comin' from the D E A T H in
R O W takin' no shit
So flip and your bound to get dropped
It's 187 on muthafuckers don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block 8.
Verse 4: Snoop Dogg
And yo' steppin' through the fog
And creepin' through the smog
It's the #1 nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Makin' videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin' raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to Death Row 'cause I wanted to make a grip from servin' my rocks
And I'm still, servin' for mines, peace
To my muthafuckin' homies doin' time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin' with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's drivin' the cops crazy
But ain't nuttin' but a black thing bay-bee, uh
No I'm not flaggin' but I'm just saggin'
I betcha don't wanna see the D O double G
And you can't see the D R to the E
Or my muthafuckin' homey D.O.C.
You know you can't fuck with my muthafuckin' DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the muthafuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em man
We gotta smoke 'em, then choke 'em
Like the muthafuckin' peter man
It's like 3 & to the 2
And 2 & to the 1
Cell block 4 peace Doggy Dogg's done.
Outro : Bushwick Bill
Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think your strong, see if you can travel on
'Cause only the weak, will try to speak
Those who are quiet, will always cause riots
There's 3 types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that 
 things happen!"
48,Talk About It,2015,Compton (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"I don't give one fuck
Off the top I wish a nigga would try a nigga
Real shit, y'all counterfeit
Y'all niggas bad business
That's why the game all fucked up
Fuck Glocks, I'm all about Fort Knox, nigga
Ridin' through your neighborhood
Throwin' money out the window like ""What?""
You about the dollar (You know nothin' 'bout it)
Your poor life been without it
My life in the spotlight, oh no, no, no, I ain't even got to talk about it, talk about it
Hol' up, if you really 'bout it
Tell these motherfuckers we don't even wanna talk about it, what?
I don't know everything but one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know
(I know, I know, I know) is one day I'mma have everything, is one day I'mma have everything
It was all a dream, it was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all)
I just bought California
Them other states ain't far behind it either
I remember selling instrumentals off a beeper
Millionaire before the headphones or the speakers
I was getting money 'fore the internet
Still got Eminem checks I ain't opened yet
MVP shit, this is where the trophies at
D-R-E, this is where the dope is at
The world ain't enough, I want it all
Goddammit, I'm too old, I forgot I got it all
But Andre young enough to still get involved
And Andre still young enough to say fuck y'all
Fuck you, fuck you, and you in the corner too
If you wanna beef, make sure that that's somethin' you wanna do
There's some missin' people that felt that way too
I don't know everything but one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know
(I know, I know, I know) is one day I'mma have everything, is one day I'mma have everything
It was all a dream, it was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all)
What the fuck was y'all thinking?
You let the wrong young nigga link with a legend
'Lotta new niggas talking crazy on the records
I'm the only king here, you can tell 'em that I said it
I'm the black Eminem, I'm the humbler 50
I'm D.O.C., who do it better? Nobody fuckin' with me
I murder rappers everyday till police come and get me
And Dre just come and bail me out and then we hit the studio
Ain't no new rap in my ear, too many depressed niggas
Emotional every song, deserve to have breast niggas
Crying bout my old girl, funny how I left niggas
Trying to get my ex boxed, Red Ring of Death niggas
I'm Kanye raising the diamond on the day of his chainin'
If this was you, your diamond wouldn't be worth the appraising
I'm just talking reckless, I'm just off the record but I mean it, kept my blessings
We was dreaming, now we close enough to see it
I don't know everything but one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know
(I know, I know, I know) is one day I'mma have everything, is one day I'mma have everything
It was all a dream, it was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all)
Listen, I've been tryna get it all (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm just in this bitch, I'mma show 'em how to get involved (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah I want everything (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah I want everything (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Talk about it, hol' up if you really 'bout it
Tell these motherfuckers we don't even wanna talk about it, what?"
49,Talking to My Diary,2015,Compton (2015),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"I just need y'all to try to bear with me for a minute
While I talk about the pages of my diary
Listen up
I remember when I got started my intention was to win
But a lot of shit changed since then
Some more friends became enemies in the quest of victory
But I made a vow, never let this shit get to me
I let it pass, so I consider that part of my history
And I'm strong; financially, physically
Mentally I'm on a whole 'nother level
And don't forget that I came from the ghetto
Sold a new house for my moms, that's special
I let you going shopping till your feet get tired
Then a new Benz just for you to ride in
When I didn't have it, you provided
Don't be surprised that I built an enterprise
And my house got a view of the city like a highrise
I'm just talking to my diary, I'm just talking to my diary
When I open up my book I think about the world later
No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind
I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
Now puff-puff-pass got a nigga having flashbacks
I remember how it used to be
Now my money like NASDAQ, my checks you can cash that
I remember how it used to be
I used to be a starving artist so I would never starve an artist
This is my passion, it's where my heart is
It gets the hardest when I think about the dearly departed
Like the nigga I started with
I know Eazy can see me now, looking down through the clouds
And regardless, I know my nigga still proud
It's been a while since we spoke but you still my folks
We used to sit back, laugh and joke
Now I remember when we used to do all-nighters
You in the booth and Cube in the corner writing
Where Ren at? Shout out to my nigga Yella
Damn, I miss that
Shit, a nigga having flashbacks
When I open up my book I think about the world later
No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind
I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary"

I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city it's do-or-die
Them wonder why me violent and no really understand
For the reason why me take me law in me own hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
The gun goes click, me gun goes bang
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach
Them riot in LA 'cause them no really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricades us like Beirut
Me don't show no love 'cause it's us against them
Them never ever love me 'cause it's sport to break them
And kill, at my own risk, if I may
To lay, to spray, with my AK, and put it to rest
Yes we have
There have been riots, ah uh, rioting
Well I don't wanna say rioting, but there's been looting downtown
But right now Bree, what I want to show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street
How many niggas are ready to loot?
(Yeah, so what you wanna do?) What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
(Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine)
What they told us today, in other words, you're still a slave
No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit
Sitting in my living room, calm and collected
Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective
'Cause what I just heard, broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing
Laugh now but cry much later
You see when niggas get together, they get mad 'cause they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the ese's help and, nigga it's time to rob and mob
(And break the white man off something lovely
I don't love them so them can't love me)
Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'mma cock my glock and pop till they all drop
(There has been videotape and you can see of the, ah, some of the crowd throwing things at the officers)
And swinging at them as well
Like there was a young woman there
You see she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand
How many niggas are ready to loot?
(Yeah, so what you wanna do?) What you wanna do?
I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
(Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine)
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger so niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city it's do-or-die
One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints on a nine I throw away
Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
Pop, pop, pop, another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like, plop, plop, fizz
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo
Creepin', with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut
And crack-up, so now he best to back up
I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up
I zip up-town but motherfuckin' cops are all around
Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin'
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no, suppose black refuse to go
This is now covering a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, ah, ignited
I mean, from here to the, ah, to the south end of South Central is a long way
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
The outcome of this is destruction so them all fall
Niggas don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall
The description of three blacks
Shows no justice, so, pick up it's your right
If you riot again, me turn the other cheek
We be too many, me got me nine to my side
So me bust, flick, 'cause he don't give a fuck and me don't give a fuck
And all my problems end with that buck, buck
Blam, blam, blam to till them fall
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye
Dr. Dre, him bust gunshots
Diggidy Daz and RBX them bust gunshots, come again"

56,The Message,2001,2001 (1999),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P.
A message to God
Since you finishing 'em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow, later we'll regret till death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last 'cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us; so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him 'cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too, I had plans on watching him grow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go
Listen listen listen, listen, listen (Whoa)
Listen listen listen, better listen (Whoa)
Listen listen listen
Listen, mmm-mmm-mmm
If you wanna know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do ('Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me ('Cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper
You'se a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
'Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you
Listen listen listen, listen, listen (Whoa)
Listen listen listen, better listen (Whoa)
Listen listen listen
Listen
If you wanna know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do ('Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (Don't worry, don't worry)
I'm just hustlin everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper

Ah oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

Listen, children listen
I'm tryin' to tell you somethin' good
Don't get caught up in the hood
Yeah, yeah, whoa
If you don't know why
You gotta find out the reason why
Brother, brother
Who are you? Dr. Dre, haha
Are you a real doctor dude?
I mean, like, you know, can you prescribe some drugs for me man?
Come on, dude, I'll, hey I'll split whatever I get with you, okay?

59,The Watcher,2001,2001 (1999),Hip Hop|R&B,Dr. Dre,"Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changing, young niggas is aging
Becoming OGs in the game and changing
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rapping
When niggas get wrapped up in image and acting
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags, when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost them both
Went visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show
Everywhere that I go ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know so I suggest you lay low (I watch)
I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?
Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither, it's either my life or your life
And I ain't leaving, I like breathing
'Cause nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fucking with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes
Everywhere that I go ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know so I suggest you lay low (I watch)
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we're raised in
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed outand pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters living amongst us
Lookin' at us, now calling us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfucking thanks I get?
It's funny how time fly
I'm just having fun just watching it fly by
Everywhere that I go ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know (The watcher)

What's the difference between me and you?
Back when 
 was rollin' wit Lorenzo in a 
I was bangin' wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business, but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga Doc, and 
 I'm still wit you
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is, and who I'm still cool wit
Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with
Claimin they non-violent; talkin' like they... 
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same
Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to living big-dog-style and straight coastin
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions

Yo I stay wit it while you try to perpetrate, play wit it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (Yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash the critics like a overhand right from 
 (Yeah!)
Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions
I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot 
 at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down - pass it around, you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they 
 laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath till ain't none left
Yo that's the difference
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions

 Aight, hold up hold up! Stop the beat a minute!
I got somethin' to say, Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me
 (What The fuck?!)
 I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you dawg, I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit
 Riiight? ... Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
 I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?
 Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
 Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the 
 and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub till the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like 
 was lost product
That's for even THINKIN' of havin' them thoughts thought up!
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream 
 and see who means it!
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to living big-dog-style and straight coastin
What's the difference between me and you?

Gobble and swallow a nut up
Shut up and get my cash
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-deuce in a plush, six-deuce Impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala

Relax one night, and pay to stay with hoes

You into hitting bitches all for the grip, you punk bitch

Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on

While the West Coast rolls along
While we, still making gangsta hits
You'll be, still jocking gangsta dicks
Damn girl you think you're slick?
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch
I got these freaky hoes clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A twenty-four year old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your '64, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowing the ho for four days, pimping repays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I'm out your pussy when I nut, fo' real
