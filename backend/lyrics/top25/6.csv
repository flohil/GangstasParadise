0,(O.J.) Wake Up,1996,Tha Doggfather (1996),Hip Hop,Snoop Dogg,"(Snoop) Yeah man, this shit here gonna be bigger than the O.J. case
(Tray Deee) What?
(Snoop) His dick
*Laughter*
(Tray Deee) Another blast from the Long Beach section
Break gangsta shit (Wake up)
I thought these fools knew
(Verse 1: Tray Deee)
Out on the scout I'm about my papers
Cause ain't nobody doin' Deee no favors
I'm tryin' ta get major with minor risk
Maximisin the minimum of time is spent
On the heist, nice and easy believe me
I take mine and make mine extra cheesy
Keepin' niggas in a headlock
Undress em, press 'em down in a full nelson
I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one
They slip and I'm bookin em
Fuck fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips
Chips to the neckline 'cause I got a Tec-9
Check mine like a pimp-main ho
So hope you only see me when my grip ain't low
I go up in ya like a skeleton
So S-N-double O-Please let 'em know the crew I'm bailin with
(Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg)
East-side LBC
Is what I claim but my game is DPG
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip
And in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch
Is money all that makes you move?
You ain't doin' what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove
Somethin' to the ones you love but you needs ta know
If you ain't doin' it for yourself it don't matter d'ooh!
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up...
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up...
Wake up, wake up wake up...
Get up, get up, get up...
(Verse 2: Tray Deee)
I break fools off like leprosy
If they dare, you stare when they next to me
I'ma threat to whoever sweat my style
Hard gangsta aim to represent till death
Reality, you battle me you be in the dirt quick
I'm clever with whatever type of weapon I work with
The bare hand man sleeper
I even banked up and shank motherfuckers in the *?penta?*
I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time
So try me you're liable to lose on my line
The 44'll be what cracks ya head
'Cause that's exactly what I'm bout ta cap you with
I figured niggas gettin' soft like jellatine
So Doggy Dogg tell 'em all who we're sailin wit
(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
East-side LBC
Is what I claim but my game is DPG
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip
And in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch
Is money all that makes you move?
You ain't doin' what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove
Somethin' to the ones you love but you needs ta know
If you ain't doin' it for yourself it don't matter d'ooh!
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up...
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up...
I had to wake up, wake up wake up...
Get up, get up, get up...
(Verse 3: Snoop Dogg)
Uh, gonna work that motherfucker and do the percolatin
Cause Snoop Dogg came back with the head raider
Al Davis's? Nah nigga Tracy Davis
The Eastside Long Beach greatest
Criminal with style and boy you love that
Sit back relax and let me drop another rap
But this one's for the sisters and not the hoes
The ones who be groovin it on the step shows
Let a nigga in, I ain't diss ya friend
And like The Staples I make sure we do it again
But don't blow a nigga up or show a nigga up
And don't think a nigga sprung 'cause you know a nigga fuck
Love is a house and you got the key
So give it to a nigga like a D-O-double G
I'm from the...
(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
East-side LBC
Is what I claim but my game is DPG
And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip
And in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch
Is money all that makes you move?
You ain't doin' what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove
Somethin' to the ones you love but you needs ta know
If you ain't doin' it for yourself it don't matter d'ooh!
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up...
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up...
I had to get up, get up, get up...
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up..."

The dog saw 'im... they tear... they... looked liked they try to tear him off.
I said ""Oh my God! They want to eat my husband
I was sittin' at the pound about to eat dinner
Had a hard day at the studio, I was gettin' thinner
My nigga Sparky-O was playin' basketball
And my niggas in the backyard, y'all about to squab my Doggz
Dirty ???? gets CREAM, it's a good scheme
But you know it's all a part of the Corleone team
I squabble... Friday 'cause that's what I do
Dogg Pound for life nigga, uh thought you knew
But you didn't, you think I'm kiddin nigga, my Doggz scrap
They get down for theirs, bring 'em right to the back
Hit the gate don't wait and ask the homey Nate
He gotta pit named Tiny mobbin behind him
Now they've got Michael Corleone
Oh, Kurupt he got Lonely the psycho assassin
He likes to smash on, uh
And ain't no need to reach for heat 'cause you can't get your blast on
Doggz we keep em, busters we sweep em
And when it's time all my Doggz'll bite your momma
We leave you niggas on stuck in paws
And I'ma dedicate this one to my Doggz
Remember that pit, the one I had named Petey
Uh, she got killed so I didn't need him
Uh, it's like that, what about Sweetie?
He got killed too (damn) so I didn't need him
It's a cold thang but it's a cold game
But when you wit a Corleone name it's a cold thang
Cold name, cold game ya got ta get down
'Cause if you don't then you can't represent the Pound
Now it's like a sport
And if I get caught I'm right back in court
So I gots ta keep it on the DL and don't yeezell
But you know I gots tha pitbulls for seezell
So if you want one, get one, holla at'cha boy quick
'Cause I'ma be on the lookout for the sell-to-dem pigs
Ask my little homey Technique
I 'came Scarface, Corleone killers, baby boy OG
The homey Tray Deee I give him rock seat
But the rest of the pits they rollin' wit me
We're layin low in the cut, holstered up in Chino
Scrappy-Du and the crew called the Gambinos
Ma bark and she'll spark up some shit real quick
Just last week y'know what? She bit the shit out of me
???? Bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet
To get the bitch up off me
And I can't tame her and I can't blame her
That's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer
Man, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for y'all
But I got more love for my motherfuckin Doggz
It's just...
Me and my Doggz (sick em), me and my Doggz (sick em)
(Beware, beware) Me and my Doggz
Now when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese
But as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm soopafly like Priest
I unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim
I'm bout to trip off Locko 'cause he go taken my swim
I think 'cause my CREAMy low, get back to the pound
He gon' be itchin like hell to put the bite on the clown
And when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2
And ain't a damn thang that your ass can do
I think it's 'cause he lost his big homey Don Killer see
Who ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP
And leave your ass red and yeah half-head
He's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg
Don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear
Young gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head
And all the kid do was cry like a bitch
His life was a pit and mine's in the shit
(Beware, beware)
(Sick em) It's just me and my Doggz
I keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard
Just in case you niggas wanna fuck and try to act hard

Reap while I stay

Bullet tip on fire
Flyin down sunset
Motivated to win
Like I ain't won yet
Take shit over
Hell naw I ain't done yet

Chevy bouncin' up and down like a fuckin' see saw

All blacks locs on the loc
Actin' like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to da mean dogg
When I bring it to you
You be like what you mean dogg?
Then we go back and forth like its ping pong
Knowin' I should just ring ya bell ding dong
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxes
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors
I'm gone then you suddenly hip hoppin
Shit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a ?? like an m n m
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin' Slim so Shady but ain't talking Eminem
So fuck you him and him
I was gangbangin before a nigga mtv
No facade I went from the yard to a 3 car garage
To instant manaj just vintage, relentless
I mean this I promise
No Suge, No Dre, Ida did this regardless
And that's what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucka, this crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin 40s still a big deal
Ponytail still swanging, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded

Backflip back to plack shit
Blue red white to black shit
But for the green I send a whole motherfuckin team to clack shit
React to mack shit

Check this out
Snoop Dogg
Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I dust off my knees
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm tyring to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And get you gun out
And shoot'em up till they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
It feels good my friend
Silkk brought the Gin and Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
A drug dealer at the same time I love to smoke
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name
Choruos Fiend
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb, 'cause we smoke too much weed repeat
Fiend
I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it, unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Extended glock clips allow me to cop chips
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Cold blooded killing for ??? this
Soda couldn't rock this
Chop a shelf when I drop this
My ??? can't chop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before
Soulja Slim
Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
I seen my nigga, nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being
Shot
Silkk the Shocker
Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels goo to be on the outside
I had 120 dollars, but I spent a 100 on my ride

*Repeat*
It's structures to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a player in the game and I know not from college
Eyes open, focus, scopin out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends
I hope things get better for you
'Cause I'ma make things get better for me
And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB
The L-L-G wit DPG by the sea
We ride at high tide, the East is my side
I'ma tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
Oh yes I'm fresh and like spy from existence
Wit persistence I perceive
To supply you wit what you need, no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crsytal
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm tryin' to keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
*Repeat x2*
*?Teatlet?*, hold em, shake em, roll
Fly G boys and all you hoodrat girls
Pound puts it down all around the world
But let's pick up the litter, LB young nigga
I need solar on my Dogg nall, I bark when it get dark
Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Always, strays try to follow me home
Uh, to get the pooper scooper, why? They droppin' doo-doo
I'm steppin on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashin full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got 'em waggin they tail
For the bow-wow LBC style
Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want 'em close enough so I can lock on em
Wit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em
Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten, uh
Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?
Major trick we're hittin licks like a doberman gang
Y'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy
Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
*Repeat x2*
They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
We'd out, Dp'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knockin' at'cha door
We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses
Knockin' niggas llike cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
'Cause for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin
Bustin', no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone
For the D-O-double G (with the solid gold rhyme)
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

Ya, uh
I was once told
You get your freedom
By letting your enemy know that
You'll do anything to get your freedom
Then you'll get it
It's the only way you'll get it
When you get that kind of attitude
They'll label you as a crazy negro
Or they just call you a crazy nicca
They don't say negro
Or they'll call you an extremist
Or a subversive
Or a setatus
Or a red or radical
But when you stay radical long enough
And get enough people to like you
You'll get your freedom
So don't rum around here
Tryin' to make friends
With somebody whos deprivin'
You of your rights
Their not your friends
NO... they ya enemys
And treat them like that
And fight them
And you'll get your freedom
And after you get your freedom
Your enemy will respect you, and will respect you
And I say that with no hate
'Cause I don't have no hate in me
I have no hate at all
So I say to you, Big Man
I'm the man you think you are
If you want to know what ill do
Figure out what you'll do
And ill do the same
Only more of it NICCA

Oh it ain't over muthafuccaz"

On W-Balls, right now, somethin' new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, 'cause we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick
Verse One: Nate Dogg
When I met you last night baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for ya lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
'Cause I have never
Met a girl
That I love
In the whole wide world
Verse Two: Kurupt
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin indo to smoke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin' I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Approach it with a different proposition, I'm Kurupt
Hoe you'll never be my only one, trick ass beeeitch!
Chorus: (repeat 4X)
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg
Guess who back in the motherfuckin house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth
Hoes recognize, niggaz do too
'Cause when bitches get skanless and pull a voodoo
What you gon do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun, if my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em
Verse Four: Warren G
Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back
So back up bitch 'cause I'm strugglin, so get
Off your knees and then start jugglin
These motherfuckin nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

Can't let them see me weak, I need to find something
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me?

I lost some, let's toast to one
So put 'em high, lets reminisce
You're gonna aim, but you'll never miss
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So raise a glass to the memories
Set 'em free and fill up all those ashtrays
Fill up all those ashtrays
Tomorrow when you wake up and realize life ain't fair
Throw it back, and make the whole world disappear
You never miss what you had until it's gone
When it's right, something always will go wrong
Now my buzz is goin', I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak, I need to find something
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me?

I ain't had this much fun since '79
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing
Playin' football up in Powly High
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside
Homocides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin' much
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up
Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end
So next year we can do it all again
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and dillusion, my conclusion is confusing
Drippin on my memories, twisted off my music
Tryin' to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it
It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising
And Eastside niggas is the shadiest (shadiest)
But them Westside niggas is the craziest (craziest)
Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First thing first, 'cause, stop smoking cess weed
You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, better days ahead, Freddy's dead
And Betty said Eddie's a fed
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head
And he fuckin' with this hoodrat that he met up in dance
Betty gettin' mad cause Eddie wanna share
But look at how you livin' for a minute then compare
I love confetti, I always stay ready
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just one gun
My nigga, and who said killin' wasn't no fun
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Coroleone
Tragically casulties and fatalities
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson
Slow down and go down, shit you know now
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First things first 'cause, stop smokin' cess weed
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way
(Somehow someway)
You got to make a better way

I feel your pain nigga.
I used to be just like you nigga.
Before I got off in this rap shit.
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar.
You know, but one thing I never did do.
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing.
I went out and got my own ya feel me?
So from me to you, man to man.
Better days ahead my nigga.
Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on.
'Cause I'm a get mine regardless.
Nigga wether I'm rapping or on the streets.
I gotta have it."

Yeah... time to bring yo' ass to the table y'all
It's X to the Z Xzibit, yeah (Where you at?)
Snoop double-D, uh, O.G. (West coast, Los Angeles)
What, bringin' it live, with Dr. Dre, what?
{*Xzibit makes the ""Ghetto Bird"" sound*}
Throwin' up a BIG-ASS W, coverin up the world right?
Yeah! Hah, listen look
You ain't tryin' to hot box with me, I swing hard liquor
Goin' down by the second round, all hail the underground
How dat sound? Xzibit backin down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense, terrorist, hidden bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggaz with problems keep on steppin
Xzibit ready to scrap, like Mike Tyson with his license back
Nine to five, minimum wage, what type of life is that
For me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin' around
With the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin' tryin' to stack my loot
While other rappers gettin' ""Treated Like a Prostitute""
So check the SoundScan
Chorus One: Snoop Dogg
All I wanna be was a G, ha
My whole life, nigga please, ha
Breakin off these motherfuckin keys, ha
Let's get these motherfuckin G's, ha
Nigga you don't wanna fuck with this...

Shit, we fucked in the rental
Lincoln, Continental
Hmm, coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago
(Yeah nigga you know what's happenin' man)

(These bitches know what time it is)
Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know
(Hell yeah, hoes know about a nigga like me MAN)
I get the pussy everywhere that I go
(I pimp these hoes, nigga, ha ha)
Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know
Chorus Two: Xzibit
Bitch please, get down on your god damn knees
For this money chronic clothes and weed (look)
You fuckin' with some real O.G's
Bitch please
Bitch please, get down on your motherfuckin knees
We came to get the motherfuckin G's
Yeah, you fuckin' with some real O.G's
You dick-tease!
(Snoop Dogg)
Bitch, please! Now what you need to do is
Hem my coat, and roll me some dough (f'real)
Different strokes (uh-huh) for different folks
Oh, you like settin niggaz up and gettin' them loc's
A cute lil' bitch with a whole lotta heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
She say she gots a lick for me (well hook it up)
Worth about, two hundred G's and thirty keys
Now check this out Dre, now if I don't move
Then a nigga like me, shit I don't lose
But you know me, Dogg I'm movin
Ain't nuttin to it, but to get to groovin
You been, waitin on a nigga like me (whas' happenin')
To take that chance and rob yo' man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance (yeah right)
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
See we go out with a bang (bang BANG!)
I'm tryin' to work this cold thang, and take this whole thang
I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho (fo' sho)

Daz is coming and there'll be no more waiting
Watch it!Watch it!
Kurupt is coming and there'll be no more waiting
Watch it!Watch it!
Doggystyle is coming and there'll be no more waiting
You might be shooting up close with the Itial ever lose respectin
Verse 1:(kurupt)
Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Thinkin' many plots blossoms how amny times?
I'm sedated my (?conscriptiated?) from beginning
Broke in the bombest weed smoke that will make a nigga choke
To my loccs way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L-ong Beach
To my bulls out in Philly 'cause all they smoke is phillies
Wit' these silly ass bitches out for a niggas riches
Now really really ever slip or trip
A big shout out to my niggas in ??
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MCs like ships
With my nocturnal rhymes and editorial clips
I gotta click that'll hit you like a thousand volts
The homies catchin cases, robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Listen in, get elevated off the verbal contact
Brigde:(dat nigga daz)
When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
When a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
VERSE 2:(DAZ, BAD AZZ,*unknown*)
My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact that with contact we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle, while mistreat
Any MC tryin' to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
In '96, with a diff'rent approach I'm shit
I got the flavour and I'm major, bust the ass
Niggas can't stop us and can't fade us
Shady ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya, swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I bet'cha I won't let ya escape
Face-to-real on point-to-train-to kill beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area, rather we toast
So at home I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MCs try to step they get lit and blown
At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, stayin true
Demanding my respect, respect is what I've given
So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven
To the point of no return so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
.45 calibre Glock, gat, gun or pistol
Whistle and watch all my homeboys come run
Or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with
When we bust I let loose, this is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it but can't fade it
With the every attempt they fail, oh well
Consequences get suffered, I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp,(the deal is) the deal is this-
I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
I'm stompin, steppin with my projectile weapon
Wuz up (?Jex?) so's eject the hum
When I swarm through, who knew about the real deal I conceal?
But still can you feel the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must!If I bust
My brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MCs who compose the violence
Bringin' drama with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, somethin' up my sleeve to intrigue
And these MCs will be Gs also D-P-Gs and L-B-Cs
When we do the do to you so go call your crew
And who wants to compete with technique
Conflict will be verbal so watch how you speak
And what you say when I display
Sleepless acts as (?bombin ya?), suffer from insomnia
And I'm a gonna be comin' for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
(Watch out nigga!)

Fun of get to you, life is very hard
So many faces bearing the battle scars
But love I bring to the people
Coming straight from the heart
If crisis is what we see
All over the world is pure controversy
One man can't put the price pan humanity
It seems like the whole world's gone crazy
Everybody knows Johnny came from the roughest part of town
Survived the School of Hard Knox but still came up and made his chips
The realest life, never watch it down
Walk with a gun through the heart of town
We hearin bam bam bam, a familiar sound
To the youth down in the gully where Johnny boy done grow
He never thought that he would make it out
It's crabs in the barrel down in ST close
As I take a look down the boulevard
Fun of get to you, life is very hard
So many faces bearing the battle scars
But love I bring to the people
Coming straight from the heart
If crisis is what we see

Poor Johnny Johnny got stuck for his money
Things get funny when you rump with the daddy
Later on the goons pull up in the black Caddy
Next step on the news them find another dead body
Tales for the inner city
We break it right down to the nitty gritty
Who's responsible for the crime and poverty?
What a tragedy
Wayoo
I wish that I could single-handedly free the entire planet
Turn from crying man poverty
Love me when the love he say they near
When we burn real seize and jealousy unheard
And you take me one, you are part of this effect
Come into slavery, we would be emancipated
If they break our eggs then co-operate
Not a gyal stop me from achieving the greatest
As I take a look down the boulevard
Fun of get to you, life is very hard
So many faces bearing the battle scars
But love I bring to the people
Coming straight from the heart

I got my own spot and I got my own keys

Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at the ?? home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fuckin' with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)

41,Can't Say Goodbye,2008,Ego Trippin' (2008),Hip Hop,Snoop Dogg,"Chorus (charlie wilson):
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye
I can't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the streets (to my problems)
Charlie: I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
I can't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
Goodbye
To the hood
I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the homies
Verse (snoop dogg):
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me ""just leave it alone boy,
Let them do them take care of your own boy""
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,
Pay day, got the spot, got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse
Chorus (charlie wilson):
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say a goodbye
Verse (snoop dogg):
To the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made
Me, tough enough to hang on the corners that would mould me
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me,
But if they think the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted
To the life, you just don't OD, shit I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my momma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams in what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands in what not shit, you think I forgot, man naw
Chorus (charlie wilson):
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye
Verse (snoop dogg):
Thank god every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more wars to get
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit
They made me how I am, the music in the man
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans
Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name
Would live... in these streets
Chorus (charlie wilson):
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye
I just can't say goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye

But you can't take the streets out the man"

Twenty first a nigga, yeah that's where a nigga live
I'm on the GA and fucked the D.A.
Why? Cause the railroad the homie easy
And just cause the didn't know what (Whasup)

We are living in a world
Where anything can go at anytime
And if you ain't up on the game
Then I suggest you rearrange
Cause change gone come
And it ain't waitin on no one
They got me plottin from the bottom
With the ??? ain't no stopin'
And all I want for Christmas is forty city hoppin'
Is the to much to ask fo', oh no
And I heard through the eastside you spend to get some dough
So when you get your funk, go take to the store
Take it to daddy rap cause hes a pro-fessional
Guaranteed to get your shit up off the flo'
Beach city rider you know, fo sho'
You see that what flossin' is all about
The tightest rider gone turn it out
Bouncin', swirving and looking cute
Dogg Pound out the moon, Johnny longing for soup
Everybody in my family is nervous and waitin'
How can I be patience?
Look at what I'm facin'
They ain't the ones that gonna be riding to the station
So it what it all boils down to just some inspiration
Interpretation, the conversation you had with the judge
Of all judges budge this
And put it in perspective all praises due, true
We are living in a world
Where anything can go at anytime
And if you ain't up on the game
Then I suggest you rearrange
Cause change gone come
And it ain't waitin on no one
For all the drama I done went through
To get this to ya
How do I think I was gone do ya
Have you been mislead, since I asked you all to creep with me
You coundn't be cause ever since it's been DP
LB-B.S chronic in my chest
Deathrow doggystyle holding down the west
With a shot of what gangstas drink
And a took off for a choke off, the most kept my G's off a toast
And keep LBC singing y'all, DP ginging y'all

To gain a whole world livin' trife but then lose his soul?

Kill every demon and snakes that make, even feds steamin
Even though my star gleamin man my life ain't trouble-free

It's no better people who have left the problems of today
Leavin' to conclude that for their life is not the way
But every problem has an answer, and if yours you cannot find
You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you piece of mind

Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood
Heyyyyyyeahhhhey

So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed
Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong
Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have
As God blessed the child that can go get his own
And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feelin' like this life is a trip
Tryin' to keep our hearts pure through the sins
But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich
But to them they can endure to the end and win

Take you where the gangstas play
Often heard but seldom seen
That's the way that its supposed to be
When you do see me
Mobbin wit a gangsta lean
Got a piece by my side
You can ride baby close your eyes girl

Ten times outta ten catch me toaten the tool
Laid back or stay strapped for pay back
To think that I'm slippin then crippin from way back

Throwin' dogg pound up
Snappin my fingaz stompin my feet
It's what you get from a gangsta with these hard ass beats
I'm cool as fuck and don't say to much
Talk shit to the homies 'cause they know what's up
As the gangstas go dead diggle my niggle
Still got patience still makin' niggaz

This is a service public announcement going out to all the paper haters
Now sure sure sure your broke sure sure sure your having problems
Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here
(Snoop)
Here's a little something about a nigga like me
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my AK
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out
Now I'm that motherfucker y'all read about
Smoking you and your crew, taking a life or two
You don't like how I'm living well fuck you
This is my gang nigga No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute
With the pow pow bang bang and your dead
And then we stamp that tank on your forehead
Everywhere we go they say ""DAMN""
Them gangstas they be fucking up the program
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no we to busy saying yeah
About drinking straight out the ???? bottle
Do I look like a motherfucking role model
To a kid looking up to me
Shit life ain't nothing but weed and money
Shit I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck 'cause I keep selling
Yo what the fuck are the yelling
Gangsta Gangsta That's what the yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it 'bout it
Gangsta Gangsta That's what the selling
Bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that straight G shit
(Snoop)
Homies all standing around just hanging
Some dope dealing some gang banging
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know
I had my double pointing at his window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to ????
Sweating all the bitches in the dazzy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
So we all said ""FUCK YOU BITCH"" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga cold nutting it off
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs
I might stumble and still wont lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blue's
'Cause I'm the type of nigga who's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See I don't give a fuck 'cause I keep bailing
Yo what the fuck are they yelling
(Snoop Talking)
Hol hold on Craig B cut that shit man

South shit know what I'm saying
Some of that shit from the thiz-ird ya heard me

A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the tank but yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit
(C-Murder)
Well I'm C-Murder the one he talking about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me you know they some haters
I said ""See you later"" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back with the navy blue top
TRU niggas on the scene with the triple beam
'Cause I'm the C fool I slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a motherfucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know your jocking my crew
(Girls)
We want to fuck you C
(C-Murder)

You see No Limit niggas don't take no shit

'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to blast
If you fuck with me, I'm a smoke your ass

Yo what the fuck are they yelling
(Eddie Talking)
If you'd of just stay down and been a motherfuckers real partner you
Wouldn't have had tat problem
But seeing as you want to jump ship and you thought the ship would sink
A motherfucker without turning into a submarine, went under water came
Back up with a periscope looking at your bitch ass
Now you have no paper, and now you on a paper caper
Now you coming up to my face and your saying ""Hey can I hangout"" I say
No cause you ain't got no clout bitch get out

Put me up on the game when I step through the do'

Show her my Dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, French braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it's manditory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn

(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)

1st Verse:
Now if you tired of the hard work
Tears and sweat
And you breakin' your neck
And you still up in debt.
Walkin' round town all strapped in,
Niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did.
Two strikes none left, out of breath
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo.
All this deception on top of stress,
You havin' more problems than a algebra test.
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent,
And now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent.
It's a thin line, between yours and mine
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime.
Now I know a place where
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.
2nd Verse:
Oh your homies think you're funny?
Doin' stick ups for moneys
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack,
You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat.
You all about yo' money and got something to sell
But if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell.
You chillin' wit yo' feet up
Someone hated but baby without the homies and
That's when you got beat up.
Because you can't be out there doin' low
And then right gather up yo' crew and roll.
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt,
Somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt.
But see, I know a place where
You might wanna be
And I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.
Bridge One:
Here ye, Here ye, come one, come all.
To a place that be, call it LBC.
(I'm ridin' wit' ya' baby)
Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick,
Know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause he travelin' in the fast lane.
Stop the life it seem that we are on,
Time to slow your roll,
Let Doggyland be your new home,
Stop the life it seem that we are on,
Time to slow your roll,
Let Doggyland be your new home.
Verse three:
Doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne
(It's goin' down)
Everything is free,
And ain't no HIV. (What?)
And niggas don't kill one another
(Oh really why is that?)
Because a brother is a brother.
(And what about the mothers?)
They queens,
Righteous,
Man,
Heaven must be like this,
Green aroma like the grass in the summertime.
Ain't no peneteneries and ain't nobody doin' time.
And oh yeah, I'm the big O-K'er,
I'm smarter than the senator,
Bigger than the mayor.
Heaven on Earth
It's like a prayer.
And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got
To be a player.
Now you know a place where
You gots to be and I took you there,
Pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline."

I'm in Junior High with a C+ grade
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade
I to school from my moms apartment
I got to tell these niggas everyday don't shit
'Cause where I'm at if you soft you lost
And to stay on course, you got to roll with force
My homeboy Dogg is chilling in a Benz
In front of his building with the rest of his friends
I give him a pound no I mean I shake his hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man
I go upstairs, I hug my mother
I kiss my sister and I punch my brother
I sit down on the bed to watch some TV
[Gun Shots] Do my ears deceive me
No That's the fourth time this week
Four young brothers got shot in the street
The very next day while I'm off to class
My momma go to work cold bustin' her ass
My sisters cute but she's got no gear
I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share
So there in school I made a fool
With one and a half pair of pants, you ain't cool
Cause there's no dollars for nothing else
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
Now everyday I see my momma struggling
So now its time I got to do something
I look for work
I get dissed like a jerk
I do odd jobs
And come home like a slob
So here comes Dogg his gold is shivery
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once I do it twice
And now there's stake with the beans and rice
My mothers nervous but she knows the deal
My sisters gear now has sex appeal
My brothers my partner and were getting paper
And three months later the whole hood cought the vapors
My family's happy and everything is new
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Doggz Gonna Get Ya x4
(Mac Talking)
Ay yo yo Check this out Snoop
All these niggas always talking about
""They looove this"" And niggas got looove for you
Or nigga I looove this ride or this chin around my neck nigga
You niggas don't know what the fuck love really mean
Nigga you can't buy love at no corner store nigga
Love ain't got no price tag
Snoop I want you to kick this shit to them niggas
(Snoop)
Hmm
Money is flowing everything is fine
I bought my self and Uzi and my brother a nine
Business is booming everyhing is cool
I pull about a G a week, fuck school
A year passed by and I began to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I kick up my feet to watch some TV
Cause now I got other people working for me
I got a 55"" television you know
And every once in a while I hear ""Just say no""
Or the other commercial I love
That's when they say this is you brain on drugs
I pick up the remote control and just turn
'Cause with this bullshit I'm not concerned
Me and my brother bounced in the Benz
We driving around our territory again
I pull up at the light like a superstar
An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car
I hit the accellerater scared as shit
I drove one block to find my brother was hit
He wasn't dead but the blood was pouring
And all I could think about was Warren
Later I found it was Dogg and his crew
Now tell mw what the fuck am I suppose to do
(Mac Talking)
Yeah so now you see what I'm talkin' bout nigga
You see what that love shit do ya
This nigga said he had love nigga and this nigga done shot yo brother
So what the fuck you gone do now
(Snoop)
My brother s out of it but I'm still in it
On top of that I'm in it to win it
I can't believe that Dogg would dis me
That faggot that punk he soft or sissy
I driving around with three of my guys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We rolled right up to Dogg's favorite hang out
What's cracking Dogg and let the bullets stang out
Someone shot back so we took cover
And all I could about was my brother
Dogg jumped up and began to run
Bustin' shots hopping to hit someone
So I just stopped and let off three shot
Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
I threw down the gun and began to shout
""Ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out
Now as I left there goes the boys in blue
They pointin they guns at my four man crew
They shot down one, they shot down two
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
(Snoop Talking)
Ya see the moral of the story is this
Love is a motherfucka
And Doggs is a motherfucka
You mix the two up you bound to get some drama
Loves gonna get ya
Naw nigga Doggz gonna get ya you ever try to play me and that's real
That's real
That's real"

I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb
I told 'em ""Hit the side and slide and get the herb""
But guess who's callin, Pipedream Patty
Made that nigga park my whoride beside the alley
Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)
Fuck that nigga yo
But I can't forget about him 'cause he taught me everything I know
Oh no Joe, walkin' down the wrong lane
Tootin on that cocaine, fuckin' wit that wrong thang
Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)
Then fake the funk, doggonnit
Now loc, look at this predicament
You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit
Niggas like you, used to be in my crew
Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce
Now if you're doin' for your family and you can't stand it
'Cause you know these mothafuckers tryin' take advantage

Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend
Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in
I believe in, sharin the cock
Also, I believe in comparin the cock
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)
'Cause she love the way I just beat up the pussy
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she went down on me
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off
Ooh wee, baby you's a freak
Put my homey up on game like a gangsta
But my homey fell in love and he banked her
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist
Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back
And he get his third strike wit no get back
Say he doin' too much, yeah homey you doin' too much
And when the homey in the pen, doin' a sin
And his girlfriend fuckin' wit his best friend
Say she doin' too much, hell yeah she doin' too much
I'm livin' up in the hills, wine sippin wit mills
I'm havin' major type of paper, I ain't trippin' off bills (still)
Show me some respect and accept my coolness
And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish
Use this as a warning, 'cause I'm startin
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin
Pardon me, 'cause I ain't mad when you get bent
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. ?spray?
Friends and family, gettin' after me like repo
Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw 'em a c-note
You doin' too much when you clutchin on my touch-tone
Callin strays over nigga leadin months gone
Conversate for fo' hours, wastin mo' power
And only get to hit a cold shower
You fakin like you're makin' more moves than Simpson
But frontin, pushin buttons, doin' nuttin but sin
And when a nigga on yo' phone, runnin' up yo' bill
Tryin' to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel
You know he doin' too much, yeah nigga you doin' too much

Niggas like me don't never quit
And I still go hard on a bitch, ya bitch
You got to tell 'em what it is, don't play with the game
I love it when you call a bitch out of her name
Don't you dare try to save that ho
I know that you like her but you can't wife her

We came through and peeled his bitch so quick
From the 80's with a dope sack in my hand
To the 90's with a DJ and a microphone stand
Can't stop now, I'm in way too steep
Tech savvy with this cavy, come way too deep
Short dawg, Snoop Dogg, this for all my dogs

Hall of fame with this game, legendary to y'all

I know you're down with the Dogg, I know you're fucking with this
Don't stop, won't stop, this is all I know
From the uprock to the crack rock in the bowl
Don't stop getting money, bring that shit back
Don't stop, fuck a cop for all the times I was jacked
Can't say much now 'cause I'm moving a crowd
I'm moving real weight, I mean hundreds of thous
Hundreds of pounds, green leaves
I made it out the motherfucking mean streets
And I still go back and touch the youth
I teach 'em how to ball and I teach 'em how to shoot
In the pursuit of my dreams, while recruiting my team
Teach 'em how to rise to the top just like cream
Remain supreme by any means

So um, leave that back door open so a nigga can come in there real slow.

Baby girl, baby boy, that's the way of the world
It ain't got back, can't get back
You say it won't get back, shit I hope it don't get back
I'm creepin' with you, sleepin' with you
It's gettin' bad on a nigga, now I'm beepin you too
And meet me at the hot spot and work that skirt
You know the blue one, the new one, girl you know the truth hurt
Heart beatin' while I'm cheatin', trying to catch a nut
Bad little bitch got a nigga caught up
I'm slidin in the rag top Chevorlet
Got a nigga all out of bounds in West L.A.
I'm tryin' to find your granny's house, is your auntie house
Well um, you know we sorta kinda burn it out
You know I turn it out whenever I'm in the mix

Better be careful cause your girls wanna come too
Yay kiss and a rub back and now I'm up in you
And did you tell Tamika
I was wondering why my homie baby momma was blowing up my beeper
You's a cold thang, I told you keep it on the DL
And if I decide to hit it again it's at the motel
Tellin' them broads about my furniture and jewels
Work on my table and how holding my clientel

Now I got to keep my fuckin' woman from around that hoe
Take a fuckin' rubber everywhere that I go
Keep her from her family cause her cousin know
She say she fuckin' Nate but she can't prove it though
Next time you can't come if you got a loud tongue
I know I got a big dick, shouldn't loaned it to a trick
This time you act like a nigga who just did a crime
You got your ass busted now you facing time
The money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side
But nigga you was with it so when you be quiet
Now you facin twenty all by yourself

Even though this story is a fairy tail
Act like you that nigga bitch and please don't tell

Verse one:(dat nigga daz)
Yeah
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business, racketeerin
Smugglin, doin' things from handin a gun, is what they fearin
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations, spots where it takes place
If you show them my money, your ass is gettin' f-laid
There's four major games that run the city of G's
The violators, the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thang in the city
Where you gotta plot chips, jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay, the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck 'em till they all drop, circle round the block
Let 'em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass, commence to takin' them out!
INTERLUDE:(DAZ talking)
Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs, dope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
Youth behaviour is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
Have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
From coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
Of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion
Verse two:(tray dee)
I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin' it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet makin' it pop
Young crook keepin' hook, nigga, shakin the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for help, you help yourself 'cause there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hos
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trust, bust, be aware and I ain't ya curse
'Cause the niggas that I dared to (?agank?) the first
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Don't speak on the creep, mo' fools is listenin
And war story glory ain't worth the riskin
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set, till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee, nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I'm takin' 'em out!
INTERLUDE:(Corleone talking some more)
Verse three:(snoop dogg)
I come through blastin, me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashin, may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot 'em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate, who's the baddest?
In my zone, Don Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the U-S-C, I shift ki's, a 120 plane rides
Multiplied by G's,87.3 million in a matter o'months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate, new empire to make
Toast till we all die, till we burst and break
From knives to guns, from the rich to the slums
We ran outta dope, I don't think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick 'em off like darts
Stab 'em in they hearts
Make an example, what I said, ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myself, me my dope, me and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judges, I budge when I buzz
I got the City of Long Beach goin' crazy for drugs

We in the zone bombed out feelin' good j'ya know
Got the homegirls and homies from the hood j'ya know
2-1, 1-9, 2-0
We all in the house and it's a Long Beach thang
Where I was born and hungout
To all my players and hustlers and gangbangers listen up
It's about time I kick a rhyme to fuck shit up
Now who throws shit?
(Nate Dogg)
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody... No one does it better
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody... No one does it better
(Snoop Dogg)
Now do the gangstas run this motherfucka? (Hell Yeah!)

Now the party is bumpin', thumpin' back to back
And Daz on the turntable puttin' down a scratch
I'm on the mic so I'ma bust me a rap
And I'm a dedicate this one to a crack of hoodrats
The Dogg Pound nation Lex and Big Pac-sy
These is the peoples I see rockin' the party
Ever they go gonna pop-lock on the flo'
Well do the Boogaloo shrimp and pimp the ho
I got to owe em' my life 'cause I'm a O.G.
I got the love in the hood 'cause I'm livin' homie
I got the seals when it comes to rockin' rhymes
So put ya fists up to the side it's yours I got mines
Now everything is live don't you agree?
And if you do then he gon' move it with the nigga D-O-Double G
We ridin' with the hat to the side when we ride
Y'all know how we do on the Eastside
You see this thing is we like to keep it harder
And for real party people just like Afro Pimp and Wadda
What do you want?
Matter fact what do you need?
'Cause we keep it all on point from the drank to the joint
So pass the bottle ain't no need to squabble
And hand it to the little homie let him have a swallow
It's a Eastside thang nigga bring yo ass
G's up Ho's down nigga you know the program
(Nate Dogg)
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody... No one does it better
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody... No one does it better
(Snoop Dogg)
(So watch ya clock)
The clock tickin'
But it won't stop tickin' 'cause everybody kickin' it
We gettin' at the bitches, witches
The main thing gangstas do
Skip the bump 'cause the rumps what I came to view
New pussy in the hood shall I kill it? (Kill It!)
The way she got it poppin' oh its probably hotter than a skillet
But baby don't tweek like you ain't no freak
Peep I keep my game tight it ain't no leaks so we
Can keep this on the down low
And take a walk with the dog and lemme show you what the pound for
Candle lightin romancin'
If I can just get the last dance in
(Nate Dogg)
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody... No one does it better
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody... No one does it better
No one throws a Eastside party like we do

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground
(Snoop Dogg - Verse 1)
Sippin? yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a n-gga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
Cause my corner back every thing the Don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err?y day, err?y night till I'm carried home
Forever known, big ballin?, try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net
And I ain't knocking a n-ggas hustle, it's all a game
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin', bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back

Live it like I'm talkin'?
Flow so straight but wont a n-gga try and?
I'm so high, yeah the weed, I'm still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like Parkinsons
Breads in the bag, call it good marketing
Life's a bitch but I don't cartigan?
That's what a word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee's I'm tougher than leather
Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever

Only God knows how long the Dogg has
Cause like time we all pass
So if you ever taste success, just pray it's from a tall glass

Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win

Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can't take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I'm an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Its Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic what's happening
Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I would?nt have so many imaginary friends
I'm spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain't finna change, so we won't agree again
Till then I'll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now

No, Snoop can do what he wanna do

Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness
And there ain't no doubt about it
Regarded as the freshest, by the way that I live
All the songs that I did, and givin' back to the kids
I mean I done been everywhere that you wanna go
And poppin' on a stick like a pogo
My logo, is similar to the bat sign
Way up in the sky, When you wanna get high

Addicted to the things I do, magic
Go go go but no gadget, I'm magic

Then you probably wouldn't even know how to represent it
I'm in it like I spread it, if I said it, All gas unleaded
For really though, I get that real hood love everywhere I go
From mommas, babies, grannies
You gotta love him even if you can't stand him

And tryin' ta be hard and tryin' ta be big willies or whatever they call it

I ain't lettin nothin' leak 'cause if thangs leak, then I'm get caught
And I can't get caught 'cause you know how they do it about that child support
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
Gettin' 18-point-5 percent, half your life

Got invited to our annual pajama party
Workin that lace

Sliding it real smooth
Like with a little butter
Cause it getcha in the mood like
Zoom boom hit that boom boom
Right just to getcha groove right
I can make it happen
But it can't happen if you ain't good at it
When you gonna let a nigger have a look at it

Come here, sit on my lap.
(Okay.)
Check it out.
Great scotts, it's hot today
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air
His vision gettin' blurry but you know I didn't care
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck
Shooting like a muthafuckin vietnam vet
Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots
On the hood gettin' hot, anybody can drop
You better have a spot up in town my nigga
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat
Grease strikes you out with no get back
Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me
We can ride on some niggas for nothin' at all
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em
LBC in this muthafucka 'cause
I had to show these niggas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip
Or better yet, strapped a clip
To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater
And put the ride down out of G two seater
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this skandelous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game nigga
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cut throat on the downlow
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him 'cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight"

Foamin at the mouth and waggin his tail
Searchin through the yards with a keen sense of smell
Lookin' for the business in heat
And when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat
We travel in packs and we do it from the back
How else can you get to the booty?
We do it Doggystyle, all the while we do it Doggystyle
Yo motherfuckin hoes!
He fucked the fleas off a bitch
He shaked the ticks off his dick
And in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin bone
And if there's any left over
He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home
Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin' to a nigga

Layin everybody down for diamond rings and chains
It remains the same in the year you live in, see
'Cause if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
When it's time to duel, you get two men
Two heaters, one street, one clock
And when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue
But if you're too slow
I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)
Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real
I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang
The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit
You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slippin through Texas
We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes
Bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen
Searchin for this location on the map
The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)
It feels just like it's 1865
And a trigger look-a-day is how I ride
(Kurupt)
On and on and on it's more strange
Time to heat, shootin range
Quick with the heat on their hip
Young Jesse James come to test your aim
I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral
I hearda ya name
Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie
Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
Back to the drawin down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive through all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map
(The gold rush)
(???? From LBC Crew)
Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots
I got the six shots for all the plans and plots
I gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags
Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags
I got stacks so my stacks excel
Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells
I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse
A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course
It ain't no stoppin' young Josey
Box all the nosey
Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be
Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell
Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele
Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet
Divide between my homies and ride the sunset
(Bad Azz from LBC Crew)
Two sacks o' money from the train heist
They ain't even counted it up
Just mounted it up
Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster
Pass through a run-down town whose walls hold my poster
Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat
So I gotta have what I can get
Heard word about the gold rush and headed West
On my white horsey with three straps in my napsack
Giddy up, the next town I rode through
I had to threaten to blow their city up
Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west
Sell us some beads and hail us some weed
He offered me a toke
He didn't have a twin he had that peace-pipe smoke
I almost choked
Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset
Tryin' ta reach my destiny fast
It's these two bags o' cash
44's cocked I ain't makin' no mo' stops
Till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot
I slid off my boots, counted my loot
Five minutes after the strike of midnight
I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight

Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
But I play hoes like Plenty Lenny 'cause I get pretty
It's all about game...
'Cause with no game is hard to maintain, for so long man
From Long Beach, California
From Tul-sa, Oklahoma
Tonight boardin' New Orleans from Mississippi
I know you hold the key to unlock the door
From low pro's she rolls with gold thangs, we ridin' fo' sho'
So tell me how much money can one playa make?
And how much ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (ya know)
To the heart you're just gigolo (ya know)
(Kurupt)
I was off in Vallejo
Peelin' hoes like Idaho Potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
Bein' from where I be - D.P.G.
It's manifico, ran into this pretty ass skirt
Mexi con Puerto Rico
Mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'ma approach her like that
And let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone, the place that I call home
Is the world from Philadelphia to Rome
Picture me ey, entrepenuer with my nigga D-A
Rockin' tours and we still young boys
We got bitches, they got some bomb ass lips
She used to put 'em on this bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick
(Nate Dogg)
Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?
Someone wants to score, and get laid by the D-O double-G
Hey girl, what's your name? You wanna go a couple rounds with me?
I told her Nate Dogg is just the same, but she kept screamin' out Snoopy
(Warren G)
What's up baby, my name is Warren
I'm down with the Pound, 'cause I get around
So let me scoop you, swoop you, and take you
Give me a chance, and I'ma break you -
Down - to the very last compound
With my homies from the Dogg Pound
(Snoop Doggy Dogg)
Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no hoe
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The hoe gon' slip away, get away with all your cash
You gots to stay up on your toes when it come to hoes
I bust a brand new hoe at every video
That's on the Pound and the Row, and like the wind blow -
I pass a hoe to my kinfolk - and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin' juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
But before she do me, I blaze up a doobie
Then turn on some Snoopy and uh - heat up jacuzzi
And, later on I just might turn on a movie
So you can regroupie and re-do me, just for Snoopy"

Verse Two:
How many hoes in your motherfuckin group
Wanna take a ride in my 7-8 Coupe, DeVille
Chill, as I take you on a trip
Where them niggaz ride, and slide, you know about the East Side
Niggaz like myself, here to show you where it's at
With my hoes on my side, and my strap on my back
Papers I stack daily, and Death Row is still the label that pays me
But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your hoe, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin grip, and really don't give a sheeit
About nuttin at all, just my Doggs, steppin through the fog
And I'm still gonna fade 'em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many hoes in ninety-four will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin and I be ryhmin
It's me, Snoop D-O-double-G, and I'm climbin
Verse Three:
I come creepin' through the fog with my saggin Dukes
East Side, Long Beach, in a 7-8 Coupe DeBille
I'm rollin' with the G Funk, bumpin in my shit and it don't quit
So drop it on the one motherfucker put together that set
A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin dick
And the Compton niggaz all about to set trip
Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin blunt in your pocket loc
'Cause Doggy Dogg is all about the zig zag smoke
See it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some
But watch the gun by my side
Because it represents me and the motherfuckin East Side
So bow down to the bow wow, cause bow wow
Yippie yo, you can't see my flow
My shit is dope, original, now you know
And can't no hood fuck with Death Rizzow"

I hate water! I can't swim! ah!

Now matter where I go, you got'cha eyes on me,
And everybody sittin' around waitin' on me,
Show us how you do it Uncle Snoopy,
So fluid wit' your technique, y'all niggaz gon' respect me,
Man, I been doin' dis' shit before I even learned how to crawl though,
Gettin' interviewed by mothafuckaz like Geraldo,
And niggaz wanna know if I smoke Newports or Marlboros?
Man, I'm fuckin' wit' dat real shit, nigga can you feel dis'?
I make dat shit for the realest of millions,
While I'm wheelin' and dealin' and feelin' the feelin',
Hmm... and oh what a relief it is,
That Snoop is back in dis mothafucka handlin' his biz,
Takin' care of his kids and makin' hits, oh shit,
There it is again, you never know if your career might flop, fizz
So, stay on your toes and keep a pair wit'cha foes,
And keep a set of new hoes and floatin' and tie da bow,
Fuck these niggaz and peep out Whitey Ro (?),
Somebody told? Well then, somebody gettin' rolled on,
And that's usually how the scenario rolls on,
Baby girl said she wanna keep her clothes on,
She either fuckin' gettin' stole on or gotta stroll home,
Well number one, keep your hand on your gun,
And don't (don't) trust (trust) anyone (anyone, one, one...)
Oh... you can't trust nobody baby... you can't even trust your own Mama!
This is Snoopy Collins... trust no one... especially a bitch...
Or even a bitch-ass nigga... Yo Ha!
T-R-U-S-T in me, I'm sexy but I'm pussy,
The homies in the hood call me Lil' Bo Peep,
And you da type a nigga I been dyin' ta meet,
So Snoopy, what'chu tryin' to do?
Now hold on lil' mama, ain't no reason for me to lie to you,
Now what I'm tryin' to do, and what I'm gon' do,
Is hit this bud, I got a wife at home,
Bitch I ain't lookin' for none, you might got kids for 'cause, or down wit' bud
Pushin' them dubs, look here 'cause,
Lemme tell you how it's gon' be
If I was broke loc, these bitches wouldn't want me
I'm tellin' you the good-god truth, you want proof?
Ask them hoes over there, ""Y'all wanna fuck Snoop?"" (yeah!)
We'll take the money and the game away,
I bet they won't say the same that day,
But it's okay, 'cause I don't trip,
'Cause ""Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks"",
I thought I told you, bitch I'm a soulja,
East side, long beach, gang-bang roller,
From the solar, 'cause this, is it,
Can ya dig it? (I can dig it!)
Jelly Roll pulled a rabbit out his hat,
I pull a strap out my mothafuckin' back (Ah!), 'cause I know it's like dat,
I'm in a meetin' wit' these white folks talkin' bread,
They want a contract on a nigga till I'm dead,
If I don't sign they gon' turn me over to the feds,
They struck me out, now I'm pinch-hittin' for the Reds,
But I'm a Dodger blue, so I gotta keep it true,
I gotta home-run, nigga we long gone,
I'm realizin', justizin', visualizin',
Rip-ridin', put mines in,
Takin' this game to the next level,
Trustin' no one, especially them Red Devils,
Keep ya head level, hand on my get-up,
Stay on the red-up, pimpin' ain't easy, but there's a whole lot of fed-up,
And like I told you from the get-go, don't trust no one (no one, no one),
And like I told you from the getti, don't trust no one...
(Alien)
Oh no! you did it again! put me down!

I shouldn't have trusted you! I put all of my trust in you!

Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smoking, I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny, on how shit be
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a niggas just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here, dog, a ho once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it
With rich niggas, nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop, niggas of rap
And when we get to spittin', make sure y'all step back
You with that? 'Cause if you ain't clown
We from the D-O double G, we groupie true and slow down
(Verse 2: Mia X)
Ayyo Snoop, I used to kick up dope, ride with niggas
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping, hit the club, and then start come by
I never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age but they call me mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed
And then I, dropped to my knees and called on the Lord
Please change my ways 'cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild?
Damn I had to slow down
(Verse 3: Mia X)
Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records
For my come up from sun up to sun down
I'm trying to get my money
Haters ain't gon' stop me cause haters can't run me
It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Everybody seemed glad but now they mad
'Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And feds can't take shit from me, so slow down
(Verse 4: Snoop Dogg)
I got niggas, shot niggas, drop niggas for fun
I swap from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the 90's and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump
You don't wanna get caught up in the mix
'Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch
We don't, never ever, talk no shit
Unless we back that shit up, nigga you get lit
Slow down I can't take the heat
Slow your roll, tuck your heat and watch the haters
Slow down I can't take the heat
Slow your roll, tuck your heat and watch the haters"

I love my momma (now you tell 'em Snoop)
You taught me how to read and write, how to fight
My do's and don'ts, my wills and my wont's
I'll never forget, the things that we went through
Bangin' oldies in the livin' room, sippin brew
Schlitz Malt Liquor was the thing back then
My momma was my homey my daddy, and my best friend
Ask the Twinz, them my lil locos to the end
And Warren G and Nate Dogg, shit them my true friends
Time and time again, I'ma spit this rhyme again
She the queen in my life, and I'ma make sure she gon' shine again
She taught me everythang, but she didn't charge a fee
She taught me everythang, except how to see a G
For the nine months you carried, I hope you bury me
Instead of the other way around, and I put that on Dogg Pound
I made you cry, you made me smile
I just wanna say I love you for life
And that's the reason why I'm here now
Love, Snoop
I love my momma, yeah...
I love my momma [I love you momma]
Yeah, I love my momma [I love you momma]
Through all the drama, yeah, yo, yeah, I love you [I love you]
Momma, momma, momma, momma, I love my momma
Momma, I love you momma
I love you momma
Momma, momma
(Singer)
Your money wasn't always long (fo' sho')
But your heart was forever strong (momma... momma..)
You taught me bout faith and hope
And never ever get hooked on dope
Momma... (I love you, I love you momma)
I love you momma... (throught all the drama, I love my momma)

(Snoop)
This one right here is dedicated to a lot of famous players out there
That might have been in love before
I know some of you might not think gangstas fall in love (I miss that bitch)
But uh, it's true
If you been in love like I been in love before, you know
It's hard to get with somebody once they gone (I miss that bitch)
It's hard to replace that special someone
When they just up and you know
Dip dive and so socialize
And what we gon do right here (I miss that bitch)
We go'n kick something over this HiTek beat right here
For all the players that lost somebody special
And wonder where she at
E. White kick that shit (I miss that bitch)
(E. White)
I got my eyes wide open
The whole time I'm holding on to hope with you on my mind
It's been a while child, I'm getting down with Dogg
I bet my name all around your wall
Perhaps I went to jail
That left us out of touch
Shoulda shot some mail or something
Ain't no telling where she at now
I be God damn
Baby I really wanna see what you got now
I'm all grown up with my shit together
I don't know if I'mma see you ever
I got a woman and shit, but I must admit this
You at the top of my list
Unforgetable
Fuck with them nigga do
I still miss, there ain't no getting rid of you
But in the mean time I'mma get with cha
Until I get somebody with your hook up Imma hit ya
I miss that bitch
She was a pot of gold
Her body was cold
I don't know where you went
Where did you go (I miss that bitch)
Shopping around looking around
I'm try to see
Where could you be
How could you do this to me (I miss that bitch)
(Snoop)
My momma got mad
I was young when I hooked up with her
One hit and I couldn't stop trippin'
A long lasting relationship
Pass you around, and let my niggas take a hit
I used to break you down just to roll you up
You the real, you never will slow me up
And you was always on my mind
Say no more
I still miss you at times
All of a sudden you lost my interest
I packed it up and set about my business
You used to have a hold on me
Sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me
I kept going to jail and all that
Get out, fuck with you again, I'm right back
I guess I had to learn the hard way baby
I'm leaving you alone cause you driving me crazy (I miss that bitch)
Oh
Mary, mary, mary
Quite contrary
Oh
Every time I think about that girl
Make a nigga wanna have a wet dream
Release some steam
Oh, oh, oh
I miss that bitch"

By dawn's early light
I shine brighter than the stars in the night
And 'bout ready for a fight
Come noon, I've consumed enough juice
To cut loose and throw a mic to the moon
Since I'm the sun, I'll make you one, it's all for fun
I'm torching hot and all the same
From playing war games with Saddam Hussein
Now who's sane? I'm insane, my membrane's on cold-grown
The tempature's rising, to fry the cells in your dome
It might be on, and if you think so, you know me
It's Tech Caponey, the Doggfather's little homey
(Snoop Doggy Dogg)
Ain't that somethin', how I got little homeys now?
I remember when I was just a little bow-wow
Writing for my rep, calling 'fore I step
Now I put niggas in the game just to stay on deck
High profile, but my style low-pro
Top dogg on the Row, Doggystyle C.E.O.
And I blow the best indo, that you know of
So when I'm in your town, dip down, and show love
You know what? What's up? Shit, I'm feeling good now
You better come and get me 'fore I fall into a freestyle
(Technique)
They say, what's a rapper? Well nigga, what's an emcee?
If they don't got the skills, then they don't roll with me
Ain't that the truth?, I'm bulletproof off the roof
I got a mic and a fix, that'll jack you for your tooth
I'm out for rep, but how long will it last?
I'm coming up quick, cause broke niggas need cash
At last, I'm at the top, so I maintain now
Gotta bang now, nigga this Doggystyle
(Snoop Doggy Dogg)
All she ever wanted was a small time, love thang
Got my homey caught up in the dope game, coke game
He so sprung, on top of that he young
He's only thirteen years old, and the world's so cold
He never took the time-out to fall down on his knees
Until he fucked his G, got some keys, now they's enemies
The niggas he grew up with, they put him in the game
Now they 'bout to take him out the game
Man it's a shame, but you know how that shit go
That's life in the fast lane, that's why I roll ??
[Chorus]: Kurupt,(Snoop), <*some singing in the backgound*>
I'd rather not get shot
I'd rather sit in the studio and rock spots
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, we're one big family, it's all DPG (DPG)
I got a G on the best bomb money can buy
I ain't out for no homicides, I'm out to survive
Dogg Pound, Doggystyle, one big family, it's all DPG (DPG)
(Technique)
(Niggas) Niggas and hoes will try to get you twisted
But I'm unlisted in the books
You base your life on that, you might get your life took, BLAOW!
Put me in the game, I'm riding hard till I win
Serve a crew, kill a few niggas, till the end
I mean, I'm a fiend for superior green
And all my life I got advice from a superior team
I gotta stay away from the casket
Don't get blasted, and tell my kids how I lasted
But my crew's mafioso, so my philoso-
Phy is to G to the day that I d-i-e <*echoes*>

Snoop Dogg, smooth and imperial
Wake up every morning to my Lucky Charms cerials
Time's getting drastic, man I'm a flas it
Dogg Pound Gangstas' choking off that boombastic
Have you ever heard?
I'm loose, shook the feds, like the juice, Snoop Dogg is 121st proof
Fool, you's a deuce, Deuce is some Genuine Draft
I'm a genuwine, like ??, and all about cash, cash,
Cash, I got some free, so indeed I gets the lighter for the hash
Has it ever been a time when you didn't have a dime
To your name, and the only way to gain is through crime?
Sometimes I used to pack, one time I got jacked by some sacs
But you know I got mine, you know about the Don Corleone
I'm-a survive and thank God for Lil' Spanky B. and Bone

Black female with chips, from the city?
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends
Good girl - why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)
When I was a kid, growin' up, I never had toys
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up
Shit, she'd take a nigga out
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look
Baby was my thang, nah, she was my low-low
Bought my first Rol-o, and then we took a photo together
Man I hope this thang last forever
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet
She lovin' a nigga, steady buyin me shit
And don't say shit when I dip with my click
And understand, when I'm down and out
May need some help with some chips
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world
Buyin me houseshoes and khaki blues, California curls

Rhythm and Gangsta: The Masterpiece
Such a, heavenly experience
Alchemist, break it down for me nephew
Let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch
(Snoop Dogg)
In the beginning as a child I was chosen
Though not knowin' the reason while still my eyes opened
Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog
Love was given to all, outside livin' the ball
As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message
To reach teachin the masses, I wrote my first passage
It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
I'm young, livin' in the city of jackers and gangbangin
And dope dealin', cold feelin' to be a product of niggaz around you
Once you get on top they down you
But the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin
I found myself grindin on the streets quite often
With a blue rag, bangin' the dub, fo'-fifth coffin
At the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the Eastside
Where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the G-ride
Niggaz throwin' up hands but it wasn't no peace signs
Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine
Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messin up
Disrespectin my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin'
And then I found out that mom wasn't playin'
Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand
Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man
Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
Through the stripes still gotta shine my light
I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg
Just a block and a phone call away
I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist
I'm preachin just what I practice
To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to acros the globe
Man woman young and old
Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light 'cause I love you
(Singers - repeat in background of Outro w/ ad libs)
(I love, to give you light)
(Outro: Minister)
And the people that is locked up, locked down
And the people that's locked dowwwwwn
Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade
On 24's, with the spinnin thangs, ha ha
I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors
Cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin' to heaven huh
And you ain't gon' go!
So I need you right now to, look at your neighbor
And say neighbor, say NEIGH-BOR, YOU AIN'T GOIN'!
You ain't goin'!"

And what I'm making make a nigga make a million dollars later

Motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Even if I die, living Legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend
Look, big dog, six broads, don't matter to me
You new niggas look madder than me
Came up with the Doc, been around the world with 'Pac
Don't compare another rapper to me
When I came and kicked them buildings over
Swear I always knew I'd never be the same
Was born to be a motherfucking legend
I ain't never do it for no fucking fame
Motherfucking legend
You know what I'm repping
20 million, 20 years ago
Cuh, you was like 7
You ain't gotta like it
Bitch you gon' respect it (Respek on my name)
Look me in my eye
Motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Even if I die, living Legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Used to whip a Lexus
I can die right now, still a legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Born to be a legend
A motherfucking legend
Mix purple with the yella
Kobe with Vanessa
Did it doggy style
Like upon the dresser
Look at my reflection
Motherfucking legend
Even when I die"

Two step wit me, let's slip to the dance floor
On and on and on and on we go
I'll dip you if you want me to
You see I really wanna get a little front wit you, bigidy bump wit you
A nigga wanna hump you and then just comfort you
And then I'll pop the top and lay you on the cot, and get you nice and hot

With the S-N double O-P D-O double G-Y
Now don't ask why, just keep looking good in the hood
Damn girl, you so fly! We could do what you want to
You say you drink Alize or was is it Malibu? It don't really matter though
You remind me of the time when I had a hoe
She kept telling me Doggy Dogg I gotta go
So I let her get in the wind and co-macked her friend
2 plus 2, it equals 4, this is some shit that could last forever more
I'm trying to put my bid in, naw I'm just kidding
Come on ma get in, and don't ask where we going
Pimping and hoeing, drink pouring and weed blowing, you know it c'mon!

I've been looking at you, from the corner of my eyes
Checking out your hips, lips, tits and your thighs
I've been wanting to do you, for a mighty long time
You make a pimp wanna sing I - I - I
We'll head to the hills, your dreams I'll fulfill
We could do it how you want, 'cause I'm oh so real
Tell me you, naw I won't squeal
You wit Da Big Bo$$ Dogg so seal the deal
Pharrell got the Babyface and Dogg got the Whip Appeal, so name the place
This love I bring to you, on the real baby girl
Won't you do me a favor and sing for Snoop

Used Oil of Olay, 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my white sox, with my all blue chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my indo
Then I dilly [dally] I ran through an [alley]
I bumped into this smoker named [Sally] from the [Valley]
This was a girl playin' hard to get
So I said ""What's wrong?"" 'cause she looked upset
She said um"

Ehehe, oh really?

Hoe get up out my face unless you tryin' to fuck
Cause on the real a nigga kinda drunk
And right now the way you lookin' bitch you fly as fuck
I don't even know if I done had too much
You play too much, I had to fuck
Cuddled you up and put my hands on your butt
Rubbin your stuff and now your pants full of nut
... You can't tell me nuttin
Let me shoot my thang on your bellybutton
I got to, keep it gangsta
Your homegirl want some, I just might bank her
Shank her, bank her, and take her bankroll
Big Snoop Dogg and my game is way cold
Never, ever, overexpose
I usually got a car with a room full of hizzoes
Snoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly
Can I give you a little piece of the pie?
Shake it, bake this thing for me
Cause you just flow so viciously
Soopa-Duper, you so fly

Open up your eyes you'll see my navel
Flip down my drawers, you'll see that label
Sniffed so much 'caine/Kane, the bitch got able/Abel
Put the switch on, directed my cable
Splash! What head work and what ass
Bitch stop my dick hurtin', now fuck Daz
Run fast if I tell ya bitch walk

Only on the TV when I blow kisses at him, muah
Listen here madam, you can throw the pussy at him
If it ain't about snatch, well it just won't happen
... Hov ain't into backwards mackin
... How backwards that is
... I don't love 'em though
'Less makin' a little paper then I love 'em the most
If she's, sneakin in the club with the toast
I'm flyin the friendly skies with 36 hoes
Shit, I can get a chef to cook for me
Talk about some paper if you tryin' to book me
Ma, you can keep your head

Feels like I'm losin control, and I don't even know

I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
I was in love at times
I was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
Now who would ever think that I wanted a home
Three kids and a wife, never be alone
A dog in the front yard and that picket fence
Havin' somethin' on the side? It didn't make sense
(Butch) I'm a family man sportin a weddin band
(Soopafly)
I heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn
I gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you
The other twenty was cool, 'cause we gon' make it through
(Butch) The homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in
(Soopafly)
I told that nigga like Chris Tucker,
""Don't worry about what the FUCK I be doin'""
We was makin' chemistry, but who is he?
And how dis nigga know the deal about you and me?
(Butch) I fell to my knees and asked the girl ""Why?""

Well the game better wait for me
I'm spendin my time while I'm writin these rhymes
In the Hills for real, sippin wines, girl you'se a dime
Got me losin my mind
Well if lovin' you is a crime
I'm down to do my time
Lock me up and throw away the key
I once told that ""This was the way love was meant to be""
I see you with me forever
We can do things that you never, thought you coulda
Up out the hood-uh, is where I took you, never overlooked you
I can't believe that you shook to another spot
And left me cold, now I'm hot
I'm tryin' to find you, what am I to do?
I gave you everything that you needed

Took it for granted, shit, I'm cool now

How could, how could, you do me wrong?
You be messin up my songs (my songs)

Every time I'm with her
I get her hoo, I get her hoo, luv drunk
Every time she's with
She in me, luv drunk
You know who I am, I'm the mothafuckin' dogg
The sheets fucked up and you know it was me
You hit a bedspreak all way down the street
It sounds like a song we fuckin' to the beat
I put ma rat-tat-tat in her boom boom pow
Then she put her tit-tit-tit all up in my mouth
I told you before I don't luv them ho's
But she got that good, good, can't let her go
And I gotta let her know
Every time I'm with her
I get her hoo, I get her hoo, luv drunk
Every time she's with
She in me, luv drunk
She make me say good luv that's what she's feelin' fo'
And I got that fire luvin, the more you need the more ooh
Lemme say ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Every time she's with me, me I'm dizzy
Shoot to the spot 'cause the spot is the lick
Pull your lunch break, lemme hit it real quick
Back to your job before they know what is
Luvin' so good, we already made three kids
I don't know what it is but I luv what I did
Huggin' and touchin' and all that shit
Drink to your drunk, see my luv is a fill
Yeah, this for you boo it's a gift
Every time I'm with her

161,May I,2000,Dead Man Walkin' (2000),Hip Hop,Snoop Dogg,"Now... who got the beat that makes ya bump?
And who got the bump that ya thump?
Well, I got the funk that makes ya bump
So we gon funk this motherfucker right on up
Well here's a toast to the boogie while I step on in
So put your lighters in the air and let the smoke kick in
I got the motion, the potion
And once ?? hit the groove everything is in motion
We coastin through the neighborhood and lookin' around
And all of my homies on lock down, we keep it underground
Man, I done found the only way to put mine down is to dip, skip with the homies from the Dogg Pound
Sup, Bow-Wow, how my nigga feelin'?
Oh, I'm on the money mission to get a pocket full of millions
Like Sicilians, we do it mafioso
Doggy style, Dogg Pound, Death Row is the logo
I do it by my lonely 'cause I'm true to the code
Plus I die with the homies cause that's all I really know
Who started with me, who departed with me
Through thick and thin we heartless-ass G's
Regardless, let's see with biphocles, let's try the locals
And y'all wonder why they despise my vocals
I fooled you like crystals, rap spittin' like lips do
When I dismiss you, me and my click, fool
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
(Repeat x4)
To be a high rolla, you need a pistola
And about a half a key of some Coca-Cola
Now that I got older, I got a little colder
And I don't trip to get a chip off my nigga's shoulder
Million dreams of a gangsta, being like Cagney
A bowlie for Snoop Doggy
Ain't no follow-up, man, I'm a general, so when I put it down I gots to be so orignal
I'm quick to bust, just like Daz Dillinger
But that's the little homie, I'm the big homie, Snoop Don Corleone
Spit three words up in lightning
As long as I'm bouncin' with this I know you like it
Fo' sho tho, you can't take my fo-do'
I'm layin around in the DPG in a grey photo
Get pushed around downtown in the back of a car
The Double R from the Durwood store
Well in verse three, the worst see?
After part two, know when I stop the clock there be a heart, too
And just the two of us, gonna show you how we do,
I thought you knew we bust
I demolish, stay polished, no time to rust
No dividing, multiplying 'cause it's never too much, like Luthor
Cause ya see ain't no loser
That can get the scoop on the supa-dupa Snoop
I refuse the tactics, you ain't used to drastics
I choose to mash like Land Cruisers
You know I isn't the bomb digga-dee, bomb-beeze
They can't get with the D-O double G
You no MC slash master of ceramonies
Runnin' thangs, pullin strings callin Snoop pesky
Lesson, blessin', stressin' manifest me
Don't wanna test me, I'm guaranteed to let it rest, see?
May I?"

Midnight love
Troubles plots on thee mind
Midnight love
Leave your back door open
Midnight love
This heaven's ready for me
Midnight love
Back door little druggie's callin for you
(Snoop)
I'm makin' things cappin fast
Ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along
Face lookin' stupid broke startin
Feelin' dumb, I'm young but I'm a grown man
Takin' thangs into my own hands
I'm tryin' to own here
But life a twist ya like a twister
Get twisted with this
It seems on but its off
I keep missin' this shit
I'm high but I try, to stay focused wide out
Lookin' dead at the chips
I blink they dip
Its hard to hang on but I can't let go
Smokin' on my last breath
Blow out life what's left is death
Now I can go on or I can G or make a right
Whatever way that I turn its still death after life
It don't discourage me, I ain't got nothin' to lose
But some punks that probably never turn the money to burn
But I learn 'cause I see, and I earn 'cause I G
But these problems probably havin' niggaz prayin' to see
At an early age so at an early stage in life
I chose to get my ish tight ya gotta struggle and fight
It cost an arm and a leg just to live on your knees
And I'm tryin' to keep my sanity God help me please
Mischeavius and devious is how my life was
Puttin' the serve down for cabbage just to keep the niggaz buzzed
Some of the money makin' muthafuckaz from the other side
Was thinkin' about a jack move tryin' to whoo-ride
Gettin' jealous 'cause my music got this rap game sewn up
Them niggaz wanna trip whatever back they get blowed up
Blown up or not you can still get shot
You don't never play those muthafuckaz I'll always not
Rule number one, pay attention to this shit
Don't be fuckin' wit my niggaz on the midnight shift
Shit shiggy shack, gettin' it on, to the break of dawn
Now he's known for servin' more than an oz. so
He's got a 187 on his muthafuckin chest
A strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
He's lookin' for the music from the night before
Trouble 1, he layin low all in gettin' that dough
(Daz)
Now it's all about the dollars
Impalas that bounce
Havin' cars and bitches on a proper amount
Caught a million chillin'
Robbin banks for many muthaz son
Life and darkness
We all get it started, cold hearted
All around it my life won't change for the good
As soon as I walk out the door, I'm called by the hood
Daz, would you come and ride for me,
Hey yo Daz would you soldier would you would you and die for me
The tradition's got a lot of niggaz killin' for dumb shit
The OGs think then brung guns to control shit
Every midnight I be loaded, high as a kite
Besides with the drama the dog fight street fight
And a lot a mob puttin' on mo
Problems solved, but revolved whatever with a fo-fo
But sure I did the record blast five times
254 sentence to jail time
Midnight love
I've been walkin' the street
Midnight love
I put my life on the line
Midnight love
'Cause I've just gotta be me
Midnight love"

Being black is like being in the yang

But when your black tryin' to get green,
It's hectic, know what I'm mean?

But niggas is niggas, and I can't put it no other -

Niggas is the same all throughout the USA
I been around the world, and I came on back home
And niggas is the same, they always try to get ya boy
They like dogs, squabblin, tryin' to get yours
But if you ain't gone open it, they knock down the doors
They gone take what they get, gonna get what they take
And if you gone be fake, check that shit from the gate
If you afraid of the dark, then stay out the alley
They got blacks being blacks way out in the valley
I used to be afraid, like to be shook up
'Cause niggas like you always leave the game hooked up
Tryna get yours, but you gone get it too fast
'Cause I'ma tell ya, watch them niggas,
'Cause them black ass niggas on the move in the mash boy
And niggas don't care 'cause they out for cash and they know
If they catch you slippin, they gettin' you and gettin' away
Its part of the pay, its part of the day, they do it they way
And if you black it goes on like ev-er-y-day
I don't know black on black, black for black
But blacks take off on blacks
Blacks need to realize and wake up
And see we all one color, all one game
You my sister, you my brother
So you my daddy, or you my mother
I don't know but I know we all realated
And if we stay down there's no way that they can fade it
But that's just a game piece from me to y'all
But if black on black gone continue to brawl
Then black gone fall, then black knah
Y'all better wake up and check out the black Dogg

Fuck around and get molly whopped in here,
Better not attract no cops
I got another round chopped up in here,
Who want what I got in stock?
Not from Atlanta but I got heart

Heavy weights exhale, 5 star hotels

Trying to increase my profit quick

Got on and I brought the whole Pound with me
Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way too G
Niggaz knew it was Eastside L.B.C.
Gangsta shit, that's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get
The one up above didn't like my pace
I was movin' too fast and I caught that case
I fought that case, wonder where the West would be if I'da lost that case
I slow mine down, swimmin' with the sharks and I almost drowned
I done made some mistakes along the way
To become the G I am today
Who had ever thought I'd make this far?
Out the hood to be a big star
And I ain't goin' nowhere
Homie I ain't never comin' down
I'm too high in the clouds
To ever have to worry 'bout that

Said I wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead
Switched sides, now my old boss want me dead

Crying and saying to leave him alone
But I'm not leaving his side

Some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim
It is the shooter that picks them
They just can't wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didn't listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shayne and Josh

I been getting high for the last what 15 20 years
So I told myself I wanna know what it feels like to be high fo life
And I mean man I tell ya it feels real good
You know coaching them lil kids out there on the football field
Doing my thug thizzle still but you know
Just being high for life is a different feeling
You should try it my brother I'm telling you it's a great feeling
Can you dig that
I can dig it
More and more you grieve
(Sing that song nephew)
Until you grow another need
You claim this fantasy
You'll have no reality
Darling take a listen
This may be something that your missin'
I know your times are funky
But you don't have to be no junkie"
175,Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang,2001,Death Row's Snoop Doggy Dogg At His Best (2001),Hip Hop,Snoop Dogg,"One, two, three, and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
('Cause you know we're about to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'mma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earning her man
And learning her man and at the same time burning her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
(Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom)
Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beeping
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
(So just chill till the next episode)
Falling back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean
Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N-double O-P
D-O-double G-Y, D-O-double G, ya see
Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah)
So Dre (What up Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumping, city of Compton
Is where it takes place so when asked, your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip 'cause if I slip then I'm slipping
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping
And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Putting the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better
Like this, that, this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?

In the world of change, here I am
Tryin' to have some thangs
So what you need is some game, to get your money man
Oh baby, in the world of paper, paper
(Snoop Dogg)
Thinkin' of a master plan
Cause ain't nuttin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still comin' up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin' how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin funny
Stop smilin', cause still don't nuttin move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin this
Feelin' out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thang
But without no money man that shit's a dream
'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, 'cause I'm paid in full (*echoes*)

If you run up, you gettin' done up, I love to floss
Why you acting bad, probably 'cause I'm know as the bad actor
In the rap game I'm the big factor, macker, smack a bitch in a second
The big dogg nigga very well respected
You gotta put your mash down when you wanna get to the top
The game is stuffy like Puffy don't stop
I thought I told ya, nigga I'm a soldier
No Limit Lieutenant, yeah I did it
I'm committed like a motherfucker supposed to be
Won't let no bitch niggaz close to me
From my head to my feet I'm protected from harm
'Cause I'm a muthafucking shining star, you feel me

I'm not Keith Murray but I'll Get Ya Lifted
Terrific, cause this is just the linguistics
This shit's cannibalistic, so I mixed it and twisted
With the berries and cherries, the high berries
The aura is horror, man this shit is so scary!
I took another hit and then my vision got blurry
I had to pass this shit in a motherfucking hurry
I'm looking at this chick, real thick, her name is Cheri
Big fat booty and her pootie was hairy, c'mon biatch!

Fronted a hundred to my nigga 'cause he want to get blunted
Ain't nothing to it, but to do it so I did it 'cause I'm wit it
This is the Face Off, the one hitter quitter
It'll lay you on your back fast, sweat start to trickle
Everything is moving like you on a tricycle
You caught up in the pickle but I get you out
I blow you a charge through your nose, not your mouth
Slow down! hoe damn! you're doing too much
You're supposed to take two puffs then give the shit up, c'mon!

Well, like Jesus I fasted, for 40 days and 40 nights
I got it all mastered
Now I need a hit of that, Neptune-ology
Gangsta philosophy, yep yep I gotta be
Real high, whenever writing my novelty
Because it adds to my celebrity
So I celebrated, teledated, innovated, dominated
Orchestrated, situated, petuated, reinstated
Then I created, you're happy that I made it
Take another hit, young nigga get faded
We're going all out, smoke till ya fall out

Wings are under all your clothes
You worth more than your weight in gold
Where did God put down your mole
Or were you only made for show?
Girl you're perrr-feeeect - when God made you
I wonder if he kept the mold, or are you just for show?
Girl you're perrr-feeeect - when I see you
It takes my mind to cloud nine, girl you're so fine, yeah - hey

And the word is on the streets, and the word is the streets
We gon go to a live remote, licking wit my main man Mr Doggy Dogg
(Snoop Dogg)
A day in the life, of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stuburn type of fella with a head like a brick
And just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's smooth as a prism
Now check it as I kick off in this funky ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg ain't this y'all
I got couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Reel, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face
And the homie Har'ron rest in peace
Big Jay from Cappinella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big neck bone
Mausberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein jealous of what I does
'Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast
In the paint playin' post - I back you down
Like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up, bust ya boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't +Pull My Hoe Card+
... I fucked all your groupies
When you was doin' time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was payin' niggaz off with all my riches
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?
Oh I know (bitch!)
But I walk the mainline every time I go down
You can check my G files I do it L.B.C. style
... I got the word on your Simon
You need to just start rhymin
Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggaz just crumbs off my table
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for ""1-8-7 on a cop""
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
If you keep talkin' shit on Crip!
(Hook 1: repeat 2X)
It all boils down to the fact
That you're jealous of my paper stack (jealous ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact
That you're jealous of my paper stack (gon get pimp slapped)
(Hook 2: repeat 2X)
Money, I get it, paper I got it
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em
(Snoop Dogg)
If I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous
And I'll be spending money out the anus
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level
Man you worser than devils
Alotta niggas should've said it, fuck em
But Ima say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life
And I'ma let the whole world see
'Cause you fucked up the industry, and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up
'Cause I'll fuck every last one of 'em up, especially Kurupt
See that's my lil homeboy, so he knows what's up
He better keep it Crippin, and slip his clip in
'Cause these niggas trippin', this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected diss directed, sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it
It's all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy Dibby Double in the hood again
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it
So put the bacon in the skillet, and try to peel it
Cause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga
Money, I get it, paper I got it
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got em

But know the deal you better flip her like a somersault
Snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for
Never called somebody friend that I wouldn't kill for

I pop 'cause I'm the man
Now watch me and Kells

I got pimping in my veins
Pimping in my blood
Pimping in my swag

Walking like a pimp when I walking through the club
Pause like a pimp so the hoes show me love
Pimp by day, pimp by night
Pimp haters make me keep my pimp game tight
See y'all type of fools make a nigga want thug
Like shots of patron make a nigga want fuck
But I ain't on that shit so I'mma throw my hands up
And keep it sexy pimping cause that's how I does

Yo hating motherfuckers, I'm still here

Let the motion of your body be the key, 'cause we
Be the motherfuckin G Funk family
Now, I'll play the G in this deadly game
Snoop Dogg is the name Dogg Pound's the game
If it ain't one thing it's a motherfuckin nother
Word to my granny and my daddy, and my mother
Whether standin on the corner, or bouncin' in the six-deuce
When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose
'Cause back in the days, on the side where it's at
A nigga had to have a fat stack
And I was a fool, don't make me have to grab my strap and go
Rat-tat-tat-tat, nigga slap to a motherfucker face he fall
Can't none of y'all niggaz see the Doggy Dogg
'Cause I'm one rude bwoy comin' with the wickedness
So shut the fuck up, and listen while I'm kickin this
Chorus: (repeat 2X)
Blam blam, blam to dem all
Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump)
Verse Two: Snoop
Now you can look to the Sun, and spot the moon
And see Snoop Doggy Dogg step into the room
With the G funk, he funk, she funk, we funk
Follow me, follow me, listen to the words that a nigga...
I come down with the wickedness
One rude bwoy comin' with the darkness (blam!)
Close your eyes 'cause you can't see me
I quit school cause of recess you fuckin' B.G.
I'm shakin up the party, like Lodi Dodi
Is he the dopest? Ya betta ask somebody
When, then, send, some gin
And a pack of zig zags now let the games begin
In nineteen-motherfuckin-ninety-three
I'm fuckin' up every nigga known in the indistry
Check this out, it's a Dogg Pound thang
You know who I am you know my motherfuckin name, who am I?
(The S-N-Double-O-P) nickname (Silky Smell) last name (D-O-double-G)
The behavior and the flavor that I found
Makes me wanna hit that ass up with the Dogg Pound
Verse Three: Malik
Now just back up, don't act up, I pack up much heat
Any battle I'm in, I win, I can't be beat
Don't sleep while I creep peep out my technique
I forgot, I'm out of sight so you can't see the
MC of the year, you hear and you fear
I got somethin' for them niggaz in the front and the rear
I handle the sides, did a driveby in the who-ride
I'm satisfied now everything is really all right
You know when I come nigga I come wicked
Don't need no permisison, motherfucker I'ma kick it
Niggaz sweat my shit I wet 'em up with the biscuit
Lick 'em up shot, it don't stop, till dem all drop
Make up your mind, go pop or slang rocks
Just stop, rottin on the next niggaz jock

Eastside Long Beach to be exact
(I was raised in the hood)
Where the grass is greener and the crips are much meaner
(We got ya, back, I was raised in the hood)
I'll never turn my back on the hood
(I was raised in the hood)
Yeah you can take me out the hood
But you can't take the hood up outta me
(Snoop Dogg - Verse 1)
Raised by the gangstas, the generals, the thieves, the twins
Yeah I'm stealing n-ggas, please what you know bout that
I do it every time, told 'em 1800 had 'em mixing it with lime (oh weee)
My life is like a movie, I was thuggin' in the beach when I lit my first doobie
In the same city where I got my first piece of coochie
Where I sold my first dime, and I held my first uzi
Bitch, choose me, 'cause I'm going to the top
Rap or the rock, them hoes say I'm on bitch
Whenever will it stop
I was poppin'like it's on, slamming Chevy's up the block
East up, what it do though
Now I ride 2-door, the Porsche looking mean
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a n-ggas still elope
Only 'cause I was raised in the hood
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got ya back
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
I was raised in the hood (the hood, the hood, the hood)
We got ya back
(Snoop Dogg - Verse 2)
Raised by the monsters the criminals
The G's, it was ? the n-ggas on the east
What you know bout that?
Snoopy in his prime, I'm a boss
I catch a n-gga slippin' like moss
Ride with the realest, I've been on it since a young'n
It's 200 bitches in the function
Looking cool, you know it bitchy I'm rollin'
And I ain't worried 'bout them n-ggas we patrolling the hood and the city
Rollin' on that dilly
2 milly, 2 Bugatti's, call 'em Rozay and Diddy
Heart of the set, Homie I'm a vet
Lil nigga, keep ya clothes, ask around,
I'm a rep, East up, what it do though
Hoes spillin' Nuvo, Doggy on his tip
I threw up the two O
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a n-ggas still elope
Only 'cause I was raised in the hood
(Snoop Dogg - Verse 3)
Raised by them hustlas them dealers on the block
It was plenty of them n-ggas on the spot
What you know bout that?
Turned up fully
The hood raised me, gang-banging made me a bully, ya dig
Burnt out and any party we at, you know it's turned out
The people talking the rumours
Now what you heard about?
How I spend 100 thou gettin' purped out
I'm strapped up, I keep a pistol for these suckers tryna act up
They know I'm famous like I won't get in the streets 'cause
Like I don't come from the W, I'm a beast bru
What it do though, dickies for the dulo
Homie, you know skinny n-ggas sumo
Hella far from broke, the 40 won't choke plus a n-ggas still elope

Show me love, and it wasn't no mistakin
That I would dedicate this melody - fuck the hatin'

I had to tell my girl to pack her shit
'Cause she slipped and dipped inside
I need a girl that's ready to ride
To keep the heater right by her side

Aiyyo, so what the deal Dogg, tell me, keep it real Dogg

Finance related, you graduated
To the next level in the game, wearin my name
Bad little brickhouse, go and do that thang

Yo - niggaz surprised when they open they eyes
Thick in the thighs wasn't part of they plan
Not just his bitch, I'm like his main man
Act shifty - your resistance gone swiftly
Bitches mad at a nigga, askin why he kissed me
Stop whinin, just to cry and get the mackin daddy
I don't like it when the angry chick is actin' crabby
That's why he bagged me
Ghetto jewel, never loud and trashy
No stressin over chicks - problem? Bet I solve it fastly
(Snoop Dogg)
We gangbang on these niggaz like we 'posed to do
And I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you
We posted Boo - you, my, one and only
Quick to dump before the homies
Remember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?
You filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love
All that pushin and shovin, kissin' and huggin
Thuggin', dig it, dug-in
I'm lovin' every minute of it Boo
The way you stay true, and always kept your cool
You kept the heater right by your thigh
And when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride
You didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out
That's what I'm talkin' bout, no doubt
Ruff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know
D-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy
(Eve)
Aiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need
Fake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees
Don't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes
And if I heard you was frontin I hope on the case
Wild one? Maybe, but I'ma protect my baby
Test me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy
That's how I do for my Dogg, keep my (?) strong
Both sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song

Niggas think I'm playin' till they smokin' like a muffler
'Bout to take flight, the lane open on you bustas
Catch me if you can in a world full of suckas
Niggas keep simpin', they wanna be Usher
Until they get their eyes and coffin closed by the usher
Them punches won't work, you need mo' muster
Lord lay him down, he need no sufferin', nigga
When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin' at the light
At the light, I got kush in my blood
Sippin' Remy keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the cut
And all the people when they see me like, ""Snoop, turn it up!""
When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin' at the light
At the light, I got kush in my blood
Sippin' Remy keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the cut
And all the people when they see me like, ""Snoop, turn it up!""
Hmm, on my road to riches
I done seen a lot of roaches and bitches
That's why the Dogg keep, goin' the distance
But niggas don't know when to listen, that's why I load ammunition
And stay in touch with my competition, I'm in touch with my composition
Roll a blunt, it's the kush, yeah we got prescriptions
Just a G5, no encryptions
Pick a side, yeah you know we Crip'n
And through my eyes I see the world different
100 G's to record wit him, hit the gas give me more engine
This is somethin' that was born in him
No game for a bitch, just forfeit him
I'm in tune, give me more rhythm
I let the bullets and the swords hit him
All P's like a Porsche emblem
Now make dead with the mortician
Nigga, this Bigg Snoop Dogg you best to listen
Ya heard me?
When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin' at the light
At the light, I got kush in my blood
Sippin' Remy keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the cut
And all the people when they see me like, ""Snoop, turn it up!""

I'm playful but I don't play
Spinnin' the globe like the strobe
Like the club packed, my flow right the whole night
If I plan to go right, a cold night
In hell before I fail, I'm alright
Man, I'm like a flash of lightnin'
Breath of fresh air, classic debonair
Glass of champagne, hold it in my right hand

I got my hands where you'll let me
I love it when you dance, so sexy
I love it when you in that night mood
Slow motion movin' like ain't nothin' like you
I'm feelin' good doin' what I like to
Suited up, pimp stripe, light blue
I let it do what it might do
Fresh and crispy, the rest a mystery

And constantly a nigga catching them cases
With them death situations

I can't reminisce too long
'Cause I'm in a war zone
If I sleep, slip, trip I might get blasted on
So I'm gone mash on home
But on the way I see some of my enemies
And they tripping on me
'Cause I fuck with Master P
But I;m heated, so beat it
And another 87 case, I really don't need it

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck I'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we puttin' in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggaz
Anybody killa, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is
I see some mark brand niggaz on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin', ""Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga snoop all right? Aiyyo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggaz in jail, or are them niggaz through?""
I said, if you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thang, to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggaz know
What's up with you I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
And Compton, and Watts, see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
See long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
Pump pump, put 2 slugs dead in your chest

Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, ooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon 'cause
I drops bombs like Platoon (ay nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
(I won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
Or survival, becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, 'cause you don't wanna be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
Take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
Now roam through the depths of hell
Where the rest your buster ass homeboys dwell
Well...

Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine, that cracks your fuckin' chest plates
Open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruffneck
Now everybody scream nuff respect to the X
Nuff respect given
Disrespect and you will not be livin'

'Cause I'm a do what I'm suppose to do, an what I was choose to do
Wether it's buyin a house, or car, or some clothes for you
I try to stay tru to it, see I ain't new to it
That's why I do for you boo, I need love too, three
Snoop with background chorus -2x-
See I done put it on the line, see this here is genuine
An as long as you with me girl, see everything is gonna be fine
See can't nobody match it, don't touch it, ya might scratch it
This love affiar, it's so original, I call it classic
See I'm attracted, an I'm infacturated
At the same time, belated, an gang related, Dogg Pound on mine
But to fine time to leave all that behind
An tryin' to spend some time an give you all of mine {what's that} ya see
I ain't hard to get along with, to do a song with a nigga like D.J. Pooh
Dedicate this whole thing, to a girl like you, boo, look here
You know I'm true, just continue to do me like you want me to do you
An, I hope we don't never have to, write another chapter
Just keep it on the real wit me
'Cause I don't really wanna, see you on the corner
Just show a nigga love ya see {gets no love, gets no love}

While baking me a cake with a root beer float
Then put the TV on the channel where's it's nothin' but sports
Every room at the house is where I smoke my dope, no joke
Got keys to the spot so I can slide by necessary

225,Snoop's Upside Ya Head,1996,Tha Doggfather (1996),Hip Hop,Snoop Dogg,"I think it's bout' time that we hit these niggas upside
The head with some of that west coast
Gangsta' sh, oh, Wee!

Sewed up
So If you plan on comin' out nigga hold up.
This a stick up
Dick up

And guess who they gon' pick up?
Some niggas think they know they shit
But they don't
Some M-A's escape
Some won't
Bumpin' heads with niggas
Where you from?
East Side Long Beach, nigga, 2-1
The homie just got paroled
And he got more stories than the highway patrol
Tellin' me about the money Suge Knight stole
But I'll make that shit late
'Cause nigga I get swole
Niggas tryin' to get in, to get out.
Put me up on game tellin' me who gon' jack me
But ever since
I was a puppy
Till I was paroled
I never had no other dog pullin' on my chrome.
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Niggas in the game be doin' way too much
Akin' tough with this east-west coast stuff.
See Me
I'm all about my money mane
I stay fly and dry
I don't get caught up in the rain
'Cause game recognize game
No matter where you from
We all can get dumb, insane and
Turn the party out
Without a doubt
Unless
You them niggas who ain't got no clout
LBC and B what?
Uh, my crew
'Cause uh, we out there smokin' on the Krazy Glue
Upside yo' head like oops
Snoop's
The shit, that you hear them bumpin' in the hoops.
Can't afford it
Homeboy
This is finished
I represented
From V-A to Venice
So when it's timid
And cold outside
Rely on the Doggy Dogg
To put the heat in yo' life
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
It takes a whole lot
To be number one
I can't walk down the street
Without my gun
I can't trust these niggas fool
It ain't no fun
I'm sittin' up in court
'Cause somebody got dumped
What really counts is how the crowd bounce
Go home and say
Snoop rocked the parte'
Nobody got kilt
It's what got announced
I guess they got a chance to see Dr. Bombay
But I keep my heat in case niggas get cold
Warm you up with the sheet
Zip you up and roll
Now Doggystyle records is now official
Gettin' money at the Pliz-ate with my initials
Shippin' weapons overseas
I'm makin' G's
What who you make call enemies
But I
See nothing funny about
Makin' money
'Cause uh
We all know it don't grow on trees
So I
Gotta' get what I gotta' get when I can
Up homie in the morning with the gat van
Burning rubber down to get a new car
So don't get jealous when you see me in the
Double R.
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head
Say Snoop's upside yo' head"
226,Snoopafella,1999,No Limit Top Dogg (1999),Hip Hop,Snoop Dogg,"Once upon a time, in the L.B.C.
On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, peep game
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
""We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!""
And even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows
Girls used to say, ""Snoop, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit""
Welllll, one day, up the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew
He said ah, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess""
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said, ""Step-dad, may I?""
And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied (Cinderfella!)
My brothers were goin', they were gettin' down
Even Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!)
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
""We can and you can't,"" is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah)
They all stood there, laughin' in my face
And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!""
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss
And I'd get them back if I had one wish
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, ""What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb
I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish""
I said, ""Herb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest""
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was jumpin' in my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet was some white tube socks
And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock
I showed him my sack, and don't you know
With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!)
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, ""One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self""
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
I jumped in the low-low and went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well all right!)
The princess was starin', while holdin' a drank
Reflected from her eyes was gold tank
She waved her hands like, ""Hello! Hi!""
Then gave another gesture like, ""Come here, guy!""
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
The bitch was swingin' from the hard knocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps
For the six-fo' I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess screamed out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!""
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout
My fresh low-low, also went too
And there was no denyin that my night was through
The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away, still feelin' pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next mornin, when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat
Slid into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin', ""Wasn't that you? Nah, it couldn't be""
They kept askin me if I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock at the door
""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked
""The princess,"" this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin' for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin' her shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
And said, ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief""
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?""
Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?""
I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light
And I was wearin shit, from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'
Yelled to my family, ""I've GOT to go!""
We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me, I heard my family cry...
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)
And I'm the rapper Doggy Dogg you love
(Cinderfella Doggy Dogg!)"

Ridin' 'round town layin' game down like Goldie
And I remember what my momma showed me
Told me game recognize game
And stay true to what ya do and don't be ashamed
I got all my game from her sometimes I have to wonder
How I keep from goin' under I'm a cold muthafucka
I fall to my knees and thank God before I do my thang
I don't know why, I love to gangbang
See life ain't nothin' but a twist anyway bitch anyway
You can say what you wanna say
Just don't get in my way 'cause I'm a mean old
Fiend know C know & P know see loc

When I take the nina Ross ya know I gotta ta have it
I lay back in the cut retain myself
Think about the shit and I'm thinkin' wealth
How can I makes my grip
And how should I make that nigga straight slip
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As l dip around the corner, now l'm on a-nother
Mission, wishin', upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggaz down like Evander Holyfield, chill
To the next Episode
I make money, and I really don't love hoes
Tell ya the truth, I swoop in the Coupe
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops
But now I, make, hits, every single day
With, that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So lay back in the cut, motherfucker 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop
Boy it's gettin' hot, yes indeed it is
Snoop Dogg on the mic l'm about as crazy as Biz
Markie, spark the, chronic bud real quick
And let me get into some fly gangsta shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggaz try to play the D O G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm fin to fuck a bitch, what's her name it's Luke
You tried to see me, on the TV, youse a B G
D O double G, yes I'ma O G
You can't see my homey Dr. Dre
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say
Gotta take a trip to the MIA
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin' AK
You, can't, see, the D-O-double-G, 'cause that be me

The Lexus, flexes, from Long Beach to Texas
Sexist, hoes, they wanna get with his
'Cause Snoop Dogg is the shit, beitch
Ah, I'm somewhat brain boggled
So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, have it, stick it to the plug
It's Snoop, Doggy, I got a got a fat dub
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket loc
Need myself a lighter so I can't take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P O U N D and my nigga Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut, like I told your ass
Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who fuck him, gimme the ass
'Cause they know about the shit that we be goin' through
And they know about the shit that I be puttin' up
And they be knowin' 'bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic
'Cause Snoop Dogg is Trump tight like a virgin, the surgeon
Is Dr. Drizzay, so lizzay, and plizzay
With D O double Gizzay the fly human being seein'
No I'm not European bein' all I can
When I put the motherfuckin' mic in my hand, and
You don't understand when l'm kickin'
'Cause Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me
Listen to me, 'cause I do you like you wanna be done
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three two one, umm
Dum, diddy-dum here I come
With the gat and the guitar was strung, I'm
Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was
When I caught you slippin', I'm gon catch you then I peel your cap
Snapped back, relax

Stay in your own lane stay on your own and quick trying to be grown
Day turn to night and play turn to fight
Yeah I guess my granny was right
Reflections of the way life used to be
It's all right
I like them girls from Ladera Heights or the girls on Hills
I take a trip up the World On Wheels and get in a fight
Make it back to my ride
Pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side
My big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo
Slid me away just to get me away
I'm just a Long Beach nigga outside of my hood
I'm banging riding but doing it good
When I get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering
As soon as I hit the County I'm up in 48 hundred
With the dealers the killers the [?]
The best from the west and the beast from the east
Yeah I'm acting a fool
I'm getting my degree from gladiator school
I chose this life 'cause I knows this life
Sell a little crack and my flows is tight

Or the homie on the corner getting major cream
In the Cadillac beating like Battle Cat
A nigga with money don't know how to act
Smoke till your eyes get cataracts
All money nonsense yeah none of that
Quarter sack run it back
Hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that
If a trick jump the track do you want your money back
Lil bitch was a bunny rat
Watch for the funny hat

But when it comes down to the action part, the most folks take a little
Light vacation""
(Snoop Dogg)
Mmmm... I was just thinkin' to myself man
Y'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me
And I need to let my peoples know how deep it is to me
On some real talk like...
It's like lookin' and poppin' and seein whoppers and movers
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low
Nobody's guidance so I decided to sleep by the do'
Open my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'
Driftin off into another stage of life
Nigga paid your price and big homies made ya fight
Niggas ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no
Toe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'
(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open your eyes and take your time to visualize
And once you decide to move your mind in due time
It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin' naughty
Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move your body
It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest
You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it

Fuck that nigga, I'ma do it right
Thangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like
For me to be mad, saying, ""Niggaz can't stand me""
Sittin' at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's
Wishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl
Basically you hear these rappers out here using my flow
They need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though
In dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI
Takin' my time, chronolizing my rhyme
Writing my rhyme, tryin' to get intellectual
Directing the weather, makin' my negative records more intellectual
Tryin' to change the direction of flowin
And sayin', born sayin', ""You know I get live-er when I get fluent""
Ain't been nobody to change game since King came
Same thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable
And they don't know how to do it 'cause they don't flow that way
Go that way, roll that Jay
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony
You're so into what ya doin' but you can't get into it
You can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'ma do it

On the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt
Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open your eyes and take your time to visualize
And once you decide to move your mind in due time
It's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin' naughty
Freeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move your body
It's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest
You done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it

We bust till we buss 'em up
Lay Low, I know they told you not to fuck with us

Thought I wouldn't get caught 'cause I was way too clever
I learned there's no one to catch ya when ya fallin'
And they'll be no one to hear you when you're callin
Do you know what it's like to wake up in the mornin
While you're starvin you're hearin bugs crawlin
Reminiscin' on them days you was walkin'
With pretty women on your arm while you're flossin'
Thankful that I didn't end up in a coffin

All my playas in Houston
Atlanta GA (Georgia boys, in the hou-)
(We'll say sup to that New Orleans clique out there)
(Snoop Dogg)
It's a Sunday a fun day, one day
Away from Monday, and all day ain't no gunplay
And everything is all right outside (why)
'Cause ? put his speech down and got all the brothers to ride
For one cause, and that's how it is y'all
Wise on up to rise on up dawg
Each one teach one, let the lesson be taught
It ain't my fault your homie Tommy Boy got caught
If he was slicker than grease, he woulda been at peace
Instead tryna ride while the war was at cease
(Daz Dillinger)
When me and Snoop was kids we always knew this kid named Tommy
His parents died left him with gangit kinds of money
But Tommy was a hustler from around the way
Stayed on the northside of town, is where he say
He paid attention to whatever, they was games so clever
If the situation was bad it can only get better
He ran around the dope house
(Snoop Dogg (Daz))
So he put us up on his scheme
He knew that we was riders so he wanted us on his team
(Uh, poor Tommy)
Getcha money, size team (uh)
Getcha money man
(He was out to get paid)
Getcha money man (Poor Tommy)
Getcha money man (Me and Snoop on his team)
(Get paid) Gotta have that money man (Getcha money man)
Getcha money man (Getcha money man)
(Snoop Dogg)
Tommy was a rider, big money
Tommy had everything, it wasn't funny
All the younger G's used to look up to him
But there was no way, that the bigger ones could do him
They would try him, try him, every time he was slick
But he never would slip, he always had his grip
And if he did, he'd get away 'cause he was just to fast
Homie up Tommy, Tommy, Tommy's out to mash
Get it, get it, get it, 'cause ya gotta have it
And when ya get make sure ya grab it and stab it
Maintain it, brain it, the way ya gots to
'Cause this is somethin' to rock to
(Daz)
Man, we sacked up dollars and Caddies,
Omiscious muggin 'em for him
We had to gather up cash - whoever owed it to him
The hitman had hit us, niggas runnin' shit,
And never wantin to quit us, when the machine gun spit
Now we really deep in the game, now it's murder and drugs
No names involved when that nigga caught a slug
Tommy told us forget it, that he's always down wit us
The problems of the murder will be acquitted (young nigga)
(Snoop Dogg)
Now word on the streets is that Machine Gun Tommy,
Ridin' on big ballers for a pastime hobby
So if ya havin' money, and ya smoke big weed
First thing ya need is a security team
And we provide, or should I say we ride for Tommy
My compadre, and if he say ""spray em"", we spray
So I suggest, you get with the 'PG,
Or find yourself layin six feet dizzy
(Daz (Snoop Dogg))
We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man... getcha money man... getcha money man)
On the streets doing his thang, gettin' paid

We was down with big Tommy

We was down with big Tommy
(Getcha money man... getcha money man..)
Check me out now man

We had money, jewelry and expensive cars
Niggas who didn't know us, finally know who we are
We was important to the neighborhood like presidents and mass,
Everytime he do a lick he break us off our proper share
A couple of days Tommy was on top of the world
Threw a party with the homies, invited gangs of girls
(Snoop Dogg)
Yeah, it was off the hook ya'know
We had everything from Indo to blow (Whhaaatt, you sniff blow?)
Oh hell no, I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin
If Tommy find out, boy he'll be trippin'
So I stay A-Ok, but anyway
Tommy got somethin' to say, to say, to say...
(Tommy talking)
Aye look here mayne,
What some people won't do for money
Yeah I had these two niggas that was on my team
Ya'know, down with me like the Grey Tape

And I've asked Josh to be your bodyguard
All right Dason
It might be good for Joshua to seal, like he has somethin' to do
So detached from us, these are only for you

Damn, cool, good, so good, gotta do wrong
So cold should... gotta do wrong

You might get got, and you might not
Make it to see a whole 'nother day, you better
Watch your hand and watch how you play
Cause you don't know how the system might get you twisted
If you don't pay attention, and you'll come up missin'
I'ma give it to you - live and direct
'Cause I know, a million niggas doin' bad and they check
They game every day but they try to find a way
But somehow, some way, there ain't no pay (uh)
It's the same game, from my town to your town
From L.A. to Chi-Town, Baghdad (that's right)
To the rebel we deliver the true game
And niggas gettin' upset 'cause they can't maintain (player haters)
Don't get mad 'cause I was blessed with a gift
To give you people what you need and no more deep shit (that's right)

Can you name a rapper who can fade the dog - hell nah
And if you can - you're lyin' to yourself
And if you lyin', you're dryin' with your cover
And if you dyin', you fuckin' with your death
I'm Snoop Dogg and I'm the top rapper, at the top of the shelf
I leave these suckers in amazement, dazement
And Death Row is still the label that pays me

What should I do? (should I do) Should I watch, uh?
Or should I jump in? Or should I come with the glock?
I knocks on the door, plus ""Oh No""
I gots to avoid the drama and take the slow-mo
Type of approach - I'm the team and the coach
I hooks a left turn - no burn, for your concern, you gots to learn
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I'ma give you what you earned
And if you get it, watch me spit it
I'm committed to do it and I'm a still acquitted
Never ever did it, or forget it
This guaranteed to keep the party hittin'
And I'ma give you people what you need
And I'ma smoke up on just like a bag of weed
And if you into the mixture and into the rapture
Just sit back and listen cause Snoop Dogg's about to catch ya
Snatch ya and adapt ya with the shit that I got (hmm-hmm)
I'm guaranteed to rock the party non-stop (that's right)
You ain't never heard a rapper who can flip this script
Guranteed to make the hoe's go ahead and get whipped
And when they stop rockin' - they won't
But if you fake the funk (youse a punk), then youse a punk (haha)
You gots to keep it real with yourself baby boy (boy)
'Cause if you don't then you ain't labelled ""The Real McCoy""
I'm Snoop Dogg, yes I'm true indeed
I'm guaranteed to light it up and ride it up and side it up

{*Cameras flashing, Snoop interviewing Bill Clinton*}
Yo, hold on hold on hold on hold on
Stop the cameras, stop the press stop the press
Now Bill, this yo' nigga, Snoop Dogg
Now answer me this - did you fuck that bitch or what?
(Bill Clinton)
That's actually, not the first time that question's been asked; but
Since, I believe, and I think any person - reasonable person would
Believe, that that is not covered, in the definition of sexual
Relations I was given - ah - I'm not going to answer it except to
Refer to my statement. I had intimate, contact with her that was
Inappropriate - I do not believe any of the contacts I had with
Her violated the definition I was given; therefore I believe I
Did not, do anything but testify truthfully on these matters.
(Chorus One: KoKane)
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie... hie...
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes?
What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie... hie...
(Chorus Two: Snoop Dogg)
Lies, lies, stories and alibis
Big Mac in the land of the small fries
Everyone lies and tries to get by
Some of us drink while most just get high
(Snoop Dogg)
You tryin' to cover up the holes in your sneakers
You need to put your motherfuckin face to the speakers (ba-bom, ba-bom)
And quit tryin' to run from it (holla holla at me)
And c'mere, you big dummy (dumb ass nigga)
Don't you know you can't run from the Dizzogg
I'm down with (?) za, the long arm of the lizzaw
Y'all, niggaz know what's happening you turn your back again
And I'm bound to get it crack-a-lin I'm back again
And everybody happy for me - ain't that the truth?
That's a motherfuckin lie (fuck that fool)
Black folks stick together till we die, hmm
That'll be the day...
(Chorus One)
(Snoop Dogg)
Liar, liar, pants on fire
Smoke so much dope they call me Snoopy Pryor (well God damn!)
Which way is up I'm tryin' to get higher
I won't stop puffin till I re-tire
My bitches, my niggaz, they off the wire
They love-ly, they love me, call me Sire
Movie star bitches the ones you desire
Angela Bassett, Tyra, Mariah, the flyest, the flyer
See most bitches like fuckin' with a rider
Slider, to the sider, invite her
To a gangsta, party, provider {*laughing*}
With a lot of meat by-products (mm)
And beat the puddy-pot and got up
She licked the dick from the top to the bottom
{*Woo woo woo woo*} (That's a bad bitch!)
Then she grabbed me by my nuts, and said ""Hmm I got 'em!""

Turn it up, nigga, this shit's in stereo
I walked in with a philly ho
Let me give it to you, young locc, on the really though
Hands, the keys, the Benz, the trees
The birds, the bees, the C's, the G's
I get it like I'm 'posed to, you should be close to me
Right up under my wing
Words I sing, verbs I bring
Bread to the park, head in the dark
Ready with art, I said it with heart
Merely distorted, dearly departed
Look what you started
I'm cool as a mother and you acting retarded
Just what the motherfuckin' doctor ordered
It's the d-o-g with the p-o-p
Not one, not two, but three
I gotta have two or more
Two or more, baby
Maybe even three or four
Like three, like four
Listen to me, baby
I need two or more
Yeah
Maybe even three or four
She likes love, drugs, and sex
Love, drugs, and sex
She likes love, drugs, and sex
Have a seat and don't say one word
Cause you will never catch Snoop Dogg with just one bird
And if I do, I'll probably kick it to the curb
And come anew
Runnin' back, I'm-a keep runnin' through
Hut one, hut two
Down set, hike two, three, four
We go overtime
I'm-a give you something that's gonna blow your mind
And take your time, relax a bit
I came here to mack a bitch
This P is so immaculate
I rap a bit just to taste
Puttin' hair to the snare to the bass
Snap that, Snapchat, flick it up
One of me, three of y'all, so lick it up
I'm back to the hangin' again, bangin' again
Nigga, could you sing it again?
I gotta have two or more
Two or more, baby

Love, drugs, and sex
She likes love, drugs, and sex
Freak-a-leek, I speak the truth
I got girls lined up trying to get in the booth
Original, more like a miracle
High definition visual, digital, minimal
But it can be maxed out
Track meet, more meat blow your back out
I had to pull the 'lac out
Cause there was too many of y'all to be left out
I stepped out mackish with the whole package
Bread with the cabbage, me and a bad bitch
Or two, make it three
31 flavors, nigga
It gets no better than this
Now, who in the world can get you more wetter than this?
I'm back to the hangin' again, bangin' again

265,Up Jump tha Boogie,1996,Tha Doggfather (1996),Hip Hop,Snoop Dogg,"Intro/Chorus:
Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie
While you're bangin' on ya baby OG's
That's why I flip the script to the boogie bang homey
If I'm hangin' it's with DPG
*Repeat*
Verse 1: Snoop Doggy Dogg
Some do the things that they do 'cause they dumb
And some do the things that they do for crumbs
I do mine for me ya see?
Not the big homey double O-G
Scared to do your own work, man that's fast
And that's the reason why I had to shoot you down
Because you never should've tried to work my Dogg
And the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump
Y'all know the game ain't the same no mo'
Lil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!
Johnny Rockafella went to jail-er
Few many times too many and became a teller
They sell a nigga dreams if he want em
But they won't sell you the game to get up on em
Ya tryin' ta find 'em 'cause you want em, they shook out
Get the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out
It ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga
But it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us
But it's steel, you put it in their head
That at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)
Verse 2: Kurupt
Aiyo Snoop, why would niggas get into the bracket
And make a loot, niggas want trip
Spittin' like ""you spoke beef from the hood
Show me love nigga or don't show me shit""
Feel the fever, million dollar male like Cole Severs
Made a non-believin man into a believer
Receive a cheque the next day, my homies say
""It's the way to get paid"", DP's and pay
I don't know why you wanna get on my back? (why?)
Trippin' 'cause you know the bomb's at where I'm at
Well if that's the case you shoulda roll
Wit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)
This is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue
Me, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop
Niggas from Seth be tryin' to set you 'cause you settin your ways
So ask DJ Pooh what pays
Verse 3: Snoop Dogg
Just what we need, bangin' on wax another trip
What you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?
You're like a actor wit another script
Predictable as Rambo wit another clip
How many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?
You need to sit down and learn to get down first
'Cause, uh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers
Not part-time FBI singers
Niggas havin' bad intentions, sendin BG's on a mission
One move too many, nigga you missin'
Listen you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no
Loony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D
Niggas got too flossy from all the sex they tossin
But guess what it cost em, they crossin me
But before I give a nigga a 9
I'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme"

There is no one for you but me, and I mean that
And I think about all the things we've been through
Like arguing and fighting for example
You know the love we have for each other
It tends to out weigh what do to another
Ya know my granddaddy use to always say
Ya know he used to say it like this

What up motherfuckers? this is snoop dogg
I'm trying to figure out how the fuck I'm gonna do y'all
Hanging with my homie from the turf, that's young q-ball
Giving me the word from the street, heres the scoop y'all
The niggaz from the eastsidaz split up (split up)
And one of 'em tried to fuck yo' shit up (what?)
Naw 'cause, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life
I'm out with the bullshit, I'm in wuth the real shit

L-B-C-2-1-3 hell yeah, we in this
It's so relentless, and all my dogs up against the life sentence

There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
I used to have a lot broads that I doont fool with
I used to have a lot of homeboys I ain't cool with
A lotpeople that a nigga used to go to school with
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it
But what none of them would believe though (what?)
That I would be bigger the kurtis blow
I guess he was right, these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches, I'm gettin' cake
To realize your fate through faith, (through faith)
'Cause we all gonna get that day (for what)
To see if our lives was straight
And to see if we gonna walk through thosse pearly gates (yeah?)
To see the man upstairs, on some real talk homie
I'm tires of being stuck here
If I could I would fly to the moon (zoom)
Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off deeze mushrooms (I know)[chorus]
There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
There will be, ups and downs,
Smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
Now as I think back to the words my granddaddy used to say
I never seen him in church, but he always had the word
He would always tell me! sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad
You gotta do bad in order to do good"

Who sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'
'Ain't No Fun', now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg would get it
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female wit fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talkin' about baby please she wrought his service stress
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stop flautin and won't it speakin'
Be comin' round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be beggin please
Dyin' for the day to eat these
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heeb wit tha beep for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow best laid back
But back in the day he wasn't nothin' like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hangin' down wit his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood tha people treated him bad
Said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta
Or be there in jail or some other shaker
But now he's grown up to be a surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slangin world wide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known ta y'all as D.J. Warren G
He cut grass trasform wit finesse
... And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rap
He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said
Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on till the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the link
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is havin' papers so my homies write straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store
Offerin him a job but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people love Warren
'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they call sessy bussin
The vapors
They caught vapors
I got to talk 'bout me now
Last subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
And since they wasn't tryin' to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street
And said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said
No, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After gettin' rejected, I ain't runnin' upset
I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?' Rhymes at rates
When I used to go to parties, they make me wait
What I have to get on the mic to set M-C straight
I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listenin to my music
They acted like I wanted to keep hangin' with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?

Known ta y'all as D.J. Warren G
He cut grass trasform wit finesse
... And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rap
He tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss front and said
Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on till the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the link
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dip
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is havin' papers so my homies write straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Warren welcome to my store
Offerin him a job but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people love Warren
'Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they call sessy bussin
The vapors
They caught vapors
I got to talk 'bout me now
Last subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
And since they wasn't tryin' to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street
And said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said
No, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After gettin' rejected, I ain't runnin' upset
I said, 'What's a Dogg do to?' Rhymes at rates
When I used to go to parties, they make me wait
What I have to get on the mic to set M-C straight
I ain't never love no hoe since I'm listenin to my music
They acted like I wanted to keep hangin' with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
Short Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?
'We used to see Daz, back in the day'
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed
You caught the vapors
You caught the vapors
You got the papers"
270,Vato,2006,Tha Blue Carpet Treatment (2006),Hip Hop,Snoop Dogg,"I was chilling, right around my way

And smack your neck back, you drop off falling
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl
You would think that they wore bra's
Believe in all the things that you never saw
In it y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a menathol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow, all my dough?
What the fuck, no
See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed
All you hear my enemies going
Vato you won't believe what they saw

If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth
God Damn
If Snoop a keep a foot on the streets
And lead and cover the sheets
Run wit them niggaz wit the heat
You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace in fact
I could be beast of the East motherfucker
I never hesitate to blaze
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team 'cause my people's
Are screaming that we need more for fun or is it legal (With a bang)
On this song make it feel like a drive-by
It's ashame but somebody gotta die
They say it happens state to state
But when I'm mobbin' LA
All I hear the Ese's say they go
Vato you won't believe what they saw
I saw these pack a guys and they act real hard... (And what they do?)

And if we got into some shit we never pop shots
We'd squab scrap whatever it was
And live to talk about it and we get old cause
And keep a pack of zig zags for that good old bud
We do a house party what the fuck is a club
And the ese's they sold most of the drugs

Black Lac like that and it's sitting on chrome
Plaque in back strap in Lac
Antennas wake you up for a rat trying to set a new trap
Swinging the track dripping curl juice on your back
Breaking hearts like Roger and Zapp motherfucker

Hang out with your friends and smoking the reefer

We had a reckless motherfucker
That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg

We never had a nigga like Big P
From the Southside, nigga goin' ""woof""

That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was

I gotta be careful when I show you stuff

And you prefer the peace
And won't get mad if you don't have no one to fight with
We pull the cards around a phony
My sister told me, ""Niggas act hard around they homies""
Because the West don't need no beef
We need our (?) and our roaches
And our Reres and our Monique

What if you talked to that man
And understood before you shot him?

Let me holler at you, boo, damn I miss you
I just wanna kiss you and all that good stuff
Was I really all that bad or was I good enough?
I'm under pressure, I can't run plays like this
My mama always said that there'll be days like this
I'm all alone by the phone, in a zone, face is stone
Wonderin', if you ever comin' home
I try to run the streets and play
But that feeling just won't go away
My whole life I'd throw away, to get you back on my team
Damn, why'd you have to go away?
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
I'm missin' my, baby, think I'm goin' crazy
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
You can't leave me by myself like this
(Why did you leave me?)
You can't leave me by myself like this
Mama told me there'll be days like this
I get up early in the mornin', miss your rudeness and kissin'
I also miss that smell of that good breakfast in the kitchen
Listen, I'm a star but I'm wishin'
To follow you wherever you are
You the wheels to my car and I can't roll with you
My heart is a ice box, it's cold without you
Why'd you have to leave me this way?
I'm doin' bad, you don't wanna see me this way
I'm at the pad, tryin' to do my best
I'm so stressed and yes, I'm still the king of the West
Tryin' to manage and I'm gon' handle it
I need you back in my life 'cause I'm tired of livin' scandalous
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me

You can't leave me by myself like this

Mama told me there'll be days like this
Oh my Lord, I'm sittin' at the board with my head down
I can't write my next line, I need to lay it down
Hmm, I'm stuck like a dump truck
Lookin' stupid, cupid down on my luck
I touch a four leaf clover
Hopin' for somethin' good, like I should, if not I guess it's over
Baby, be real with it, do you love me, do you miss me?
Sure I can't deal with it
I miss your breakfast in the mornin'
Miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
Please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me

Heavily influenced I do it like you can't
I'm the weed to the Zag with the bag and a drink
Get live that's five on the black hand side
Now try to stay fly with a piece of pie
I heard fish don't burn in the kitchen
The baby gangstas they get in the hood and on a mission
You pump 'em up they fuck it up
Now what you need to do is toughen up
Now thug it up what it do dog
I thought you wanted to be like big

When I feel lost
With nowhere to go
She'll be my inspiration

Time with her friends
Tells me she's mute without me
And when things go wrong
Her faith is strong
I know that she'll never doubt me

Gangsta niggaz do your dance

Gangsta bitches wave yo' hands

See me, I'm bout my money my paper I'm bout my dollars
Poppin' collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers
See we smoke and go hoein cause the bitch ain't never shit to me
And pussy stay sellin, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thuggin' off on the stereo
Killin' 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em 'cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothin', we keep gettin' more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top
Hit hit the switch and smash down the block
And oh yeah this Long Beach so you know when you see a nigga
And don't never get the wrong idea nigga
(Yeah, nigga what?) Holla at 'em
(Snoop Dogg)
I keep my khakis creased, hat tilted to the East
On a bitch I remain the beast, none the least
Police try to cuff me and stuff me in the back
Of they patrol car, 'cause I'm a former parole star
With the cool name, this nigga here's a fool mayn
Go on and do yo' thang, gang-bang
In the hood and in Hollywood
Record company executives think it's all to the good
Get to showin me around they house, then he slide me in the back
And had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out mayn
I'm down with P, and D-R-E
A real nigga from the motherfuckin L.B.C.
I just look like this, I stay down for the twist
I'm real with this, deep as abyss

Befo' you motherfuckers was even ready for it?
Showed you how to tie a flag on your head
And represent your motherfuckin set till you're dead
Bust on the cops while I cuss the Feds
Roll a joint, in the bathtub gettin' head
Put the G in the P, flipped the G to a ki
Put the West coast back on the map bay-bee
Check my styles, check my files
I've been gangbangin since I was a juvenile
They cut me loose in nine-deuce I swore to tell the whole truth
Keep it gangbang 100 proof
E'rybody say, ""Ay Snoop"" - did Death Row pay me?
Look here young loc, shit it's all to the gravy
I really can't trip off the past, on the real I had a blast
Tupac, rest in peace and God bless all my enemies

Ain't No Limit to this shit, ain't no gimmick
Master P good lookin' out homeboy, salute my Lieutenant (at ease)
I'm in it knee deep and can't creep no more
I had to move down South on the low-low, fo' sho' doe
Dippin through the woods with Fiend, Magic, Pokey
Mystikal, V-90, C, Boz and P (ya heard me?)
Windows on tint, ridin' like the President
It's evident, shit I'm doin' good (yeah)
I moved out the hood like I should (say what?)
And then they had the nerve to call me Hollywood (nigga what?)
But I don't give a fuck, if I'm misunderstood
20 Crip don't slip, yeah it's all to the good
Yeah the homies got twist too, whatchu say?
Oh the homies might get me? They'll get you
Listen here, don't try it, and don't deny it
And don't pay 'em no mind Dogg, man I'm tryin'
(Chorus w/ variations)

Just when you thought I was gone, I'm back on
Knick-knack-paddy-wack give the Dogg a home
With a gang of pitbulls, rottweilers and doberman pinschers
Bonafied killers
The illest, cap peelers, that you ever wanna meet
Straight up out the ghetto where they pack the heavy metal
I got my hand on the wheel, my foot on the gas pedal
I'm drivin' DoggHouse to the next level (woof)
And buckin two shots at the devil
Run up on his ass, and blast, like a rebel
Turn up the treble 'cause I hit you with the bass
Remember my name and remember my face
Remember these words, and remember the taste
And remember, we all gotta leave this place
I'm tryin' to stay focused, I'm the loc'est in the game
The Rap Prime Minister, ""Mr. G Thang""
(Chorus Two: KoKane)
Rain-drops, fallin' on my head
Fuckin' with the wrong folks, messin with my spread
Talkin' 'bout the raindrops, fallin' on my head
Messin with my ba-by, who's sleepin' in my bed

Tell me if you want, just what I want
'Cause I got, what you need
Baby if you need some, get it from me
'Cause I got, what you want
I want you to want, just what I want
Just want, what I want
Ooh you got just what I want
(Goldie Loc)
Look mama make you hot like a corn to pop
And watch how fast you see a nigga boxers drop
I'm trying to work it fast, but I know you like it slow
You know I got to bust a nut and hurry up and go
You got something that I want right now
Hurry up and let me put the black spot on the cow
Make the pussy ball up like salt to a snail
And when I kill it big daddy, I want you to tell
'Cause I don't give a damn when it come to freaking hoes
Call up forty hoes, and have a rolly peep show
And when you give me something, you gone want something back
This dick to your mouth, little mama like that
Fish cost too much, so I feed her sardines
Man I'm the motherfucking MVP of the team
Cold game how a nigga steady spitting this shit
Make her mama jump back and say bitch is a pimp
(Charlie Wilson)
Of course she love my nine
Bitch I got that antidote
Got a bigger dick that'll crack your spine
Then I'm gonna let it inside your throat
(Ludacris)
Tricked out, kicked out get her on gone
Ludacris on the motherfucking microphone
Heey, what's up I came to pimp
Fur hats and fur clothes, and a razor tim
Biiiiatch, I got it made
Just pick one of my hoes, and I got it leid
You never heard as many bitches so fast and frequent
Can I get the ends, bitch delinquents
Run my bath water, cook my meals
And SHUT THE FUCK UP, when I book the deals
And iron my draws, give me cuffs and creases
It's your nephew come to fuck your nieces
Gimme what I want
I got what you need
Gimme what I want
Yeah, yeah"
290,You Thought,1996,Tha Doggfather (1996),Hip Hop,Snoop Dogg,"--Soopafly--
I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever
Man, Soopafly never ever ever
Fell for the do no and you know I'm
Too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoez
It's too much for me to be givin' to you
Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you
Now Sh????, I told the bitch to blaze the weed
Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew
Hey, I got knocked off on the bar
And my room got knocked off in the car
Gave it to me until I reached my peak
Baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week
I said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast
You've been givin' up too much damn cock and givin' up too much ass
Nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that
Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back
Ever since she tripped, I went on one
Stepped in the club, Caught me a homerun
Baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth
Talkin' bout what could pop out and hit the roof
Then she said somethin' 'bout the cost
Man, that same bus stop is where
I dropped that bitch back the fuck off
You can't ride my bird
So I kicked that bitch to the curb
You best to believe
You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me
You thought you had my grip
But Soopafly never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Till I turned around and whupped yo' ass
...Like a pimp and that's for real
--Snoop Dogg--
I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe lookin' too cute
Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on
Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas
She fly but she wasn't the sexiest
She had a hoe with her named Bama, short for Alabama
A big bad mama-jamma, now look here
I like big bitches 'cause they large
And big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got alot of cash for a little love
All they wanna do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss Snoop Dogg
I don't see a god damn thang
That's stoppin' you from buying me that god damn ring
It'd look nice on my finger, I'm a buy you a zinger
Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer
Your homegirl, bring her 'cause I've been dying to meet her
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her
But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her...
It was fun while it lasted
You know what they say, big things come in small packages, baby
You thought you had my grip
But Snoop Dogg never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whupped your ass
...Trick beyotch beyotch
--Too $hort--
I said beyyyotch, what are you smokin'
A big fat dick comin' from east Oakland
There must be some kind of misunderstanding
Hit the parking lot, bitch I be standing by the Benz
You think a nigga rich, bitch
Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick
For all the wrong reasons
Niggas ain't trippin' during pimp season
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday
I rolled to my house with the bitch
(What'd you do $hort) introduced her mouth to my dick
Glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable
You fuckin' with a dog, bitch you ain't fin' to come up, hoe
So you might as well enjoy the ride
And serve this nigga from the eastside
How much for the game that I'm sellin'
Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen
I know sex sells but I'm a tell you though
Couldn't spend on shit that ain't valuable
Fucked all night woke up the next mornin'
Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on
Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent
It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money
You thought you had my grip
But Too $hort never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whupped your ass
...Trick beyotch beyotch
...I got family members, homeboys...
Muthafuckaz I look out way before you."
