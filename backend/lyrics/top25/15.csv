0,A Trip Out of Town,2000,Anarchy (2000),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"(Busta Rhymes)
Yo, it all began like, bust it
My nigga City bout to bounce on a trip
We met some niggas with alot of things they want 'em to flip
I told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip
Travel safe, you know that I'ma hold it down on the strip
Good lookin', word to mother son I give you my wit
But when I get back, I'ma bounce straight to your crib
On the strength, son slid until you to the Greyhound
Wit a burner in the knapsack, headed straight outta town
Now, three days pass I'm still on the strip
Doin' hand to hand with twelve collapsible, stashable clips
With little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like a project
When police come we stick the clips in any metal object
Throwin' a nigga on the walls and try to search me down
I laugh knowin' that my stash'll never be found
Well anyway, on the third day, son came straight to the strip
Wit a new floss and shiny shoes on the whip
My nigga hit me with the latest, greatest
He told me get inside the whip so I can know just what the up to date is
He said he fuckin' wit some Guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is
What kind of dough they get, and how they handle they biz
How they connect with Jamaician niggas who speak American
And how they chains swung a medallion iced out pelicans
And how they stay wit four pounders
And speak American to try to blend in
Like they ain't obvious out of towners
Okay, I've never heard of workers gettin' five G's pay
For trips that last for only 2-3 day
How these Guyanese niggas be eatin pasta but they love zucchini
Rockin' valor tennis suits by Sergio Tecchini
Them type of cats that call you because you can't call 'em
Rockin' baseball fitters with wild animal skins on 'em
How they rock silks and tailor made pants
And get a matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance
Washrags hangin' from every one of our back pockets
>From every fine wine to champagne them niggas'll straight cop it
And set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential
Rock laced whips while the workers'll floss the latest rentals
How they fuck with arrogant bitches who act pussy
And love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy
After all of that I wanted ones
The way my nigga was talkin' so next trip I went to bounce with son
So now we out of town with Guyanese cats
Up in they gates bubbling packages and layin wit gats
Shit was slow until the main fiend was offed
Just like a thief in the night
And spread the word that we was back with the white
(Intermission)
""Ayo why don't you tell that crackhead to close the fuckin' door
And shut the fuck up""
""Yeah man and clean the motherfucking spot up, smell like...""
""Break the fuckin' breakdown in the working city... yo go get the plates
And the gym star""
""Yo light that up, lemme hit that, gimme a light, yeah man cut that""
""Fuck this shit""
(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah, see how we blowin' pa
The lookout niggas holdin' fort like they was watchtowers
Buggin on how we went through, a half a brick every couple of hours
So on and so on, shit is good and we eatin
First nigga to short a package will catch the most brutal beatin'
The whole town, see we now own it
Carryin on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments
We stackin cheddar now and shit is all clear
And we was growin' as workin niggas wit aspiring ideas
We love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit
But in the grand scheme these niggas'll love to have they own shit
Now these niggas was really ready to swell up
We decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop
Off in to the wilderness of the wicked Husid
We set up shops and watched the games begin
So now we ballin like a motherfucker, money was sick
Gas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin' the dick
Fuckin' everything from the local McDonald's bitches with the biggest ass
To attorney bitches that'll beat a charge fast
We used to takin' niggas' custies and leave they set up on tilt
And watch 'em angrily scheme on the shit that we built
Ain't it funny how shit transpire in fact
Not too long after our ride we took the winner's stash, house was at
Some niggas tried to run a jook with things in they palm
Not a problem so immediately reach for the john
Right away the gun BUST! straight lifted a nigga
How we moved his organs with kickback, shifted a nigga
Wild shots fire, everybody scatter like rats
Leavin' nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats
Now we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands
But fuck it, determined to fulfill the best of these plans
Shit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall
My son said he shot, but he wasn't bleeding at all
Word, I started buggin when my nigga said he feel cold
Then I looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole
So as we continue to radically blaze the fifth
Flame the iron, not giving a fuck, y'all niggas wanna rip?
Well we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook
One nigga slid and think he got off the hook
Now let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied
Was one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party
He was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes
Stupid motherfucker tried to front, we had to leak his brain
Suddenly my nigga fell to the floor
And said his legs feel like them shits ain't got no feelins no more
More the actin' up the more the shit I felt in my gut
The shit was all over as soon as the director said CUT!
That's a wrap, good actin' motherfuckers, good actin'
That's the shit I'm talkin' about
Y'all ready to watch the playback?
Fuck around, that shit'll be a box office smash motherfuckers"
1,Abandon Ship,1996,The Coming (1996),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"UHHHH! You don't know what we doin' right here!
Intro/Chorus One: repeat 2X
One two three we gon' turn it out
And make you rock to the beat and then scream and shout
We gonna hit you with the shit we got here
We gonna blow your miiiinnnd (blow your miiiinnnd)
Keep it movin like this keep it movin like that
If I die I'ma only come back
Yo I'm saying if you think that you can step to me wrong
Don't even waste your tiiiimmme (waste your tiiiimmme)
Chorus Two:
You niggaz talk shit then abandon ship
Niggaz talk shit then they abandon ship
Niggaz talk shit, then they abandon ship
Niggaz talk shit then they abandon ship
Verse One: Rampage the Last Boy Scout, Busta Rhymes
I 8Off like the Assassin, now I'm blastin I'm takin' over
Stick you for your blue Range Rover
I told ya, Rampage a real live soldier
Been in the game, sinc the age of thirteen
A microphone fiend, so I'm goin' to see my P.O.
It's August the 1st, so I guess I'm a Leo
My P.O., look like Vanessa Del Rio
She pulled my rap sheet, just like, Neo Geo
Hahahaaa! I always roam through the forest
Just like a brontosaurus, born in the month of May
So my sign is Taurus, kick you in your face
Like my fuckin' name was Chuck Norris, make you sing my chorus
Rock to the beat and then, turn into a walrus
You remain nameless, my victory remains flawless
Acting like you wild, but I know you really harmless
While your time is coming, I make the fat shit regardless
Many niggaz wanna know when the Ramp return
Yo I'm gettin' phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern
He wants to know about my Flip Mode click
The way we get down and BUST NIGGAZ SHIT
LP after LP, we make G's
I run up in your ganks den take you for your keys
I'm not lying or joking, you get broken
Dead in Flatbush, back to Roanoake and...
People always askin me, how your shit be sellin
For makin' shit guaranteed to bust your fuckin' melon
Police throwed me up on charges like I was a felon
There was no tellin', when I was strikin had you swellin
Cruisin in my Lands, watch the police how they be gellin
Lock you up for days and got a nigga ass smellin
Yo FUCK THAT! You best believe there ain't no time for dwellin
If you ain't makin' noise you need to kill the fuckin' yellin'
Chorus One
Chorus Two
Verse Two: Rampage, Busta
Yo, yo, yo I run up in your set like a New York city...
I can't slip, I beat you down with my vice grip
Your lost, that means you way off course
No remorse, I'm gettin' five in The Source
I be saddleback biting motherfuckers like a horse
Turn and toss, niggaz all up in my applesauce
Watch me reinforce, my shit feel good like intercourse
Ever since I was a shorty rockin' Hugo Boss
Aiyyo bust it Bust (why) you just made my day
If you didn't put me on I'd be locked like O.J.
Now I'm writin rhymes hittin shorties everyday
In the full runnin' drinkin' ice Tanqueray
I don't eat pork I take a fish fellet
Now I'm knockin' out niggaz from ... to ... touche!
Now I'm goin' back around the way
I'm rippin shit, like my name was Marvin Gaye
Yo, now I'm back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers
Got you niggaz open like a bunch of wide receivers
Time is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners
Chickenhead, give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins
Squeeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin
When you talk shit you really don't know what you startin
Now your shit is done like a fuckin' empty milk carton
It's on for the nine-six, mad shows at the Ritz
Now we got you open like Fixx
Stickin to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits
Fisherman hat with my brand new kicks
On the low, I still rock my Girbauds
See the show, I got my nickel plated fo'-fo'
All my rough niggaz open the do'
Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'
Yo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper
Fuck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker
Everytime I hit I always hit a little harder
Blazing to the point where niggaz look a little darker
Catching suntans from my music, fans understand
Making fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand
Organized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan
While your ride is busted, I be your luxury Sedan
Number one nigga in the chain of command
Breakin fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan
Aiyyyyyo, I see intruders on my scan
Singin' at your funeral like Bobby Bluebland
Chorus One"

Destroy every arch rival or any challenger

None of y'all niggas really wanna war
The type of nigga to crack my plane in your building
In the name of the law"

Can you see, see, see, see
What's in store for you, for you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Yo, right before I lay your soul to sleep
Witness the day of your wreckin and wit god on the street
Behold! What the fuck y'all niggas come around here for
We massacre the masses so therefore
Here's your, invitation to explore
The way we gather up niggas to thoroughly rep for
My street niggas, C'mon!
Stressed niggas, C'mon!
Hungry niggas, C'mon!
Yes, yes y'all, C'mon!
Hope my live motherfuckers pass the test y'all
Prepare for high retribution, and I hope God bless y'all (bless y'all)
Fuck shit up and watch the truth manifest y'all (fest y'all)
Feel it in your guts and the burnin in your chest y'all (chest y'all)
Pushin through just like a wild flood
With such a pain that's so intense it make y'all wanna cry blood
My slang talk earned a scholarship, from how to style a chick
Influnce rulership and earn another dollar quick (quick)
You need to do the philosophical research
Fuck around and be the next to die you better leave first
Yo, my whole crew extra large, stay charged
Like polytheism havin' belief in many gods
I gotta handful of niggas wit a sick disease
Die close to destructive anti-social tendencies
Yo, turn up the treble just a level
Analyze the science deeper than when Musa symbolized the devil
Now let me ask y'all
(You are now in the current state of Anarchy)
Ha, all hell break loose
Yo, we fight to the end and never call for a truce
Y'all niggas better pick and choose and select the battles wisely
Always with the same approach and never once surprised me
Ha, however how clever
Niggas is fighting for mad cheddar
Yo, cold like the wind blow in the winter
Make you remember the torture like the frostbite that bit off your finger
This Means War, I said it before
Adrenaline rush, heart beat rapid, sweat wet up the floor
Try to threat and wanna battle me nigga
I'ma show you the major differnce between a dream and reality nigga
Yo, then I continuously hype up a nation
Huddle wit my niggas plan for tomorrow go into isolation
And analyze how many niggas gon lose
Tryin' to squeeze they foot up in a pair of great man shoes
And analyze how we was needed to live
Carry out my dooney give the most thanks and be appreciative
Pass this to all my seeds after me
Represent and fight to be that everything my seeds want me to be
The economy has been at it's best, to all my niggas hungry
Let's keep weavin and magical methods of makin' money
So I'ma rep at my fullest, you can't spark me
And fight the hardest in the grim current state of Anarchy..."

Now there ain't no way that you can kill a beast dead
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread
I got oil well money, in the desert playing golf
Go chase short stack sheiki with a Louis scarf
Chest cold diamonds make a nigga wanna cough
In Dubai 20 million on a villa loft
And then I step up in the club then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic
La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo

Pretty women walk around while security on camel-back
Club on fire now, niggas don't know how to act
Sitting in casinos while I'm gambling with Arafat
Money long, watch me purchase pieces of the Almanac
Y'all already know I got the streets bust

So much cake even the money look weird too
Domestic bread and a broad
I'm tryna eat like Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Al-Saud
Who might respect the value of my worth
In Maui, Malaysia, Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia!
La ilaha illa Allah, ha la ili, hay yo

(Hook: Kokane)
Likes to go, eventual
Lead you home, come inside
Why you got your ass on your shoulders
Now, tryin' to spit at a bitch
I lead inside
Why you got your ass on your shoulders
(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah bitch put on an outfit, dazzle ya hair
Come in the club fit to take you home and frazzle the hair
Bitch understand I must have got a handle in here
Why you open up ya ass and let me travel in there
Create a scandal in there
Don't talk, let me pull it out to add another angle in there
Let me ride the back of yo ass like a camel in there
Pussy hot like she lit a fuckin' candle in there
Remember I was tryin' to get my drink in the slot
And you was same girl actin' all stinkin' the spot
It was funny how I thought I wasted breath on the broad
A friend couldn't find her cause shorty left with the God
And then I took her back to the crib, you can figure it out
I'm diggin' it out with the dick in her mouth
Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out
And swingin' about until I start kickin' em' out
Because ya...
(Hook: Kokane)
(Busta Rhymes)
I'm sayin' she fuck a nigga like she want the God to lay in a hearse
Makin' me curse, hope you relate to my verse
And what be makin' it worse
That they be the same bitches frontin' like they wasn't with it at first
Actin' too good for niggas with your ass on your shoulders
But now you'll be fuckin' a nigga till he fall in a coma
I remember how you acted in the front of ya friends
As I remember now you give me head in front of my Benz
So now I'm smackin' it up, while you backin' it up
With a car load of bitches now I'm packin' it up
Now ya whole crew comin' and we whackin' em' up
Let me beat the pussy till I start blackin' it up
Got bitches diggin' in my back scratchin' it up
Got em' screamin' shatterin' glass crackin' it up
Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out
Ass swingin' about till I start kickin' em' out
Because ya...
(Hook: Kokane)
(Busta Rhymes)
Sayin' in ya crib gettin' ya shit right sprayin' yourself
With perfume that mean the dude start playin' yourself
Ya too fly to let ya friends know ya lovin' a nigga
So instead ya front like you ain't really fuckin' a nigga
But still I really love to sit on my dough
And there's nothin' I love when ya keep ya shit on the low
Get cha' homegirl to come start lickin' ya out
Ass swingin' about till I start kickin' em' out
Because ya..."
8,Bad Dreams,2001,Genesis (2001),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"(Busta Rhymes)
Yo me and my niggas and my clique be getting mad cream
Balling the club, now I'm drunk having a bad dream
This mothafucker tried to greet me with wealth
I never knew that I would see that day that I would meet the devil himself
This nigga was eagerly waiting to prove it
Astonishingly, already dancing to his own burial music
Well anyway, he plottin' to do it to me
In a certain kind of way, and started off directly popping shit to me
While he spoke a couple of fires would spark
While he sat in the shadow talking his shit we watch the sky getting dark (he said)
(Devil)
(?) Where it hurts
I'll leave you in a (?) straight up leaking in the back of a church
Let a ghosting crib and haunt you like a ghost in your home
Leaving you old and crippet like them ruins in Rome
Watch your body shrivel up and turn your asses to smoke
Fuck your flesh don't get yo blood sucked, the blood of ya foes
I be that nigga that'll torture your spouse
And leave a thousand body bags like truth.com in front of your house
(Busta)
Got me bugging on a whole notha level
Tell me how the fuck a nigga really end up having beef with the devil
Shit bomb the whole effect the nigga had on my dreaming
Body reacting mentally, going to war with the demon
Semi-chaotic like the typical storm
So embellished in the dream a nigga felt it in the physical form
The dream got my nose runny and shit
Eyes watery, shorty watching my body twitch funny and shit
Giving shorty sleeping with me the creeps
She bugging off how a nigga just sweating and breathing so hard in his sleep
Determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin
Absolutely focused on killing the demon within
So now we fight in the name of my brethren
And every blow connect during the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven,
Ain't hell a deep breath of fresh air
The devil's presence blows a cold draft leaving a scent of death in the air
While my mind was reassembling now
Simultaneous wifey watching a nigga body trembling now
Couldn't conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead
Stabbing a nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head
Yo its funny how the devils'll test us
But if fully select, niggas bless with something some'll raggle with impressions
Till I'm dead I'm always battling through
You can't believe you cut my main vein that all my blood be traveling through
Somebody gotta die, settle the score
Because it's me or this nigga, I'm fighting to the death, I'm ready for WAR
(Devil laughing fades)"
9,Been Through the Storm,2006,The Big Bang (2006),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"(Feat. Stevie Wonder)
(Chorus: Stevie Wonder)
Been Through the Storm, through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillac's with sunroof's mayne
So many ways to make a dollar
Huh, sometimes I think about my father
You see my papa was broke and my mama was young
Tryin' to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin' down my do'
Wonderin' where my next blessin' is comin' from.
My mama and papa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po' stayed away from crime and malice
Hard livin' gave him hard hands and callous
As a young'n, peep how much they loved each other's space
His hard hands rubbin' against the pretty skin of my mother's face
Dig for treasure till his hands looked like hands of a junkie
So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
On the other hand, mommy was the type to work 2 jobs
Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed
Got older, developed ways of grippin' the steel
Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin'
Blendin' in with city folk, down in Flatbush Brooklyn
Feel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it
Homey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin' I been through it
In other words I...
(Chorus: Stevie Wonder)
Been Through the Storm, through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillac's with sunroof's mayne
So many ways to make a dollar
Huh, sometimes I think about my father
You see my papa was broke and my mama was young
Tryin' to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin' down my do'
Wonderin' where my next blessin' is comin' from.
Got a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights, plottin' to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious to visit other cities, out of town kick was serious
Guayanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin' different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on
Wreck is all for the good, gettin' into shit
Like we innocent, actin' older than we should
Walk around broke in the hood, watchin' all the rich niggas
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas
Thinkin' 'about my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin'
To hell with just gettin' by and economizin'
It's kinda hard bein' humble in the belly of struggle
Doin' things that probably get you in trouble
That's why we stay up on the block, gettin' money while we keepin' it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin' the faith
Mom and pop be worryin' for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin' look and see just what I become
A scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin'
Across the line until somebody tryin' to cap me - oh shit. [gunshot]
(Outro: Stevie Wonder - singer slower with more ad libs)
I Been Through the Storm
Through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
Whoa
Yeah-oh."

Unstoppable, yo, Maino!
Ran up in Atlantic, told 'em let me go
Smack my A&R and grabbed him by his throat
Playin' with my life'll get you yellow-taped
Runnin' in and out of church like I'm the yellow Ma$e
All-black fleet like when Obama get in
Missiles aimed at yo' building like Osama livin'
""Fuck 'em all"" is what I'm screamin' from that Mase' seat
(How About Some Hardcore) like it's '93
Think deep, feel the pain in my homie's face
And only then you'll understand why my homies bang
Strapped up, this is us, fuck a deal nigga
Gun boys be like ""Maino is a real nigga""
Yeah, me and Bust bleed the same blood
Handcuffed to the bus, we the same thugs

Balenciaga boss, bitch address me as Mister
Eat salmons and tortellini down at the Bella Vista
We move in silence bitch you better whisper
And sizzle the street with the heat until it hella blister
So much bottles, got 'em for every drinker
So much head I be callin' mami a heavy thinker
Victorious like a nigga conquered another nation
Buyin' bottles and drinkin' to drown the sufferation
Could give a fuck about your plan, watch how I handle that
If it ain't YMCMB or Conglomerate, cancel that!

I gotta tell somebody, yeah
So inspirin' when a nigga doubt
Look around and see how niggas try to count me out
Only if niggas stepped in my shoes and took a walk
And thought of shit I sacrificed I wouldn't have to talk
And I'm like a bitch's blouse on a clothesline
And treatin' how I stumbled on another goldmine
While embracin' what God be havin' for me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hah, huh
Now motherfuckin case closed
The shit blow your speaker, keep turnin' your base low
Spaz out because I motherfuckin say so
Before I blow this bitch like we down in Waco
Thick in cock diesel, that's the way we roll
Big truck shit, even my bitch whippin the Range Rov'
We 'bout to skyrocket and THE WAY WE GO
The way the bitches lookin' love THE WAY WE BLOW
Check it, we light shit up like Broadway yo
The crack-head rappers better JUST SAY NO
Before I turn stupid and back the heat slow
Lay and wait for niggaz in the back street yo
Weak flow, take your shit like I'm comin' to Repo
Create a crowd scene and stack a bunch of people
We bustin' through the doors, shootin through your peephole
The shoot that never miss is like shootin a free throw
All you niggaz better go and...

Call the ambulance, come and pick up your people
Call the ambulance, come and pick up your people
Call the ambulance, come and pick up your people
Put they body on the stretcher, carry they ass out

Fifty keys with large proportions
Caught a few niggaz on money extortions
Niggaz snitch, F.B.I. is hawkin
Call Johnny Cochran, yo this nigga is walkin'
Shit, we got to close down the club
Me and my cousin Bust, we like Crockett and Tubbs
Pushin Lambo's, big chains and dubs
Lead the Flipmode security with snubs
Uppin club levels, hundred G's and up
And if them ducks rollin' Bust I'm beatin' it up
The streets ain't safe, yo we heatin it up
The party's on smash, now we tweakin it up
The bitches want this dick so they eatin it up
[Busta] Now all you bitches better go and...

Flipmode, we in heavy conjunction
We shut it down in every function
Beat you in yo' head until your brain malfunction
Yo Bust, call the label, tell 'em we in production
Pinky ring status so it's no discussion
Stop talkin' shit, niggaz dodgin and duckin
I'm cream cheese with the English muffin
I still got respect in the Flatbush junction, HEY

Huh, it's like we shakin down a dude
We like a pack of dogs that come to take a nigga food
My niggaz flip quicker than a FUCKIN' interlude
I beat niggaz head and blood drippin through a tube
Peep bitch, I'm only here to change the fuckin' mood
And freeze you niggaz money like a nigga gettin' sued
And leave you in the church watchin your body gettin' viewed
Don't get it fucked up or even misconstrued

Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
Yo, yo, yo, I can't understand
Why the parents and the teachers
And everybody trying to o the kids
The young generation yo,
What's the deal brah, Charlie Brown, man
(Charlie Brown)
I don't know what the deal is
You hafta ask my partna Dinco D
Yo yo tell us D tell us D
Mass confusion g, I don't know what's up
Hey yo man
(It's just another case of that old pta)
Huh man
(Dinco D)
In school I wrote notes and took quotes from Shakespeare
And other types of rhymes to show you that I (care)
But things like together forever to you my only one (only one)
It was special I can say it was another one
You would say someone's knocking at my window
(Knock knock)
Someone's ringing my bell
(Ding dong)
It's about two in the morning
(Hey yo g, what the hell's going on?)
(It's just another case of that old pta)
But never the less here goes to show my potential
And even though our love was three-dimensional
One (me) two (you) three (your pops) now what am I to do
I had to transform into educated lad
Going around doing chores for your dad
Playing a duck, wearing sweaters and shoes
Chilling with pop just listen to the blues
And talking to your mom about a love for her daughter
Suggesting to me that I just oughta
Watch myself
(Inch by inch)
Watch myself
(And use some sense)
So I did
(HEY)
It didn't do a damn thing
But a case to complain, so now I sing
(It's just another case of that old pta)
(Busta)
ROAARRR Busta Rhymes the mighty infamous
Always misbehaving and mischievous
Causing aggravation I'll never pause
Pushing out spit balls through plastic straws
(In class)
In gym I got caught at last
For ligthing up the courtyard grass
(HEY)
Teacher, teacher, go to the flesh
(Busta Rhymes liked to killed the complex)
Hey yo
In class, kicked it to this girl Cheryl
(WHAT?)
The teacher try to tell me I was Pharaoh
(No no no)
I'm not with detention no no with suspension
A child's wickeddy wild the Calbridge Hill styles
Teach us just a knowledge to go talk to my mommy
Now when she gets home, she's gonna wear out the body
I hate this relationship, the mom and teacher
When she reaches home hey yo she knows that I reached ya
Ok, of today I am the new school, pray
Between my momma, teacher, and my dad hey yo
(It's just another case of that old pta)
(Charlie Brown)
Ah
Yo teachers hate me the girls don't take me
Because I'm C Brown
(Class clown)
Gettin' still Ah sometimes I chill yo
Depending on the day and (HOW I FEEL)
Sometimes I leave an apple that's rotten and (BROWN)
No where to be found
Poll tax on sheets, five days a week
Arrive in the lunchroom, I gotta get some sleep
But I didn't do it
(You did it)
I'm suspended
(You was wit' it)
And now it's time to pay for the crime
That I never got caught like Judge Wapner
(BAM! take on the court)
A room of teachers, parents, and preachers
A principal and one kid dress in sneakers
Case of brown versus the board
(Order order)
Yo twelve, verse one is a slaughter
I pleaded my case
Ah
Face to face
Ah
It was a waste
And everyone was in place yo
He announced me guilty you have
(Three hundred sixty four days)
Of detention to serve
(Some nerve)
I felt this could be from (PISSED)
The head of the board said ""case dismissed""
As I walk out the room I hear them say
Aahyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaahee

While I'm in the process of slowly gettin' rid of ya
I'm back over bitches, and then I throw 'em in my videa
Yeah, yeah, the God of the block
Y'know me killa had you spreadin the spot wet and +Twist It+ like Olivia
Oh shit, flow so sick in the committeea
We know you a slouch duke, we don't even consider ya
Boss nigga, see or hear me in ya area
The more niggas, the murders, the more the money, the more the merrier
Smash shit till everything become mass hysteria
Hungry for street shit, see I be takin' care of ya check nigga
Fuck all the talk, homey I'm daring ya
The lead from the shot'll poision ya blood like malaria
Made back and sell it over exotic
Worm skin interior, my swagger to my bitch the more money
It's all superior
(Chorus: Busta Rhymes)
When we in the spot y'know that we sure to shine (to shine)
It's all so holy and so divine
Analyze niggas till we can read ya mind

When it comes to the street shit, define me as the emperor
Check it my nigga... most of you muhfuckers amateur
I muster the nigga quick and damage any challenger
But now y'know, ""Oh a nigga flow so spectacular""
Break niggaz down and handle you muhfuckin characters
Captain of this shit but most of you niggas is passengers
I'm takin' it back to the hood, like '87 Maximas
Yeah, yeah y'know who the truth, no need for askin the, same question again
To get the same answer bruh, fasten ya seatbelt
Bitches fuck wit the bachelor
Wit' money like a thousand coke deals from here to Panama
Strike like a brightness, a light... I'm here to dazzle ya
Whole hood from the boroughs, to the niggas up in Attica
Soldiers in the streets, the Middle East, way down to Canada
When it comes to the block, y'know I'm the ambassador
Follow nobody's footsteps, but said it like a scavenger
Wanna talk money bitch!? Then holla at my manager
The way y'all niggas is trash, my crew'll get to blasting ya
Twelve shot clip, hollow tips, quick to plaster ya
All over the cement, spread ya like I'm mashing
Everything, Bus-a-Bus date... but check ya fuckin' calendar!

Take me all the way, where you are (cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)

I know you love the way I come and I scorch this
Ain't nothing changed niggas know I'm holding the torch, bitch
Excessive with the heat see how I'm holding the fort, sick
I'll twist a nigga's shit just like a fucking contortionist
It's bang bully bust rhymes, I'm coming to squash shit
Demolish every hood, disintegrating the mosh pit
Spaz, animal rap, they love when the god spit
I know you wish you could the way I bang them regardless
It's the Conglomerate in case I ain't mention
There's bitches in this building and they all in this section
To dominate this shit has been my every intention
These niggas think they sick I come and kill the infection
And when I come through you know I'm blowing the top off
The building and the club you niggas know how I pop off
And if you violate you'll probably get your shit chopped off
The way I got police barricading the block off
Sometimes I act like I do because of this voice in my head
(Voice in my head, voice in my head)
It tell me just what to do to spend a chunk of this bread
(Chunk of this bread, chunk of this bread)
You make them niggas want to say
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Them niggas psycho how they ball
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
They buying all the alcohol
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Like they just buying out the mall
(Them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)
Before I finish counting this bundle
So kindly as I welcome niggas (back to the jungle)
I'm back to run this, bitch, I strive to keeping it humble
I'm here to shake the building till it crackle and crumble
So back out bitch, see how we knocking the most hard
I'm about to split the ocean, get to calling the Coast Guard
Better call the ambulance, I'm coming to choke y'all
I'm smashing every country, bitch I'll send you a postcard
See now they acting like they ain't knowing
But I know you see exactly where the bottles is going
A couple box loads see all the money we spending
We drink until we stupid and the party is ending
Now peep the way we coming in we picking shit back up
The tunnel two thousand twelve the way the shit packed up
We full throttle in this bitch and never will slack up
While I feed you the heat watch how my niggas will act up
Sometimes I act like I do because of this voice in my head
(Voice in my head, voice in my head)
It tell me just what to do to spend a chunk of this bread

23,Decision,2009,Back on My B.S. (2009),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be all right
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
Let me talk to you, when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give ????
And though I'm blessed, I still gotta handle of things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you, and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to, and vent your frustration
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need 'em the most, are they really ever there?
See, every thing be all good when we be havin' fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it
Look at hear, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view, and being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you
I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be all right
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something that we allow that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walkin' with me going through the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate it you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out
But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out
I got a clearer view, I thank God that you're here for me and I'm here for you
I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be all right
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
I, look in your eye, and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life's changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catchin' planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of ???? trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you
I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be all right
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
I made a decision..."

Me and my nigga Richie was itchy to meet some women
Met some chickens, they was actin' so snobby and bitchy, fuck it
Pass me the sticky,
The chicky wanted to leave me with a kiss and a hickie
I ain't wit it but give me a quicky
I ain't in to doin' the licky-licky
Even though you be lookin' so pretty,
I own all of my shit, never 50-50
Oodle noodles all 'dose fools never refuse
Accuse me for the bruise
Chick outta rattle and sound, better tighten the screws
Runnin' and gunnin, kinda stunnin
The way we be comin' around, slummin', wylin and dollin
My nigga Horace kick up a nigga like Chuck Norris
Got some other niggas lost way up in the forest
Hang you up in a harness, label me and all of my niggas the hardest
Fuck around, be the next ""Formerly Known As"" artist
Layed out with a goddess, pretty lilly Adonis
Besides all of that, niggas is 'nomous, I make you all a promise
The promise is that I'm so dominant and that I am so prominent
Captured the whole of Asia as a continent
Oh shit, I be comin' and tumblin down
Rumblin, stumblin down
Freaky prophet with unusual musical sound
Bringin' the ruckus, you motherfuckers be givin' me pounds
So many sound, give me the camcorder and a city with plans
Me and my fam, hustle and tussle in makin' this groove, me and my man's
How we gon' do this? (MAKE THEM MOVE)

Yo there really ain't no equal...
Ask Hillary, met her down on Flatbush and Tillory
She killin' me, got me crazy, wylin, actin' straight grizzly
We never made it too far together,
I left her standin on Franklin and Willoughby
Another mystery to me
While she still on the corner kissin' at me, hissin at me
Ignorin these bitches, they're angry, now they're riffin at me
Vital and critical, literal lyrical, make niggas pitiful
Go to the clinical, examine your physical
Frightening and enlightening at the same time
Get the goods and price them, and doin' the heist again
You thinkin' we would be nice again
We on a mission, we don't need none of your advice again

Y'all think fast, before I get, all in your ass
Bend your frame like plexiglass
You motherfuckers, be actin' like you, don't know the half
You and your whole staff, make me laugh
Hah-hah-hah, hoh, y'all, you need to sing my song
With your similar features like Olivia Newton-John
Damn, Oh! I make the whole place warm, then
Hit you with some shit that make you niggaz look deformed
Now, stay tuned to every Busta Rhymes, coming soon
I will King Kong on niggaz like guerrilla monsoon, soon
Whoa, what seems to be the whole analysis?
Busta Rhymes just be rippin' shit, type miraculous
Bang you on your head so hard, shit be formin' callouses
Let me get this loot so we can move up in these palaces

Let let let me do my thing, hah!
When I step in the place you should keep your mouth closed
Take your fat finger out your nose
You should just pay attention, and watch how I wild on records
Make you sing, ""The Lord is my shepherd!""
In the process I do away with all nonsense
Hit you with magic like my name was Pocahontas
The dread, gon' make you party till you dead
Niggaz quick to talk shit... OOPS! Upside your head
Put your head to bed -- let me do my thing -- nuff said
Shit so hot make your chickenhead do the spread
Tell me what you said -- I said I never leave you misled
While you bullshit, I'd rather get the Lucci instead
Hah-huh-hah-hee-hah! Flip until you fall
Whylin in your whip, till you crash into a brick wall
Through the nine-six, I be that nigga that be priceless
Always blowin' up your spot, bringin' more surprises
You, you know you really need to come clean
Let me do my thing, don't you even try to intervene
I will endanger your species like an ostrich
Hold you hostage, and crazy feed you swine sausage
HAH! I be the number one chosen just to keep you open
Chill with your thoughts I got your brain frozen
Pay the prices made the needed sacrifices
To present the grand opening of Flipmode Enterprises

Before you all pass out, pass out
Hands up, hands up
Spazz out, spazz out
Nobody could do it the way we get it down nah ah
We make 'em blow their cash out cash out
Don't you love it when we come and do it again?
Pour liquor till it's filled out the glass (non-stop)
Either way we got it on snag
We don't stop until we bounce like hum
We ain't stop 'til we knock off your block
Molly watch the flyest nigga with it purposely, I sloply nob
Some will break the square, would be getting Monopoly guap
Several in beautiful cities, that property hop
Most you niggas need to probably stop
Create a lane 'cause when I come through most you'd do is probably flop
When speak chances of 3 shots, I probably pop
Shots legal 'til they nosils is hot, I'm to the spot
Now you knew Rihanna for him (I be the heat)
And we gotta put it on him (you see him in the street)
Let's go. Avatar, shit I'm lost in the zone
Might as well give me the crown bitch, I'm bringing it home
Try to hell I hit the sand bitch, I'm standin' alone
See I be like a katana 'til they bandage your bones
Why you niggas quit the block and left the shit that we bring?
Bust bottles and salute what's legendary
I wanna see you do that thing

We don't stop until we bounce like hum
I'm comin' and killin' and causin' you niggas to lose it
While a man took a challenge, this line that I'm smakin' I'm stupid
Assaultin' bad, I be the booth boy, love to abuse it
You see the high bean when I'm comin' motherfucker, move it
And so by side
You know we got that shit
We give it to him 'til we makin' a nigga say ""I got it, bitch""
And uh we don't stop, and uh we don't quit
And uh they see nose flips because we drop their nose heads
I know for Moses harder to stomach
God had to spit enough flesh in, what he do to become it
I step in the building, demolish shit, you know how I got it
The way a man showin' everything and o arguin' it
My hundred fifty thousand dollar feature might swallow your budget
And fuck the hood up boy and see how they love it
Why you niggas quit the block and left the shit that we bring?
Bust bottles and salute what's legendary
I wanna see you do that thing
Before you all pass out, pass out
Hands up, hands up

Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over!

Just tell 'em they're number one (it's over for who, numero uno partner)
You're a champion (ha ha ha, let's go Bust!)

Now, there's, nothin' you can do to stop a nigga from within
With the hunger of a lion I secure another win (hey!)
So passionate, you might even misinterpret it as arrogant
I'm goin' in (hey!)
I'ma make the world feel my pain
While I'm showin you my muscle and I hustle through the game
And even though they leave us in the hood like we ain't SHIT
We ain't got nothin' but EVERYTHING to gain
Look, even if a muh'fucker try to pop me
I'm so BLESSED - do anything that you could do to stop me (STOP ME)
Now I'm climbin up the ladder and I'm jumpin' at the top
You might wanna call me - ROCKY
See there's more of us - UGLY
You don't really wanna war with us - TRUST ME
So glorious, that we from the bottom
Still we victorious - HUG ME

At least quit lyin' if you must keep talkin'
Go on with the nonsense, best keep walkin'

Couple months off, I'll be right back shawty
With a brand new swag and a brand new .40
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it

Ain't nothin' in the work gon' really stop what you're doin' (Oh!)

Then they wave and say hello, when my Lambo' is yellow
Everything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello
See the niggaz on the corner and I never forget it
And I never regret because I see how you get it
Now because of you niggaz, I'm a hustler nigga
'Gnac guzzler nigga, rip your jugular nigga
In the night I become the type to love when it's dark
'Cause when I pull up and park, is when I'm makin' my mark
See the fact's that I'm tryin' to strive and capitalize in
Start to max-a-mimize and b-build a ent-ter-prise
And wh-while I'm stockin this bread, keep ah-stockin the lead
And leave a permanent dot, on the top of your head
(Nas)
Ill Will, Flip-mooode!
I'm the enigma, there is none harder, smarter
Martyr, Godfather, my interest, your departure
Pardon Dre this beat is a monster, catchy
Like sleepin' under open windows that's drafty
Then wakin' up my throat scratchy, that's how I spit it nasty
They short, a few inches North of a dwarf
My flow's Murcielago, ghostin them narcos
Toast in the ways of the original Pablos
Still a pyramid architect, mix liquors like a chemist
Killer lyricist, poetical tyrant
Sneaker store terrorist, Mt. Everest I climbed it
Heat is drawn, no creepin' on me whenever I'm bent
My mind spray, my nine spray
And freak styles like 3000 Andre
To keep pilin, keep pushin them drops
Nas, runnin' with hot Busta Bust, we don't stop
(Busta Rhymes)
Now I'm hot, and we runnin' the block
Watch me run in your spot, fiends comin' in flocks
Add a little cut to the coke when I'm cookin the pot
DRUGS, BITCH! I got what you want come and get what I got
Now I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop
I love to fold up a knot, love totin the glock
Helps me feel safer when niggaz try to scheme on my plot
Try to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot
See I will leave you to rot, only defendin my stock
Niggaz know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop
My hot shit; bust a cannon have you run in your socks
See we live on the edge, bang shit with a sledgehammer
Split up your head, kill a snitch for the feds
Let's go, for the streets I'm always spittin' a gospel
Get Nas holdin' a barrel size of elephant nostril"

And do away with all them niggas before I get to them first

Ready to designate at the slightest wave of a white arm
Best form of advice I could give is remain calm
The repercussion is somethin' you could never imagine would be goin' on

You best believe Busta rhymes more flavor than all the rest
From all the mess, hardcoreness from all the stress
Got to get this flawless flow from off my chest
Who's responsible for the impossible flow
Ain't a thing in the world that ain't culpable so so
I make you anticipate great
Type shape real live niggas appreciate
To the utmost I pack toast, keep the gat closed
Run niggas to the island I pack most
After the gun burst quench my blood thirst
We will be leavin' you much worse so one hearse
Yo, now we embellish fuck the jealous
And they mark on niggas now what you gon' tell us
Skydiver, short circuit just like a bobwire
And give it the niggas because we got the FIRE!
All my people in the place (Iyyiiiyyiiiiyyiiiiyyiiiii)
Just put your hands up in the air
And while we blow the spot and keep it hot
You got that FIRE!
Jump, shake, bounce when we come to you turn you out
It's Flipmode Squad that keeps on right your rightest place
We got that FIRE!
Aiyyo
Rock until I'm gone
Till the party's over and they start turnin' the lights on
Type of shit, right inside your whole crew be on
Be the bullshit, so keep movin' on
No I ain't havin' it
Why you grabbin' it, my flow is immaculate
Passionate when it comes to the fire that you have to get
Then I tackle it and kill like we Jackal and Jaffolit
Rob niggas and give it to the church so they can raffle it
Now you can distinguish how
I ???, flow in broken English
Witness how we stay hot and how we keep us goslin'
Women flawsin' blow the spot often
(WHAT) niggas say (WHAT) you need to calculate
Re-evaluate the shit off so we retaliate
Marinate, when I used to hustle and carry weight
And bust up niggas like you would have the Bleat Estate
It's the niggas like y'all I hits for only when it counts
Black on the set and make motherfuckers bounce
Connected the raw types of shit
To make your bitch bug and make niggas pull out cake
Hey I think it's whack yo, I stack dough, and pack a rap show
And then let all of my niggas in the back door
And let the spot short circuit just like a bobwire
And give it to niggas because we got the FIRE!

Taking you to the other terrain, we mash strictly for the cream
Here to kill your whole scene and your motherfuckin' team
Little 'Mal, the raw dawg, I know you heard of me
You probably know some bitch niggaz who wanna murder me
Busta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster
For me the microphone master
Look, I crash ya, bash ya skull
Fucky with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall
Niggaz talk about killin' and never get to it
Fuck the yappin', be true to it, do it
Steady scream about your East and your West side
But you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide
Niggaz better get up off that bullshit quick
Caught up in the limelight gettin' way too slick
See 'em at the shows bout to rock they shit off
Gettin' they peeps fucked up 'cause they block is soft
As for terror, I sever the best of MC's
Look, little Mally G trippin' off these indo trees
About to murder label's jerkin but mercy us
Def Squad niggaz prophesize like the Perseus
Droppin' degrees to zero with flatlines
Kill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme
One rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme
I don't give a fuck I kill 'em with just one rhyme
Woo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this
Terrorist, lyricist, for your era it's
My time to shine and I'm still payin' dues
And I'ma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker
I only tell you nothin' but the real it's
Tight up in the struggle tryin' to get this fuckin' meal, why?
Niggaz act shifty so I shift a long
Three tri three chrome, it's the same ol song
I seen the shades and the suedes from afar Pah
But hold up do you know who I are?
The M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on
You blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome
Peace with the chrome piece that I pack
Remember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back
(Verse Two: Redman)
Who the fuck I be I, you cannot see I
Flabbergasted, blasted, my Magnum P.I.
Oops I lie, I got a cannon 'bout the size of Grand Canyon
I'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing
Duck, heavens to fuckin' Merkatroid
I drop noise that employs the unbelievable
Recline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine
With a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until
You start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers
I rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender
Like bartenders mix liquor
I serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers
Manslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters
Raw water turn sons to granddaughters
Ah ha ha ha ha! I bring trouble where, you sleep
So I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat
Antidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo
MC's dosey-do your mics up in this rodeo
My star roast 'em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions
Shuttin' down national state buildings with high ceilings
Funk Doc to the spot freeze
Creepin' on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues
Def Squad representer
Hit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter
(Verse Three: Keith Murray)
Hey yo once a crack head, always a tack head
You have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead
As sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality
Y'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray
I'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously
Niggaz ain't shit to me (word up)
You stupid niggaz always got somethin' smart to say
And probably can't even spell TWA
My crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)
Jump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)
Niggaz is pussy and ways and actions show it
Most of y'all niggaz dead, and don't even know it
And Def Squad L.O.D. for life (word up, yeah fuck your life)
Act trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife
(Interlude: Announcer)
Aiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G
Redman, Keith Murray, bringin' the ruckus, the Def Squad
Next up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell
First up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout
Lord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous
Busta Rhymes

Two one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC
When I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P.
Niggaz and bitches be eyein' me
I'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame
Because I'm dangerous
I'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble
Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile *beeping*
I'm great distance like AT&T
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Yo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free
And makin' sure he see visions of me
Rampage the talk of the town
The stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)
I'm comin' thorough like a pack of Life Savers
Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak seven days a week
I'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap
I'm hittin' brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)
A hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dying to a certain extent
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack, fade away and never come back
(Verse Five: Lord Have Mercy)
For now and forever, it's the, evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor
Invader, evacuate I collapse your major
Straights and lose minds
You're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers
My maneuvers, drop like lugers
Illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings, with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin' the nine-six
For you mindless, niggaz I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Corrupt your minors, like New York City's finest
Lineups, on LSD fine dust, in your sinus
Crush like chinas, opiuMC grinders
My dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners
The infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggaz, we're like Afghanistan guerrillas
(Verse Six: Busta Rhymes)
If you want more information look listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people
My music will dominate the population like black people
Utilize my efforts to exercise my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts
Hold down the forts smokin' drinkin' mad quarts
For sports talk to chickenheads in booty lik shorts
Let's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season
Flipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down
Till they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down
Alcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin
Raw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggaz groovin'
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin'
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin'
From your conversation the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin' my nigga you about to feel the real force
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggaz blastin' off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this
I recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers
But still we travel the world like National Lampoon
It's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!
Hahahahahahahahah

While we continuously stay sculpturin bombs
Love unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggaz I'ma die tryin' for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear cryin' for y'all
Back to the foundation, takin' you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger
Starvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin' my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real
Flipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware
Too late for turnin' back my nigga 'cause we takin' it there
(Busta Rhymes)
Genesis, Genesis, Genesis
And leave!
And leave a mark until it's deep in the floor
Y'all niggaz fucked up never should've let let me get my feet in the door
And then I step through, FUCK wipin my feet at the door
I be the deacon I'm beatin' niggaz and speakin' the raw
Strictly raw shit is what niggaz be seekin' me for
Testin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step... for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like somethin' that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin' it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin' of people like the comin' of Jesus
While a lot of other niggaz don't be tellin' you nothin'
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggaz like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggaz trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggaz from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggaz to my live niggaz everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin' it there

Reviving the alarm

Scream at niggas through the intercom

High rate, I always produce the potion
Weed smoking got me moving slow motion like we floatin on relax ocean

Don't want you darkin shades, there's to much smoke up in your eye
Keep it swingin' listen to all of my bells ringin'
My get high has niggas wantin to start singin'
And this goes out to those that smoke out the bong
And all my bitches in the place who roll they own draws
Chorus: repeat 2x
Buy a nickel bag
Smoke a little lye
Get high tonight
Get high tonight
Yo, bounce back you just caught the contact African black overreact Charge
I'm bout to bench the whole wack must interact on every track
Blow this spot down niggas break fool and smoke across the world almanac

With the deal done sometimes I sip Jamaican white rum
Taste with a little milk, I know y'all niggas want some
Represent where you from needing some tic tacs and gum
So a nigga breath don't blah!
Get high, then I get fly

Smoking in the center of Yankee stadium

And still we must bring the ruckus to all you motherfuckers
Automatically, assault and battery
We battle thieves that get tragically slap to sleep to relax the beef
Collapse like weak cancerous lungs
Scatter, we numb
Blind feelin' nap with jarred villain that alarm buildings
Con scrimmage, woke up a lot of children
Dirty ass venom village

They say we make the greatest HITS
So who am I, to dis-AGREE?
I hear the streets callin, y'all was lookin' for ME
Everybody, was lookin' for one thing
You lookin' for something, well I got the something
Now every single person that was lookin' for something
Well let me give 'em what they askin fo' - HEY!
Let me give 'em what they askin fo' - HEY, HEY!
Hey - what'chu tryin' to know?
I got the sick Southside and it ain't no joke
Hot cookin, sittin' pretty, shiny smokes
Up in the fine cuisine, sup a little wine with my folks
A bunch of filthy rich niggaz that be grindin the most
Bunch of ace of spade models makin' champagne toasts
And I got, Armani suits, sick wrists on glow
A nigga back, hittin harder than a 2x4
See them diamonds, yeah I bet'cha never seen 'em befo'
Drippin off a nigga till the stones'll fall on the flo'
I'm throwin', money down the room to please myself
I'm into self-preservation so I freeze myself
See I'm so, dipped fresh I wanna squeeze myself
And do it so big sometimes I can't believe myself
No matter how hard a nigga greed my wealth
See you can front if you want, the game need my help
Now let's GO!
Hey - how you ain't gon' choke
When you see five mills hangin' off my throat?
We don't know about the drugs but you know mines coke
Couple Venezuelan bitches chillin' on my boat
Now now now, a lot of niggaz ridin' on my coat
But I don't worry cause you know the difference is mines dope
E'rytime the hood's eatin nigga they find hope
Ain't nuttin change same birdie hangin' off my rope
Now listen - I got the 50 if you all want smoke
Just put your lips up to your fingers if you takin' a toke
You see I gladly share the weed just never leave me the roach
When I get with bitches in the building they be catchin the ghost
I'm sayin', go 'head and roam girl and giggle around me
Break your shit, the shit it start to wiggle around me
So, swaggnificent the shit won't stop
Just got the crib fit with airplane lights on top
Now let's GO!
Hey - how you all gon' sleep
When a nigga like the groove but beepin on my creep
So serious, when you walk up on my street
The Violator hood niggaz busy parkin my fleet
Of vehicles from East Europe I can hardly repeat
The names of, shit is strange but it's hard to defeat
How we do it and we kill 'em till there ain't nuttin left
I finish niggaz e'rytime because we do it to death
Now let's GO!

Old dro bottles, and blow, blowin' from both zones
Layin in them Tahoes we own the projo's
Three for tenement we in the lobby with the big
(Da dun dun dun) Don't move 'cause I'm a representative
Live for the street, ask, you die in the war
'Member that -- blast that three atcha -- hide in the wall
We gangsta, republicans with them big things, big rings
Get your head shot off, daddy you don't believe chains
Loose cameras, big hammers, Station Wagon, blue Phantoms
Smokin' the block up, y'all witness the zoo gamblers
We ain't takin' no shorts, its just the early 80's
That made me, now I sit paid and then maybe
Nothing but my Lords and raps, these bags of dope
Under the mattress and I clack like a slave key
Wash your squad up, I roll double refuse to rock
Closed up my door up and murked you on the job (aww)
(Hook: Busta Rhymes)
Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggaz get like shower posse in a spec of the drug games
Slayin niggaz, steady sprayin niggaz, till the task forces roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin niggaz
Streched out, focus, see you come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with bakin soda, acquire now
Strategize, gettin' paper like the chivey Jamacians
And them George Chain niggaz, might we set up a goal?
(Busta Rhymes)
We got guns tucked in our waistlines, wit raps
Hangin' from our back pockets miraculous money nigga
Can't stop at Sherlock - Home can go's
Medallions so big wit strings you could turn 'em into banjos
Phenomenal property, drug money, scram wrap em
A hundred EX - golden like a hundred graham crackers
Sidewindin niggaz tryna infiltrate blindside
A nigga hit you wit the eight, three in the club
Dumbin out, drunk in fronta the airbrush
Backdrop ones out, five dollars for bitches wit the guns out
Juggle for a couple days close shop thinkin',
To you the bubble until the strip is hotter than a microwave
Don't stop, travel all my spare time and keep niggaz wit us
To push shit like George Jefferson Airline
No fro niggaz better go chill, 'fore this gun
Goes up your nose like coke sniffin up your nose dude
(Raekwon)
Ay yo, snoop me kid, coop me in the red room booth
And eatin Fruit Loops it's all for the loot boo
Designated hammer that'll lay ya up scrambling
Blant ninjas get 'em more popped up, and start blowin' niggaz magnums up
Caught me in the mix wit some rich soldiers, that reaction
Is a key action, black sent forty doja's up
We hunt 'em like big plans, my big man's and them
Slick as the shit breaks from outtas you, rip dip, then quakes them
(Busta Rhymes)
See I was always good at science, in the class I was hopin
Ask 'em for the chemistry temperature now I'm cookin the coke up
Used to sit and watch them older niggaz for hours
And did acknowledge to how cold water quickly harden the powder
Took your turn into somethin' big to accredit (uh)
But ya needs connect shit up from South America
Money calculations, told B.I.G. I sit up on it still
Holdin' old hundred dollar bills, wit small faces"

It's like the feelin' after watchin a couple of (?) flick
And once you hear the kid, you'll be knowin' the sound sick
Spaz in the club, watchin the crowd flip
That's when I knew the crown was up for whoever the crown fit
Nowadays while I go bag me a fine bitch
Bitch watchin my pocket, seein we wild rich
Shorty hopin we smellin nothin' like foul fish
While you swingin' ass at the devil, claimin you righteous
A lot of haters I'm knowin' you like this
While you floss unnecessarily, sippin on wild Crist'
I say LADIES, my MERCEDES
Hold fo' in the back, two if you fat
Feel it all in your gut, your neck and your back
When you step up in the club I know you know how to act
Hey SOLDIERS, get your floss on
Va-let in the lot, park the Yukon
Shorty shakin her waist, and rippin her thong
Now all my people are muggin and singin' the song, I'm sayin'
(Verse Two)
Shit still boomin in two-thousand and three
My shit still boomin in two-thousand and three
And we don't give a fuck about who you claimin to be
My jewels blind bitches where they ain't able to see
These fools try to talk just a little much to a G
They say the wrong shit, they head just might end upside of a tree
Clear my thoughts just a little, pass me a cup of tea
Takin' different constant boats, from the land to the sea
I got my paper see, I ain't doin' nuttin for free
Unless it's for the hood, it might cost you a small fee
Niggaz all in the street, whylin whippin the V
Clever from New York to Chicago back to the D
Check it, take it back like when I was flippin a ki
Bonin chicks, holdin' titties like they was Pamela Lee
You know I mastered the art and got it down to a tee
And keep it goin' add enough spice, we holdin' the recipe
Big paper we makin', all of my crew agree
Stack more and bust up a bottle of Hennessy
In case you niggaz ain't even knowin' my pedigree
Invested in resorts for the niggaz who go and ski
If you ain't know the streets is belongin to me
I get my people from the hood and then take 'em all on a spree shoppin'
While you niggaz is busy coppin the pleas
We busy blowin' frontin like you ain't knowin' my stee'
Yeah, snap yo' fingers, c'mon
(Heavy breathing)
Here we go now, yeah
C'mon"
55,Holla,2001,Genesis (2001),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"Yeah, yeah
This shit sound like...
One two o'clock in the mornin with the full moon out
Niggaz in they trucks creepin'
With a fresh box of ecstasy pills for these bitches
(Verse One)
Yeah, team select, please collect, G's connect
Thieves nigga direct the trees to the SmokeFest
Wanna take a toke? YES! The newest zone I'm in
I'm like Smithsonian nigga, fuck it call me Napoleon
Wave the torch, cut the head off the Leviathan
The terminology I'm rhymin in cause a frenzy up in Ireland
Hit ya, I'm gon get ya
And drop the bomb scripture at your barmitzvah
Yo, map shit out, blast through the speakers
With a wifebeater on, Bushe below, a new pair of sneakers
Street niggaz hang on the sidewalk, that's where I learned my fly talk
Pimp-strut, and how to skywalk
Moderatin how we establish the whole conglomerate
The way we honor it, you'll never conquer it
See how we wreck, has a global effect, on even Polish people
Young and restless down to the old and feeble
Peep them, Czechoslovakian to Yugoslavian niggaz
Be all into my bounce so don't be botherin niggaz
So NOW you should feel the whole cathedralish bounce
Put one in your stomach leave you in a fetalish crouch, nigga
My vernacular is spectacular
Strategic plans'll have you lookin' wacker than a postal office massacre
Is that so? Make moves just like a fatso
Bounce in a minivan Astro after my gat BLOW!
Aiyyo, get up, get up, get dough (get dough nigga)
Roll up, light up, and smoke that 'dro (smoke 'dro now)
Bitch shake yo' hips and bounce real slow
Niggaz rep yo' hood, I'm with that --

All my bitch-es, if you're with me (yeah all my bitches where you at now)
Yeah I see you (you know I see y'all) HOL-LA
(Verse Two)
Yeah, my whole entire mindstate deeper
Than astronomy and mathematics like Galileo
Smash you niggaz like mashed potato
Back when niggaz used to rock Ballys and Clarks
I used to watch, little niggaz shouldn't hustle nickel crack in the park
Barrels spray the brighter flame in the dark
Blood spill stain on the street, that's how niggaz be leavin' they mark
Fuckin' with diplomats who love Bailey's
Monopolize and quickly get other money fuckin' with Israelis
So solid how we be symbolic
To a handful of niggaz that be all schemin on the same wallet
Them type niggaz that be conspirin and kidnappin
Shit happens! Gun clap for you in a GIFT wrappin
You should follow how the style switch up
Like a group of religious niggaz schemin to kill they arch-bishop
You big pussy nigga actin' all hard
Call me atheist, because I don't believe in you God
It's like a grand feast celebratin' the bounce of the century
I tote the recipe quick for any type of discrepancy
Busta Rhymes the great renaissance artist and architect
Like how a Filippo Brunelleschi portrait is so hard to get
We got the obscure shit for the street
Nevertheless we split your head and your chest, now rock to the beat

Nevertheless we split your head and your chest, now rock to the beat

Scrapin these niggas and breakin their pockets to chase them out
Suddenly call your bitches to see just how they just makin' out
Fuck it, we kick the bucket and to continue to stake them out (Ha)
And in back of the crib is where we will be makin' out
Puting some shit together make it so you could all attend
Welcoming you and my nigga so we can break your pocket again (Oh Oh)

Getting addicted to candy bars I was still wicked
Drop jewels on many fools while my niggas pack tools

Wrecking shit, hit after hit, while we set the standards
Back then came leaders of the 'New it was like a dream come true

Scream at the top of my lungs until you fuckers hear me

Is dedicated to all my niggas that I love
All the niggas that held it down with me through the whole shit
From the beginning of the fort, to the now current day of the fort
From the beginning and the birth of this whole shit
To the now success of this whole shit
And all my peoples that be holdin' it down for their peoples
Ridin' with them through thick and thin, love y'all niggas
Peep it
1, 2
Everytime I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas
1, 2
All the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas
Now, this how the shit all started
Was like doctors of ? I was being conceived kinda retarded
Like, and while my moms was conceiving this beautiful baby
Doctors was the this woman's stress out of this Jamaican lady
Pops beef and straight carrying on
Nobody realizing how the god was now being born
Ayo, yo, 1, 2
While they was wildin and shit
They couldn't even find my pulse, sonogram on the frisk
So, they tried a natural birth, but had to stop production
Baby stuck all up in the womb, another malfunction
1, 2
And now the doctors discover
They had to cut this lady's gut, and c-section me out of my mother
Pop duke could only sit and ask why
Looked up in the sky and begged for mercy from the most high
C'mon, now, 1, 2
See now the day would feel blessed
Watching the birth of a precious baby life manifest
See how that bugged me out
(Over chorus)
That shit, that type shit be buggin me out 'cause...
Y'know niggas, nigga look back
To them days when you know shit is kinda ill like y'knawmean?
Nigga, niggas like fall out, y'knawmean?
Motherfuckers is, niggas live long enough to look back and shit and
Laugh and shit, y'knawmean?
Young and learnin shit that started is thick
Started inquiring alot, started using my dick
Like I knew it all but I wasn't really knowin' and shit
Buggin when my pubic hairs started growin' and shit
Now hold up, a young nigga now a couple years pass
Searchin desperate to experience my first piece of ass
Now, gettin' into mischief and caught my first arrest
Started smoking weed and started totin on them cigarettes
Eyes bloodshot like I was starin' at a highbeam
Nigga only twelve so why he lookin' like he nineteen?
1, 2
The fast life baby, young with an old soul
From the past life baby
A young nigga wanted things and wanted money quick
Ambitious on the Amtrak, wit a quarter brick
My nigga, 1, 2
It got hot in the streets
My nigga campaign the cops who started walkin' the beat, my nigga
Trouble causin too much problems just me and my brother
Made mommy a grandma and shacked up with my babymother
Now it a seed, I was always ready to clap shit
Strugglin, so then I start fuckin' 'round with this rap shit
Moved to Long Island and got up with a few niggas
Believin we could show the world we was the Leaders Of the New niggas
A crew of niggas that was hot like an infirmary
Blazin' till they started actin' like bitches internally
So now, Flipmode is how we own it fo' sho
Tried to fuck with niggas but I couldn't do it no more
Fo rilla, 1, 2
And then I got with some niggas
Always wit it to multiply the gross and double the figgas
And then I, hit with bombs and hold a stack in my palms
Whippin Bentleys, floss icy shit and take care of moms
Give the local little old man a job as my chaeuffeur
Hold it down for all my niggas till the movement is over
It's kinda beautiful
CHORUS repeats to end
(Over chorus)
Yeah, y'knawmean?
How we have acquired so much
Where we can look back and, and actually laugh and lavish
In the, in the, in the moment
As we prime in life
Look at how we, we struggled all this way and went through the bullshit
Motherfuckin, little obstacles
Situations they try to set up for niggas to fuckin' fall off
And lose they hard earned shit, y'knowmean?
I holds it down for my niggas though
Give my last to my niggas
All the niggas that was wit me through the whole shit
Love y'all niggas, word
My Flipmode niggas, man"

See my swagger sharp like that, these niggas amaze me
As a matter a fact just salute me and praise me
Enough of that.

Walk around lookin' like our shit don't sink
Ice by my neck so bright, watch 'em blink.
Okay, now I got me a clear view
I like it when you get up & I'm lovin' your hairdo
The way you cross your legs, ass spread in the chair you
The way your clothes skimpy, so it's easy to tear through
Appreciate my presence, while I shine wit' a barrel
I came up wit' cut diamonds, obscure in a rare blue
Shorty ain't checkin' for you, step to the way I do
Super senile, I ain't the one to compare to

We been together for a few years
Shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames
Like sugar plum and Pooh Bear
I'm always on the road
I'm hardly ever home
Always busy this busy that
Can't talk on the phone
I know you aggrevated
Walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short
How long can you tolerate it
Listen ma, I'm just motivated
I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now
Hey, yo, to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express the words
How much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man never above you
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And that ill shit about it
We gon' sex every day
But when we sex we tease
In a passionate way
I love the way you touch it
Those little elaborate ways
Got the guard feelin' released
To relax for the day
It's on you, ma
Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you

To talk the truth to you
Listen, I'm never home

Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigga-ma-ro
I never meant to put a thousand pounds
Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me
We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from Lucy's and buses
To fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas
To Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats
We like scull and mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older
Baby, if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Yes, you know I'll die for you (Come on)
And you know I'll ride with you (Come on)
I will always try with you (Ah)
And give ya my love and cry with you (Let's go)
I will climb a mountain high (Aha)
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me (Alright)
This is where your love is supposed to be (Tell me)
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA, you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats, ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world you never leave me
Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things you do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy

I-iiii-iiiih, I never thought
Thaaaaaaat I, could fiiiind (excuse me miss)
Someone, so special (can I have a word wit'chu baby)
(Busta Rhymes)
Miss can I get a second to speak and quietly mention
That I am so into who you are, can I get your attention
My observations of you creates conversations for you
And if you got a little time, I got the patience for you
Okay? Good, you givin' me the time to talk?
While I figure it out and sort what I'm tryin' to say, let's walk
Just tryin' to keep it gutter, respectfully I won't stutter
Don't you agree, we look better when we walk with each other?
I've seen you many times, yes I've encountered many dimes
I'm feelin' somethin' special with us, it's just one of the many signs
I think that we have to look forward to our go-through
Any war with you regardless what it is I'm tryin' to score with you
Sometimes I think and wonder especially through rain and thunder
If I'd ever find the one to ride when I'm on top or under
Until we reach the end, ma with love as I be your friend
Oh; here you can take my number, I hope we can speak again
(Chorus One: LaToiya Williams)
No matter how mister, no doubt I'll die wit'cha
Until the end of life, lay down on the ground wit'cha
I'll give my life to you; I hope it all comes true
Ready to start for you, I give all my heart to you
And when together I hope we never fall apart you know
Now that it feels so good; our thoughts are understood
(Busta Rhymes)
I'd like to learn from ya, but I'm 'bout to turn from ya
It's been about a week and I ain't even heard from ya
Is it somethin' at all or did I just bump in and fall
And even though you did I see how you was reluctant to call
But it's nothin' to crawl before we walk (Ooh) listen
And it's nothin' to stall before we talk - look
To tell the truth I'm happy I found you and that I can be around you
And thus I'm diggin you, I ain't just tryin' to pound you
I'm only tryin' to crown you and wife you and wedding gown you
Regardless what I'm with, shorty seem like she always down to
Just spend a little time and then CLICK, you know that kind of chemistry
The recipe to then SIP, and a little bit of wine
Mami I like your kind that light the fireworks and bombs up
The type of chick I wanna talk about when I call my moms up
Until the love is empty I credit the one who sent me
The most BEAUTIFULLEST woman and she ridin' with me
(Chorus Two: LaToiya Williams)
(I'll do it all) I'll do it all wit'cha, go through any door wit'cha
It doesn't matter I will, go against the law wit'cha
Just know you live through me; your love is all I need
If you ain't know you make me, no one's ever shown you baby
To tell the truth {?} you've got me goin' crazy
Your love so real to me; and that's all that I, can see
(LaToiya Williams)
This is a thing I wanna feel forever, and I ain't goin' nowhere
Cause you mean so much to me
No matter how my people try to doubt ya, I know the truth about ya
It doesn't matter to me
Baby I love you and I always told ya, I'm always here to hold ya
Cause you do so much for me
No matter how they try they can't deceive us, nothin' can come between us
Cause you mean so much to me
(Busta Rhymes)
Listen; trust me and I will trust you, I ain't into tryin' to fuss boo
Deeper than any lust, I'm only tryin' to mindfuck you
That's probably why and maybe I can nickname you my baby
Now that you made me a man you're officially now my lady
Despite the stormy weather I cherish your love forever
And nourish everything we have till we grow old together
I'll never trick you, mislead or try to be shaky wit'chu
I only wanna make all the rest of my babies wit'chu

I want everybody in here to stand up on your feet
Turn my music up
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise
I want everybody in here to stand up on your feet
Aye, where's Spliff at?
There's about to be a problem now nigga
Once I captured the soul of the street it's so hard for me to let go
Respect down at the techno, hear the stadium echo
Now it's reaching a vile when the weakness is silent
Putting the fear of God in 'em while I'm shifting the climate
The gladiator presence, everything about me giant
This the year of the dragon with a heart of a lion
Got 'em throwin' their swag up, how I come to provide it
Now we makin' 'em riot till we makin' 'em try it
You can never deny it, how I came to prescribe it
Then bangin' with the ship like Earth and Jupiter collided
Then I came, I'm remindin' em, of how the spark ignited 'em
And conquered continents the size of Easy times five of 'em
And while I ride for them, you think it's loud to them?
I give pride to them and get it rough with them
I hate the street that with you, it smell like earth burn
I captivate 'em with my first words, everybody
(Shout, shout, I'm talking to you)
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise
(Holla!) back to applyin' the pressure
Bother your corner stretcher, hot like a lot of pepper
Most of you niggas off, cotton and polyester
You know how I know all, legend like Robert Nesta
You know I'm out to get you, take all the robs count
And power to the Billies, couple cigar lounge
See how I make it pop? Knockin' them all down
Watchin' them all drown, this how the love sound
Your swag off, you know you really need to look around
And try to find it nigga, searchin' the lost sound
But I welcome the hate, my mother prayin' for me
Got too much money to count, my niggas winnin' for me
Let me appraise you closely
They can't believe the way we busted up like it's not the problem is we just playin' homie
And when we in the spot, there won't be no delayin'
Only to collect another trophy, now the haters say it for me

To make some noise
To make some noise
To make some noise

Until it's to late and they realize that a body part is bleedin
Instead of bein out and enjoyin the people they be actin' all tough yappin and bluffin
Instead of bein all peaceful the partially thugs be spreadin like cancer
Frontin like gangsters until you bust their head and they lookin' like dancers
While they leanin and the rockin' with after

Cause now you got the bouncer stoppin' the door
Can't let nobody else is gettin' in 'cause we moppin the floor with ya

Make Funk-Master Flex say yo I'm feeling these
Flows make you shit in your drawers. Change your dungarees
Smoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munchies
Bowed down the block eating food at Luigi's
Constipated... too much extra cheese
Well anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's
I met some Siamese twins from overseas... Lebanese
Let's begin with the friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend. She was straight Black-Portuguese
Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, Aloe Vera-lese
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick you would kill for to get between the knees
Yo. I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe, the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys
And rob me for my G's
Had to show this crazy broad, I mastered my Degrees and my Ph.D.s
Got your face on camera; motherfucker say cheese
You better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze
Getting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees
I caught that ill vibe, Tip (Word, Bust?) Yo, yo, word
That ill vibe, Tip (Word, Bust?) Yo, yo, word
'Cause when I'm in the place you know my shit be absurd.

I got weight on my shoulders in the form of this beat
Ain't nothing sweet, on the street, for good these I compete
Come off complete
And you need to get back in your stance
We enhance and we're playing the whole world circumstance
So do good in your hood even though you puff life
Positive to comply
Don't screw up facing that crowd
Progress don't fall back. We can't have that
I'll hold your hand Black
We can't wind up with scratch
I put my best foot forward, when I play in life
Cause this world as I live it, chill's like a double edged knife
In the jam we regulate, 'cause we organize
Logically thinking when along's enterprise
A lot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab
Peace to the West Coast and the East, we's fam
Need I make mention that the crew we've got
Make things get hot, like the FoFo shot. Blauw!
No we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek
In the world that we live calmness is viewed as weak
So, we got to stay awake for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the force and build rounds with our friends
Why's that?
So we can live right until time ends
Yo why's that?
I estimate, so we can get these ends
Yo true that?
Busta and Tip, you know we make minds bend

Take us ALL through the ghetto - my nigga Rick James!
(Rick James - sampled from ""Ghetto Life"" + (backup singers))
When I was a young boy, growin' up in the ghetto!
Hangin' out on corners, singin' with the fellas
Lookin' for the cute chicks, tryin' to find me big fun
Lookin' for some trouble, or anyone who'll give me some
I was young and crazy! (In the ghetto)
Didn't know what my life would be (In the ghetto)

Police provokin muh'fuckers we dancin
And we be dodgin them bullets they be poppin' off at us, shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood till somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry - hey nigga we playin' for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See niggaz from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle till we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doin' crime
I see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me

And get to hustlin as hard as you could (In the ghetto)
Until your cake stackin shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (In the ghetto)
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And them piss in elevators till the lobby all smelly (In the ghetto)

Daddy, can I sing this song, please?
Thank you.
Hush other rap for niggas, don't you cry
Flip Mode is back and you are gonna die
Now they are niggas and they make it sound good
It can be alot safer, when they move off the hood
It's too late for you to try to call a truce
You tell him and your nigga like the cipher on lose
Better watch your head
You better watch how you talk
Watch me sleep, watch me walk
Always beware of a choice you make
Every time you click every route you take
Crazy shit of you every time I had to talk
I get real pass, since the fallin' of New York
Now we sayin' shit I never thought we'd say before.
If you would realize It Ain't Safe No More.
If you would realize It Ain't Safe No More.
If You would realize It Ain't Safe No More.
(Busta Rhymes:)
Yeah, unfortunately for alot of you muh'fuckers
We 'bout to wet up in your shit
And give it to you in the way that you might not be prepared to deal with
What it is, what it is.
And It Ain't Safe No More!"

Has determined... that the sounds you about to hear...
Can be devestatin'... to your ear... to your mind...
To your body... to your soul!
(Chorus: Flipmode + Meka)
You better, pack up your bags, better get out of town
'Cause when the God come you know he gon' be puttin' it down
Everything we do be blowin' better get on the ground
It Ain't Safe No More... It Ain't Safe No More... Nigga.
He keeps it wicked by creatin' the sound
That make the people wanna spaz till they give him the crown
Fuck around you'll turn up missin' just to never be found
It Ain't Safe No More... It Ain't Safe No More... Nigga.
Bodies'll turn up missin' I promise you need to listen
Abolish the need for bitchin' I polish and shine and glisten
Demolishin' while I'm whistlin' astonished while your witnessed
Hardest to smash another artist son, regardless if it is
A nigga who think he the greatest son I'll lock him in the fridge
And hang him from both of his ankles when we drop him from the bridge
Blockin' your paper really stoppin' that dude from gettin' his
Poppin' the safe and splurgin' havin' the crew up in the crib
Block till these niggas havin' 'em rockin' gargle with a bib
Shitin' and fartin' spittin' and vomitin all in the crib
Fallin' into shock from the bullets we shot up in they ribs
Hot up the block and blew up the spot and got up out the mix
Tried it a couple stops and spotted the Squad up in they whips
Plotted and then I signed on the dotted line and made a wish
Return us even the hardest makin' you garbage niggas sit
The smartest now you a target only the heartless niggas win.
(Chorus: Flipmode + Meka)
You better, pack up your bags, better get out of town

It Ain't Safe No More... It Ain't Safe No More... Nigga.
You can't believe can you, I'm callin' my dog Nathaniel
And ballin' with all my man's you'll be blowin' and all will hand you
Accordingly or disorderly bullets are sure to bang you
Considerably my 9 milli hit you at any angle
Shootin' shootin' shootin' - high, low, verticle or horizontal
And if you were makin' plans I do think you gon' have to cancel
Sorry I had to ask you, save it I have to blast you
Takin' a chance to laugh from you makin' the masses gas you
So now you thinkin' that you tough and that we can't get at you
Change up your mind and leave you stiffer than a massive statue
Tired of talkin' need to use all your precautionary measures
Washin' off the blood haulin' the water force of steady weather
You can handle it or you can't, it be only gettin' better
Like a candle, we burn your chandles and make you feel the pressure
Cockin' it back, articulatin' the flow just like a lecture
Break it down and rebuildin' the flow, now peep the architecture.
(Chorus: Flipmode + Meka)
You better, pack up your bags, better get out of town
'Cause when the God come you know he gon' be puttin' it down

Fuck around you'll turn up missin' just to never be found
It Ain't Safe No More... It Ain't Safe No More... Nigga.
It ain't safe... in the current state... of our democracy
Terrorism... muthafuckers bombin New York... shit is crazy

Let me talk to you baby
I've got some shit to share we your freaky ass, ha
I like the way you freak it baby, I love your style
The way you stick your tongue in my mouth and act wild
The way you give me them little fights and little tussles
Bite the back of your neck weaking your leg muscles
The type of chick who always want to take it there
She don't care, ready to fuck anywhere
Make a nigga want to bust till my legs cripple
Put your breasts in my face, tell me bite the nipples
You got me breathing hard, the whole shit
Kiss me on the chest, my belly button
Baby, start to kiss the whole dick
Strap you up, one time
Slap your ass up, two time
And watch you jingle
I love the way your whole ass wiggle
The way she turning me on and make my little freak wanna giggle
Before the dick paid the pussy a visit
Grabbed the pussy from the back a stuck my fingers all in it
Have you ever went over your freak's house to chill
And the both of you understood
That y'all could chill with the talking 'cause y'all were straight fucking
And for both of y'all, it's all good
Sometimes you try to play it off but you know you can't
Now a nigga dick hard like wood
You tried the macaroni-salad-the-sweet-pussy-delight
I'ma fuck it every time I could
My freak start stripping
I take a closer look, her pussy dripping
Flipping, you know I ain't tripping
Got my heart skipping, anticipating the fun
Baby, kiss the dick one more time and start the dick suck
I like the way you lick it, the way you suck it
The way you tell me you want the right dick to fuck it
The dick rest upon the pussy right here like wool
Grab my ass and pull, say you want your pussy whole full
Now talk the dirty shit, I like it like that
The way you swing your waist and throw all the pussy back
Baby got me all in the pussy, I ain't joking
She turning round, bending over, spreading her ass wide open
Oh yes, so I can get all in
She say she like the way the dick make the pussy feel from deep within
And when it slip out, she stick it right in
I love her just the way she is and how handle her biz

Phenomenal swing like the ass on a black chick
Fat dick to all of y'all niggas with whack clicks
Hoping they whip paper like a classic
Low budget black flick
Last victim that I caught was fucking my last chick
She hit me off, nearly made me bust through my plastic
Took the loot that she had stashed in her panty elastic
She got from out my denim, little venom was fast, kid
Try to swindle a nigga by giving me putang
A new thang, chick wanted to fuck me to Wu-Tang
Thug chicks started criticizing my new slang
Started hitting the pussy the song from the wusang
Watch these rap niggas get all inside your guts man
My nuts hang
Shorty stay abusing the love thang
Gotta camouflage my stash and loot like I'm Bruce Wayne
After my money gotta kick the bitch up like Liu Kang
Aiyyo
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what we asking for
Oh yeah
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what we asking for
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Okay
Shorty took me on a ride like a cyclone
In my zone
Strutting with an ass and a fly tone
Hold shorty like how I be holding my microphone
We thug romancing to the jazzy sound of a xylophone
Ass backwards I'ma stick you more than a cactus
Lay my thug willy actress across the mattress
Knock it off the earth axis and broken glasses
Continue when she make me bust blackberry molasses
Pussy made me feel like I was drugged up on morphine
My movie screen ass stacking more than we've all seen
Yo, chick 'bout to make me wile on her real hard
A real fraud, fuck I ever fucked with this ill broad
Chick still after my loot, she like, ""What, son?""
Don't act dumb scheming on a robbery outcome
Come out from wherever you are and be outdone
Acting like you about something
And you ain't about none
Come on son
Thought the chicken head was a little rude
The wrong move making me whip it out like live dude
Fuck that trick tried to get at my hard-earned stack
Too many times
Gotta put my foot in her ass crack
June for all of my niggas you know shit is all real
A chicken head to fuck your man's and cut him a side deal
Of all your prized possessions if you let her get yours
Bitch we keep it raunchy everything will remain raw
Ay Yo
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what you asking for
Oh yes
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what you asking for

Fuck, my niggas is at?
Where my Leaders Of The New School niggas is at?
Yo, aiyo C Brown, C Brown where the fuck you at, dun?
Aiyo Milo, Milo and the dance, where the fuck you at, nigga?
Aiyo aiyo Dinco, where you at, son?
Where the fuck my Leaders niggas is at, man?
Fuck man, I'm ready to grab my niggas
Them niggas need to go to blow or sometin
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Runnin' faster than the speed of a bullet)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
(Has more rhymes than any other DJ that has craps)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Able to leap sucker MC's in a single bound)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Look at the jam of the mic)
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along (It's the L-the O-the N-the S)
Verse 1: Dinco, Milo
Three in this to grass it up like me
Besides TNT, see an N and BG
My visionary which is skippin on my D-O-G
I guess it was a S-O-S from G-O-D
Chaos has arisen interteller space souls (SOULS!)
Cellular, good ridance, like keypads wit ol' bass
Third planet states while the rest of the world waits (WAITS!)
Joy to the world, meaning hell, snow and earthquakes
Participates, modulates
If comets were round plates, bitten names gates
For only those that ???? relates, case after case (CASE!)
Dinco's on the next space
Movin strategically in the Solar System's waste (RAHHH!)
Size 25, the lymph still be in place (HAHHH!)
Stretch and extending, for flexin is impending
It's not mind-bending or *?refriending?* to keep remembering (HMMM!)
'Cause everybody's people gonna die, or believe (WOO-HOO!)
We dispense necessity, to shout and receive
Keep it movin' along
People in the party, are you really feelin'?
We ain't seein eye-to-eye so you ain't really seein (SEE!)
I be hippin all type of niggas, sayin' fuck that nigga Blow
When they see me in the party, they better act like they know
YO, we connectin dots that makes spots hot
Uh, to the beat'cha (Y'ALL!), ah ya don't stop (STOP!)
Notice, how many groups can formulate then lose focus
With a lot of hocus pocus, concepts that sound bogus
I'm seein the world and all its different kind of poses (WOO!)
Crush you like roaches, that's keepin' the crowd movin (HA!)
Mr and the dancers, who said ""Culture consumin?""
Never face, he ????? ????? and strength
'Cause I can terminate, like a dirty hypodermic needle
My vision's clearer than the sights on an eagle
Stop them bustin' high, bring the head back to my table
Don't front, circle circle, dot dot, you catch your speed, not
Feel that, 'cause this type of vibe sounds done
(Far from the..., to the doe-run-run-run to the doe-run-run)
(YES!) Yes to the beat-boys and your ass accepted
Exclusive, L-O-N-S bringin' the ruckus, wild aggressive
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Verse 2: Charlie Brown, Busta Rhymes
Now don't get me wrong, CHILL!
Let me out, no question, no doubt
????? God is a drought
I've come to wet the party like a tropical depression
????? Mixed with scherm for this musical session
(STOP!) stressin, testin, second-guessin, who's 'fessin?
Life is a lesson in disguise like a blessin
Blinkin, kickin, better back up chickens
The guns stun split, I keep it real, front *?worm?* (*?WORM!?*)
'Cause I'm like a ???? hands therapeutic
Measurements, square, feet, and cubic
We're all makin' pennies off a record, so who needs the paper? (WHO?)
The man in Manhatten lampin in the skyscrapers
How much can a nigga take before he break fool?
I tell ya cool, with the New School
And the tool to examine my unorthodox pattern
>From Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn
And don't forget Uranus, Neptune and Pluto
Flow deeper than the lava inside a volcano, bro
(Never snitch, never dominate
I'll be wild, smokin' drowsy)
Fuckin' up my economics, is it rather ironic
Sippin gin, juice and tonic
Like Shawn Kemp with some hemp, super sound and sonic
Baby, above your head, below your feet and it still wimp
C-Boogie Brown, my shit is brilliant
Yah yah, yah (Ah!)
My shit be so ginamic
And I'ma take 4 steps and cross the whole Titanic
Better believe I (KEEP!) movin (OVER!) people ?????
You know my crew funk, bringin' in full flaga'
Bringin' it back like I'm fresh out the box, pair of broke ass 69ers
(IS THERE NUTTIN NEW?) All in the house so open up your blinders
Yo, I be the Moses takin' poses
When the wine flows so beautiful like a large bouquet of roses
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin'
Verse 3: Busta Rhymes
Keep it movin now
No need to try to stop it, we gon' wreck shit anyhow
Your, limitations is somethin' I never will allow
When we bake the cake, I be that nigga that brings the icing
Disregard your whole identity and revoke your driver's licence
You know I blast in your ass real fast
Got your bladder burning, desperate for a bathroom pass
My ????? like a Busta Rhymes statue made of grass
C'mon, hypnotise some ass, shit so hot, better jump in the water, nigga
(Splash!)
Breakin fools at parties like a ruckus sound class
Make a philly down the back and mix the weed with more hash
I will wash away your pain like Draino
Erupting like the angriest volcano, or the wickedest whirlwind and tornado
We stay up in the streets, cruisin, me and my whole crew, gotta...
Keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin'
This one goes out
To the three brothers that I love the most, in memory of this song
My man Ratto, my man Big Joe, my nigga Love
Them niggas rest, most comfortable
Peace, L-O-N-S, forever"

Coming with another all night thriller (Yo yo)
Shit bang through your bass kicker
Don't want the hot shit to boil you move quicker
Should've made the club crowd a little thicker
Nigga in a club fronting like a killer
You ain't eating my nigga you lookin' thinner
Now you a sinner a partier beginner
You better off if dance to who got the keys to my beamer
You a killer but you never pulled a trigger
How that calculate money yo how you figure
Yo, another homerun hitter my nigga
Yo we ain't over hit you with a refiller
We keep it moving never label me a quitter
Flipmode baby you could call me flipper
She wildin we wildin along with her
My nigga put me on told me she a stripper
Fronting like he don't really wanna be with her
He told me handle my business 'cause he already did her
He says she used to be Lucy babysitter
Fuck a sloppy second hit the highest bidder for realla
Keep the champagne in the chiller
Keep it cold while I hit you with another wig-splitter"

82,King Tut,2012,Year of the Dragon (2012),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"Ya got nerve, little nigga
See me when I pull up to the curb, little nigga
My money absurd, little nigga
While I count it all, please do not disturb, little nigga
Hey, these niggas got it mixed up
Watch how they bring us all them bottles of that pink stuff
Look, you niggas better get your chips up
You already know my style nigga, King Tut
My money pound nigga, King Tut
You could see it in my smile nigga, King Tut
My jewelry look wild nigga, King Tut
Who else be riding through the town in a Brinks truck
Yo, yo, see the way I take over Casinos like De Niro said
Reachin' money short, watch how it fold up like a Hero bread
Nigga thought he was a Super-friend, now that hero dead
Try to cross this shit, we represent, but that's a zero dread
All of this money I be countin'
And my cup runneth over like a fuckin' water fountain
Any nigga trynna front, I'mma show them shit that's ugly
Throwin' bread until they jealous of your money, lookin' funny
Hold up!
And body shit, that's what a monster do
See me throwin' this money and bitches like a sponsor do
Put the gloves on and beat up a nigga like I'm Kostya Tszyu
And fuck the talkin', just bring me my money like a prostitute
Ya got nerve, little nigga

Okay, I'm ridin' through your city, blowin' diddies of that icky
Got your wifey in the passenger, I'm ridin', now she lick me
I get money like Mark Cuban and know my bank is heavy
And I grip the 31 like Jason Terry when I'm shootin
ATM in my jeans, bank sittin' on my left thigh
Burn a mansion down and watch it coverin' my left eye
Girl on deck, I just whipped another lick
Now my trap look like black Friday, twelve AM in front of Best Buy
Haha, sour got me all sedated
Niggas lookin' at me angry, what's with all the smiley faces?
My deniro like Shapiro, I see Johnny Cochran wages
I'm no lawyer, but they only bring them bottles by the cases
Ya got nerve, little nigga

Okay now stupid ass stacks in my pocket
Test me, best be faster than a rocket
I ain't got no time if it ain't about a profit
If you send me my deposit, I will have your city rockin'
I get the hottest beats, niggas wish that they could rhyme on it
I got the hottest watch, ain't even set the time on it
The way I'm killin' niggas it look like a crime, don't it?
I got the light, with a little bit of lime on it
Okay, now stupid ass stacks in my pocket
Whip clean, jet ski attached to the Charger
Bitches want attention and I tell 'em try harder
Got 'em doin' shit I know that's gon' be disgracin' they father
Okay leggo

83,Legend of the Fall Offs,2006,The Big Bang (2006),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"(Death; portrayed by Busta Rhymes + sounds of a shovel digging + a heartbeat)
Yeah I know
A lot of you niggaz don't plan on the day when you'd have to see me
You see - I'm that nigga that you should really be afraid of
I dig graves for niggaz like you
We gon' get more acquainted at a time when you least expect it
(Chorus 2X: female singer)
Do you ever think (do you ever think)
What life would be (what life would be)
Where you will go (where will you go)
After you die (after you die)
[Death] You fucked up nigga!
(Busta Rhymes)
You know that when that time comes and nobody is checkin'
And everything you had is gone in the split of a second
That's when it starts hittin the fan and it gets real in this bitch
Just face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit
Despite I talk about it, I ain't makin' fun of them niggaz
I give thanks 'cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggaz
Can't imagine how difficult it is, I know you suspect
That shit around you is lookin' dumb, it's gettin' hard to accept it
Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile
Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while
Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
Continue frontin, like it's nothin' while you live in denial
While all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
You overexert the little you have left to save face
You tryin' to hide your expression from lookin' worried
On what to do when your career is buried
(Busta Rhymes)
Niggaz ain't GIVIN' a fuck about your flows no more
You ain't the star you were, fuckin' the same hoes no more
Promoters ain't payin' and bookin you for shows no more
You ain't whippin the Range, you ain't whippin a Rolls no more
Reality starts to settle in, you're sweatin every wake up
You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to Jacob
You run around and you front like you're still on fire
But nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
You're onnly lyin' to yourself 'cause it's evident in the proof
As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
You're still holdin' on to them days when everything was about you
But niggaz don't even remember you enough to just shout you
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
People see you and it's bugged that you mean nothin'
You doin' shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin'
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't gettin' in
Forgettin you a man first, chasin the fame
Got to remember, morals and principles, reppin your name proper
But most niggaz don't, and they whole life hurried
What do you do when your career is buried
(Death; portrayed by Busta Rhymes + (Busta Rhymes))
Okay
I told you we was gonna get more acquainted
At a time when you least expect it nigga
I'm here to lay you to rest once and for all [coughing]
You've been dead a long time but you refuse to accept that shit
But it's okay [coughing]
Nigga shut the FUCK UP AND GET IN THE BOX NIGGA! (WAIT! Please!)
It was custom built for all niggaz like you [lid closes]
You just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up
(Stop! BITCH!) See you in the afterlife nigga (Wait! HELP!)
Whever the fuck that is! (somebody help!)
(I can't breathe, nigga!)
(Open this shit nigga!)
(OPEN THIS SHIT! [knocking])
(OPEN THIS SHIT! [knocking])
(Busta Rhymes screams incoherently)
(Somebody help! hey!)
(Open this shit motherfucker what you doin')
(Open it!)

Niggas follow how we bounce in the truck
Then we whylin and we thugging a little
Yo we ain't wylin' much
A little mellow from the spark of the dutch
Down shift, throw it in the fifth gear with my foot on the clutch
Speed balling, like we all in a rush
While we switch a couple of lanes
Flick my little hazard light on
Better pull over and get on the lawn
Yo, move the barricade, and let my niggas park on the block
Make a grand entry up in the spot
You know we only here to take all of the food out the pot
It's only right cause niggas know we be taking they slack
Now let's get high, and let's get drunk
You feel that bounce, then turn it up

Follow the simple flow that'll cripple y'all niggas
Drop the shit that'll shake and just ripple y'all niggas
What, your boom scheme, get with the new thing
Hit you and get y'all niggas, all into the new swing
Ah, tally it up, rally it up
From the streets to the alley, from the Eastern Cali and up
I'm talking dope, all of my niggas, all of my bitches
Give you something that'll split you up
And leave you with stitches
Looking pathetic, I hit y'all niggas with the kinetic
Make you respect it, and beat you in the head till you get it
Take off my jacket, hope you can match it
When the DJ go scratch up the bounce
I hope you could catch it
So what

But I love the way your flesh and spirit manifest your beauty
Smile pretty, ass bigger than my whole Jacuzzi
This my city, have a seat and let me show the movie
Hmm, but I don't like it when you try to fight
Goin' through the love and hell for shit to turn right
Instead of turnin' left, that's when the pain stick
See I don't like it when yo' ass try to talk shit

I scratch my head thinkin' on what else I love about ya
So many different things, sometimes you drive me crazy
But what I love the most, is how you love my baby

I don't like when you get jealous and be actin' spiteful
Emotional and over-zealous got me feelin' stifled
See I don't like the way you black when you be on your cycle
Hmm, I think about when you be slackin' up
And you get weak, see I don't like when you be actin' up

Come with them classics and make it look easy and then I
Make me this money and spend it so freely and Jedi

Entirely, too turnt up my mind is
Focused on money like the IRS is
I pull up in a scratched Lexus with Texas
Tags, so many bricks I cause erections
Lethal injection, electric necklace
(Bling) flexing so check that off the checklist
I'm hungry, I'm eating rappers for breakfast
Respect, one verse will leave you breathless
I'm rapping on a Biggie beat, they didn't expect it
Fucking with me, expect the unexpected

Respect it to the max
Can't mix up or tamper with it no more
We're on the highest form of emotion, holy sacred and pure

The way she cherish me
Fulfil my every appetite
With a good degree?
Or the ways to inspire or encourage me
The right amount to nourish me
Secure enough so I don't have to ask her where my loving went
When times is hopeless
Sometimes I had to focus on the priceless moments
When my wisdom by,? went by unnoticed
'Cause you're my everything

The one way we agree on how to follow tradition
This one family coming first
Play your position
You make the sacrifices, I make the same too
The mother struggle
That I see, that's why my love is for you
You always hold it down for me, so I'm a hold it for you
And watch the babies while you secure the food that come through
Now don't let my ambition make you feel like competition
We should both play a role in our whole living condition
True indeed
I know you symbolise the strength inside the family
Then show me you can handle womanly responsibilities
Not a problem I know you hold me down when I fall on the ground
But make sure when you bring the food home there's enough to go round
And because you are my everything what's mine is yours

96,Outro,2000,Anarchy (2000),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"Yeah When I step in the spot, motherfuckers say ""who that?""
Big Bun B, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man (damn!)
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Cushion, my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the twenty ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with DA so you know what it is
I'm sittin' on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps that are holding back let's go!
Look who crept in with automatic weapons,
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em'
Track record goes back to ""The Essence"",
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man, attested,
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
But I'm like a gastric bypass,
Bunch of Nas African actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since sixteen I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow,
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit,
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon,
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden,
I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected,
Chowed down now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs,
Bust louder than the noise I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin' testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry the eighth, guillotine to ya neck, bitch!
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since ninety one
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude, studied cowards that made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food,
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne, let them niggas hate
I love my nigga Drake say ""we ain't got time to respond to niggas""
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa
Blood gang, five! It's that Blood gang, five,
But green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie,
They run they mouth, they ain't gon' fight
They actin' like they ain't gon' die
Until I let them llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die,
From Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it's no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!
They say I'm underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin'
""There he goes again!""
See now they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
Now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake 'em when I come and shake 'em
And bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain't no fakin', ain't no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin' up
Everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (Damn!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for,
You apostrophe bitch?
OK, now enough of that, see now I'm out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic
With Tha Carter IV"
97,Outro (Preparation for the Final World Front),1997,When Disaster Strikes (1997),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"And I'm once again, like to sincerely, thank to everyone for taking time out to analyze this new LP, and be eyewitness to another precious moment well spent with BUSTA RYYYYMESS! And the whole, entire FLIPMODE SQUAAAAAAAAD. and once again as we continue to keep you all motherfuckers posted there's only two years left from here to 1998 and I sincerely hope that all you motherfuckers are keepin' in mind that there are absolutely no time to be taken time for granted. we must all get wild now so that we can be show that we are someone capable of being qualified enough to contribute to our honor, preparation for the final world front. all my motherfuckers, stay tuned, for the next FLIPMODE explosion until the next times set your shit and prepare for."
98,Outro - the Burial Song,1998,E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event): The Final World Front (1998),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"The Burial Song (repeated)
-From Heaven, Our Gracious King-?
Though some of us have been poisoned
Many of us have been blessed
And through the worst shit
That we all as people go through
Every blessing that we are blessed to have
Are blessings that provide us with what makes us capable of withstanding
And makes us more powerful when we go through the worst shit
Everything and every motherfucker gets dealt with accordingly
Mark my words
See I remember on the coming album
You know when there was only five years left
It was once said that there was no time
To take time for granted
Well we are now face to face with death (any given time?)
There's only one year left motherfuckers
1999
The dawn of the new millennium
I understand though
Sometimes it takes time
And hands on extreme hardship experience
To realize how much better it is to prepare for the worst
By all means
It will always be better to be safe than to be sorry
So as we finally approach the year 2000
Behold what it might have in store for us people
There have been many indications of changes
That will occur, that has already occurred
That were not and will not be setup to our benefit, as people
But in order for us to continue to build
We must destroy
And unfortunately in the process
Many of us will be liable candidates
Of being destroyed
But in the bigger scheme of things we must defend
What we all collective identify with as the truth
And with what is right
To all my live soldiers
And all my live women
Those who may not survive the turning point
May you forever rest peacefully
As you are delivered back to the essence
So I dedicate this burial song to all of you
To my survival of the most fit for real niggas
And women no doubt
Continue to get what's your from out this fucker
Before your time run out
And my the force of survival forever rest with y'all
My live motherfuckers
To all my survivalists
See you in the next thousand year period
Allah bless all y'all
Flipmode continue to bounce
Like a satellite in orbit
Seein' all you motherfuckers at every angle
The imperial, the universal, powerful Flipmode squad
Stay tuned

Make them shut down the club, we threw a brick in da door
(P. Diddy)
Shit, I'm the number man, hot like Summer Jam
[Busta] (Puff)
Slick like Fonzarelli, and Rich like Cunningham
I stretch them like rubber bands (I make them say)
Oh shit, the bitch got up and left with another man

There's nothin' to talk about (see), you just a walk about
I light a long L, and just blowin' the smoke about

Can imagine the price that my jewlery really would cost
We go to clubs with a briefcase and a half milli to floss (damn)
Fuck around and you can really get tossed
Ken Griffey flow, call me Alaska 'cause I be the king of the frost
What you can do is

Five thousand boomin watts

The game is us; we gettin' money motherfucker

Beat the street up, shit be sounding remarkable

Huge rechargeable batteries, bitch I'm tweaking, only
Short circuit electric chair bolteses every feature Coly

Defense mechanism from infections, the way that BUSS IS
Ain't no fucking around, I'm fronting, Get it?
As for getting this bread I'm like vomit so disgusting with it

Okay, Weezy F Baby man I gotta put the pressure on 'em
Young Money the special team, we so Devin Hester on 'em
Right up on your girls lips, got my dick resting on 'em
Soon as they woke up, it came and left it on 'em
Swag with no effort on em, quicker than a leopard on 'em
If he got beef watch me sprinkle salt and pepper on 'em
No Spinderella just plenty metal for any fellow
Semi settle everything for me and everything for me
Smoking on that G13 and everything funny
Specially y'all bitchass niggas, kiss-ass niggas
Blood gang 6 flags niggas, no rollercoaster
Real shit we hold the bread the hoes hold the toasters
Young Casanova, I bend their asses over
She say my dick stronger than a six pack of Cola

Stackin a crib with a chick that make a proper dinner
Black in the range with tint, and chrome aqua spinnin'
Parked right next to the Benz with a soap opera and the TV
Up in the dash co-starrin' a opera singer

Gun blunt you, and rep for every thug capital

Plant beatings on niggaz and celebrate a war chant
Diabolic how we manifest raw logic
Chronological time, we bring niggaz the raw project
Hold fort and represent as the grand wizard
Street chronicle illustrate the bakin of a bad blizzard
I got a spot for ya,
With live niggaz who murder sloppier
Than ALL of the Trenchcoat Mafia yo

Speedin like we racin on the Aqueduct
Black tinted-out, government truck
Curbside on niggaz, leanin just a little bit
Trunk trapped with smoke, my bitch'll take a little hit

In the wrong place you get your WIG peeled backwards
Get an ounce of the 'dro and STEAM a pack of Blackwoods

Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars
We 'bout to do it real big like outta this world and we takin' it far
Shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us
Now don't you think this shit's outrageous?
At this point if you don't see I'm one of the greatest
I play the long time up in the league with the majors
In every history book they add a couple more pages
Like about the way I take 'em through stages
On different levels, peep the way it read on the gauges
Regardless I'ma love 'em, I don't care how they hate us
No matter how they try, see they could never replace us
Like mommy always said beware of the dangers
Embrace genuine love, be careful of strangers
'Cause when you are the best they try to weaken and change us
They don't recognize at first but always do when you're famous
Like I live my life bold and courageous
And invest my time and always calculatin' my wages
And let me lead the march, they'll probably start to parade us
Because you know that I'm comin' to save us
As we go way beyond sky's the limit and you know who we are
We shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars
We 'bout to do it real big like outta this world and we takin' it far
Shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us
I spread my wings takin' off properly
I laugh at muh'fuckers that'll think they can top me
I laugh harder 'cause somebody said that they dropped me
When I'm flyin' through the sky, now how the hell they gon' stop me
Like most of the time it's good to be patient
Now I'm back with the crack, sorry for keepin' you waitin'
Prepare the food right for the street and season the steak
And grab a champagne glass and put it up, we celebratin'
Like and tell me who you tryin' to race with
If you ain't notice nigga I be ridin' a spaceship
I'm light years ahead and way beyond all the fake shit
I gotta stay away from trash because I probably'll break shit
Like I know it's kinda hard to believe this
The way I always come back and return with the heat, bitch
This shit ain't a secret, son, it's hard to defeat this
Risin' out the ashes, flyin' like a Phoenix
As we go way beyond sky's the limit and you know who we are
We shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars
We 'bout to do it real big like outta this world and we takin' it far
Shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us
See now you see I'm back in the zone, B
And it feels good to be home with Sylvia Rhone see
Back to smash on the planet, niggaz know I'm the only one
To be back with the authentic to smash all the phonies
Like we mostly do the thing that you can't teach
And then send 'em a rhyme into that bullshit you can't reach
Then I give you shit that make the hood wanna bang in the street
And state my word is bond, I live out what I speak nigga
As we go way beyond sky's the limit and you know who we are
We shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars
We 'bout to do it real big like outta this world and we takin' it far
Shootin' for the moon and land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us"

And leave 'em stiff when I hit 'em like a MUSTARD gas
Steam fire when I puff, then I flick the ash
You wack and I had enough, put your shit in the trash
Now you know we got the shit in the smash
Wild until you slip and you crash, y'know we keep the SHIT in the stash
From the GROUND when we come around, yes we put it down
And always BOOM AND POUND, when we shut 'em down

Beats brutalized your whole rhyme, your head hurtin'
Broom sticks and britches from rags to riches
Forget mad love

Amateur, why won't you look right at the calendar

So starting to just bust my rhyme calibre
Consecutive wounds like a nigga stabbin ya
Ya, my whole team get wild cream
Poloticin every move to the extreme
So hardcore like Quickdraw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before
Ha, yo I come right through the door
With rhymes galore Busta Rhymes be embassador
Explore my metaphor you beg for more
Hardcore serious surely insecure
I said my whole squad of niggas come through and break the law
My family tight more than connect four

Bend your mind with rhyme colicanises

Lost or found floor will blast like a four pound
Right before I hit you off with my vaccine
Starch, carbohydrates lots of protein
Vaccine baby girl yo I hope your ass clean
Magazine frontine fly lips is lime green

High beam the lights and watch will remain supreme, ha
Don't ya know when I keep it comin'
Blow the fort

Bounce on the beat and watch how a nigga work it
Buck wild makin' ya speaker short circuit
This heavyweight tip the scale on the triple beam
Busta Rhymes blast and still bang the main screen, blow
I had ta make ya all mad
Hit ya off, interlude
Bounce to Trinidad

Make a nigga cough, breakin and turn ya ass off
Extra raw
Lay on your back and on the floor
Busta Rhymes got to headline the whole ball
'Cause we so hardcore like Quickdraw McGraw

115,Sobb Story,2001,Total Devastation: The Best of Busta Rhymes (2001),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"Verse 1: Busta Rhymes
Remember the days when I was walking and talking
Doing what I gotta do, doing what we wanna do
Off into my walked dawn missions, why?
'Cause the brothers that I knew with the rise drove by
Only nice in the days looking down the road
Seeing beautiful girls with the car load
Yeah yeah yeah they are screaming,
Wish I had a little ride on my own,
But since I don't there is my sobb story
My missions will continue as I keep on stalking
Stamina was dying from the constant walking
Right before the moment I began to car to my man Ridle
Who had a some moving on
I tought he wouldn't know that's my dying
Where are the others nammy you beat and kept driven
Now in my heart they do a big hole
'Cause my little, little, little toes
Started jumping on my end soul
It was frigity burn and then I said wait, I got pride
It's time to get my own ride
I came up with the scheme and got paid
I had no other choice but go at knowledge of tray
When I got my transport, I got kind of steam G up
'Cause I got cherry pet further
Now I'm feeling good 'cause I'm off my feet,
Man the little squalid dogs running up in the street
And they saying:
My name is Sharina, my name is Busta
My name is Tonia, my name is Busta
My name is Dianna, my is Busta
And what do you take me for the little loco push over
No shame in my game 'cause that's how I got this
And when I return the playback everybody gets pist
And now I am the man fielding all the glory
And when you rise down and gone, just remember that
I know you and you know me,
I know you and you know me,
I know you and you know me,
It's the sobb story, the sobb story
Verse 2: Charlie Brown
Red like green like 1, 2, 3
Here comes the hop along kid Charlie B.
I'm constantly moving with my walkman kicking
My bunnions are crying beaving plicking
Please, please, get into the vehicle
I stop at Dave's ave.,
Figure out vehicle-brother, to give me a ride
""Sorry, Charlie"" was a coming reply
I didn't forget about the girl in the sidekick
The rubber don't system in the swallow kid
C drive by with the posse, ooh ah, ooh ah, ooh ah
Hey Charlie Brown, where you go?
Well I have to purchase to get
Smoke from the rubber word up to my neck
Girls wear goochie and their friends way fendy
Wall ally a walker to get fairly
Just a beep beep an occasional way
The table's turn, now she got play
Lunchtime Marty and Deon
Jonhy Guills, Diego Stroy, and Dacon
Sitting and waiting for about to biggy these
I stack by the Crackerjacks just through delieve
Stress it's a mess I decided to work
But it's hard to work when your boss is a jerk
I sweat floors and drive to get mine

Wreck top kickbox galooine Brown who's the clown

Now I remember Rod when he first got his sobb
Didn't have a job and his car was a mob more brothers
He never knew from jack and when his car win flact

And when his car was in the shop they wouldn't stop buy
They've say ""hi"" on the reply but back came Rob
To the same old game
""Hee-hee yo, what's up to y'all, wanna hang?""
""Yeah sure"" they said on the quick fast
""By the way anybody got money for gass?""
""Nah, not me""
""I don't, don't ask""

That's why I always step with a bop and walk with a strut
And I always rep for the block and we all for the bucks
And we always step in the spot and be all for the cut
Vallet block two parkin' spots all for the turck
Bounce to the world when I be tired and be gone for the month
And it's all for the slut flowin' like a force of the water
Keepin' it runin so were the niggaz be at
Well they seein me commin'
Summers people keep it clapin' women just give me they lovin'
They way the streets be fillin' the kid they really be buggin'
Like I'm there dearly beloved my soldiers really be thuggin'
Or how I really be slugging' the ball out the ball park
Keep them whilin' then ten minutes later then it's sawed off
Create a small spark then down to the levels to make the walls stark
Testin' the God I think he be needin' them all off
(Bridge: Busta Rhymes)
Listen
I keeps the hustle up in my vain
'Cause it's all in my blood
Fell my pain
Fell my love
Fellin' niggaz struggle till the other one
(Chorus - repeat 3X)
Getin' to struttin' like the G.O.D.
Listen
(Verse 3: Busta Rhymes)
I'm sayin' we comin' through when I'm blockin' the light
Niggas think they rockin' the crowd but ain't rockin' it right
Make the people shout to the sound and rock for the night
'Cause I stay in the struggle ready rock for the fight
I stay whipin' the truck and leanin' and rock what I like
And quadruple my money more than the block of the white
We sayin' we bout ?? stopin' your rooms
How I be rockin' the diamonds like I'm dropin them jewels"

Hey baby put your hand on my heart tell me if you ever felt a heartbeat like this

Boom boom boom boom is the sound that your hear
From my heartbeat hard like a bass drum
Zoom zoom zoom zoom as my blood starts to raise through
My vains all I wanna is to be close to you
I like you those boots you know just what to do
Girl let me see those tattoos I'm gonna ride with you
Rite here's the perfect place to for me to kiss and fuck you
I can't wait to taste your SUGAR
(Busta)
I want to taste your body
I want to taste your face
I want to taste your breast taste below your waste
That's some of my many wishes
Fresh out the bubble bath girl you taste so delicious
From when you leave and go to work and how you blow me kisses
The way you come back to the crib and cook and wash the dishes
It's kinda hard to fight it once the fire is ignited
You feel my heart beat baby you got me so excited
(Hook) once
I can't explain the feelin'
It's such an amazing thing
You like a prize position
A gift to any king or wings
Is only here to protect us
No matter what we go through
And how it might affect us
Tired of the lectures
A piece to tell me to chill
But they don't really understand what I'm tryin' to build
But I brush it off as nothing
Baby let me tell you something
Every single time I see you my adrenalin be rushin
(Hook) once
(Jelly Roll)
Your body is smoking like a Newport
Better yet I'm backwards
You like it in the back seat case baby girl your that hood
I never had it how you put it on me
The way you move is makin' me horny
Man I just wanna kiss you all over you body stretch you like palates
Baby let's get naughty do it how we do fuckin' all around the house
Started on the bed ended up on the couch
Damm I touch you and you touch me
We get closer and you hold me like your holdin'
On for dear life boldly
And we go out on the balcony
And let our bodies wrap up and we fuck
Until the sun come up housekeepin come and catch us
I don't care thou you takin' it I'm givin' it we breakin it
Everything up in the room like a tornado in the makin'
And I'm wildin and I'm racing baby let me take you down
And while you give it to me let me give it back girl listen to the sound as it goes

Once the bomb drops here's to aftermath
Scientist tried to disscet my way and formulate my craft
Worrying bout how I achieve things
The way I antilze shit and how I proceed things
My style is real like bear skin imported from the Pursuance
Follow my excoriation all the way till you feelin' the newer vibe version

Destroy who ever complicate the way how I eat

Being exposed to the many casualties of the streets,
He has now realized what must be done...
He must bring the ruckus to all you mothafuckas...
He must bring the ruckus to All you mothafuckas...
He must bring the ruckus to ALL you mothafuckas!
(Rampage the Last Boy Scout)
And now for the moment all you motha fucka's been waitin' for...
All my flipmode niggas rise and awake for
The most powerful event to occur... THE COMING!
Once again you now rockin' wit the best
Flipmode is the squad for the year of 1996.
UH! Rampage the Last Boy Scout is who I be
Here to take you on another ride of the
Flipmode explosion. Street to street, land to land
Coverin' all burial grounds in your area.
I'm here to bring on my physical,
The 8th wonder of the world,
Straight from the dungeon shot,
The infamous, the infamous, Busta Rhymes!
Boy Scout's who I be, Flipmode is still the squad...
(Busta Rhymes)
Yo, hey yo, yo, this joint right here, is dedicated to all the
Mu'fucka's who fell off... and the mu'fucka's whose about ta fall off!
Yo, keep falling, keep fallin', hey!
Keep falling, yo, keep fallin', keep fallin'.
This is specifically for the mothafuckas who came out here,
Claimin' to represent hip-hop but really didn't do shit
To preserve the value of the fuckin' artform,
The way of life. Hip-hop is a way to live man;
It ain't no institutionalized religion or somethin'
It's a way to live, it's a culture, dog, you know what I mean?
You know, so if you ain't really got nothin' beneficial
To offer this hip-hop shit, preserve the value of the artform,
The music, the way of living, don't even fuck wit it!
We don't need deadweight mothafuckas
This is where we at as it stands right now
In the current day of 1996, mothafuckas.
There's only four years left. This is dedicated to
All the niggas who keep falling, keep fallin', so keep fallin'!
Ah! Ha, so keep fallin'...thanks a lot."
129,The End of the World (Outro),1996,The Coming (1996),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"I would like to thank the whole entire world for absorbing such a special moment Busta Rhymes. I just want to keep y'all all posted, keep in mind, that we don't have too much time to take time for granted. We need to make the moves necessary to get it all, before they try to cut us off. Motherfuckers got to really realize that if we don't bring it now, we might never again find the precious opportunity like now to ever bring it again. So all my motherfuckers stay tuned.
""Damn if I just had a little bit more time, if I only knew what I know now, things would be better. Would it? Is it too late? Damn is it too late?"

(Chorus: Busta Rhymes)
You can live true baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose you got to leave your life
Aiyyo you're running out of time, and you bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line
(Verse One: Busta Rhymes)
And, yo! I can't afford to waste a second
Steppin with my eyes on niggaz checkin' on my weapons
Every millisecond, motherfuckers say they true to this
But when they grab the microphone they shit sound like stupidness
*Beatboxing* Hah, mad to pull another vicious scandal
I know that you can't handle when I flip from other angles now
Feel my hot wax, burning from my melting candles
You can't take the heat, so you switch from boots to wearing sandals
This is for example! Shit will make a nigga curse
When worse comes to worse, you be the first to disperse now
We don't BELIEVE your man was living like that
Hoping to find that nigga see exactly where his heart was at
It's a damn shame how Son know your style, know your name
Watch how he pull your file, make you wish you never fuckin' came NOW
Even the hardest motherfucker has his final day
So kill that shit you talkin', and be about your fuckin' way
(Verse Two: Busta Rhymes)
Yo, everyday I see you on the block smoking
With a bunch of niggaz scoping on how they can split you WIDE open
You don't even know what's going on up in your circle
Awful murder niggaz itch to leave you black blue and purple
Ah, your man came to put you on and tried to make you bleed
Hit you with some shit that left you flippin mad in disbelief
You just can't believe that niggaz that you smoke with is on it
And the way they rass they really got to bust yo' shit!
Thought your man was joking, paid no attention to the situation
Got with your crew and just continued smoking
Now your man sit and watch you panic
In any other situation you'd be fronting like you gigantic
I guess all that fronting is your main talent
It's apparent, he can see right through you like you transparent
Hah, aiyyo you need to watch your back you running out of time
Watch your step, 'cause you only inches from the finish line
(Verse Three: Busta Rhymes)
Now, there's about a million motherfuckers on your trail
Quick to bust your shit for every single time your words failed
I'm watchin all the moves you makin' fuck the speculatin
Super-bitch nigga you just be fakin if I'm not mistakin
Every move you fake you dig your grave a little deeper
Come around me with that shit I'ma flip it to my brother's keeper
Listen to this: overstress my emphasis
I insist to fix and bring the noise as long as I exist
Now you walk around the streets with all that shit you speak
And step inside the club just to receive the illest ass beating
HOO! Take a look around you get no type of sympathy
Impatiently, I sit and watch you die in your own iniquity
Hah, now you out dead and stinkin, and your eyes are no longer blinkin
Time caught up quick, with your little BITCH way of thinkin'
Ah, watch you diminish, while your niggaz have to put a finish
On your misleading false image
Word is bond, bond is life
You shall be willing to give your life
Before your words shall fail
All those who out there frontin, misleading they peoples
Actin' other than they really are
It will catch up to you player, word is bond
So that's, specifically, to all those fake motherfuckers
Living out here on that bullshit
Trying to act like they know what the fuck's going on"

It was the best heist since ice
Precise rituals
Skated outta Jacob's wit the Fruit Loop jewels
Holdin' a navy blue uzi
Krush Groovin waves off the atlas
Coolin, that's how we make movies
Basketball gun brawlers, bounce
Black down 'bill-a-head banks, Malibu colorful shanks
That's the way we live, Staten Island kid
Old dog in it, the thug vaccine wit no pork in it
Vivid imagination paper chasin
Dufflebag swollen, we holdin'
Drink chocolate milk before we roll in
It's like that y'all, we gangstas
Stickin all you Bay Ridge Benzes

Tiffany's, pretty Valentine brick is on the second floor balcony
Gems is magnificent, diamonds is cryin
""Busta Rhymes take me, nevermind help!""

Aiyyo caught 'em at the ice pavilion
Dressy, salad bar style Nestle
Four white niggas, covered in vest pieces
Think like a mob flick
Guessin like Patsy in the mask, piece bust
Got aggravated, slapped the glass piece
One nigga beamin, faggot ass
Lay on the floor ya fuck
Tied his broken arm to his Hush Puppies
Wrapped around trauma, everything realer than fuck
Tajuana left my nigga niece live comma
Three young Italians, suited down personal style
I'm in valour white designin on the 'dallions
Felt like some crackers was in back of me
Spit on the clerk, pass the Harry Winston set
Ghost backin me
Bust a shot, motored
Four male in paper work Lord
We get together once more before we blow this
Murdered nobody
Left 'em all baseball'd down, brotha
Three wicked ass 6's, Gucci colors
(Busta Rhymes)
MONEY! Drop dead on the floor
Nigga, pass the keys to the door
Pass me all the cash in the drawer
Or I promise you'll be payin' the price
Feelin' like a nigga died twice

Y'all niggas know we out to get this MONEY
C'mon MONEY! 7x

Let's get this money nigga

Somewhere in Africa
The Feds is after us, vest on my back
Whippin the Acuras, feel like a mac bustin'
A rug in Preston on percussion
I'll bust in your gate, nigga it's nothin'
A hail storm, ice rainin, mind containin
Info, nigga what you in for? Complainin
Sick bars deep in this language
Did I tell you how my day's spent?
Speakin' through the face of Ronald Regan
Iceberg History, calligraphy
Colidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flarin gunmen
Hate to see me comin' like gray skies on day of judgment
Makes you wonder where the love went
Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards
Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in
We duck in the safe, check what I'm huggin
Rocks the size of some shit, out in the congo
My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you
(Busta Rhymes)
Aiyyo we do great study on fossils and stones like archeologists
Gem-ologists, collect the most priceless ices anonymous
Canary stones yellow like a pumpkin
Dunkin Donut precious size stones make me wanna cut the safe open
Rae pass the blowtorch, Ghost brought the dynamite stick
Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick
Princess cuts, invisible settings
Plannin the world's greatest diamond heist playin' a tune by Otis Redding
Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites
Time to throw on a skully and tying a rag tight
Throwin' light went off and in the basket
Grabbed the necklace from off the satin pillow while the glass casket
Ice lay across the crushed burgandy velvet
Up in the diamond slide-tray
Gun in your face, slide it right away
Roundtable with Habib, Mirishnokof, and the rest of them Jewish niggas
We got them niggas drunk and talkin' foolish see
You know the way we straight manipulated the shit
We swindle them niggas for all their precious things before we skated and shit
Yeah, y'all niggas know we skated early
Disguised ourselves as the cidic Jews and even left my sideburns curly
Bounce to Mexico and spend some pesos
And bury the diamonds on an island your never heard
Like Turks in Keikos
Everytime we hit, we in and out quick
Don't be surprised if we behind supplyin niggas all the platinum and shit
MONEY! 17x
Yeah, the world's greatest jewel heist
Thoroughly and successfully executed

He robbed and stole and killed for greed and packed us on slave ships
(Busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
He took us off to stolen lands it seemed like hell for sure
(Busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
With the crack and the guns, death and disease they called for you and your
(Busta in background) happy Thanksgiving
No whips no brew no weed to smoke not a single luxury
If not for the bloodshed that it cost the struggle would be lost

The struggle would be lost
The struggle will be lost
If you continue to do the shit you be doin' with disloyalty nigga
Now that explains why in each ward you avoiding me nigga
Knowing now it takes nothing to be destroying a nigga
Conditioned with a mind to shit on your brother
Flossing with jewelry and whips just like a dick and still live with your mother
Copping shit that superceded your salary
Where is your loyalty to your own blood and taking care of your family
Funny how you sit and drink what you drink
Thinking the foulest shit and not even knowing why you think how you think
Must be the reason why we aren't aware
Because the devil know how guilty and filthy he is in all his affairs
Fucking with my mind when I was a youngster
'Cause he know if we knew the truth we'd make his ass run from amongst us
That's why we thinking that it's better to ball
While the devil be sitting and watching plotting how to murder us all
Now this
Hey yo
That's why I'm hustling harder
Now I'm in a huddle seeing the struggle in my mother and father
That's why my persona will come with such a karma to be getting this paper
'Cause I ain't with the slavery labor
A lot of niggas in the hood probly relate to me greater
Than those that believe when they die they going to meet the creator that's crazy
How we become slaves
To mental death and power that comes with becoming even more of a dumber ass
The devil robbing you blind
Concealing the truth from niggas while we be struggling they murder the mind
The wickedness sneak on you quicker when they creep from behind
Continue to speak the truth till it weaken your spine
Now check it
The jewel I give you be the beat the beat for the time
You can't see it like you living on a street for the blind
Young whitty hustler niggas that stick with the grind
Fly cuisine food poisoned cause you eatin' the swine
I stay struggling and doin' for delf
Then I dig in my body deeper and do a little knowledge of self
They wonder why they catch a nigga on the weed sell
Better be careful what you saying on them e-mails
Now listen
They got your mind in a prison
You can do whatever you want but focus if you desire to listen
As I say it I hope you feelin' the wrath
Create a hammer to make a man that a beat you in the head with the math
Now this"

136,There's Only One Year Left!!! (Intro),1998,E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event): The Final World Front (1998),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"""Daddy, what's it going to be like in the year 2000?""
Well, sweetheart, for your sake I hope it'll be all peaches and cream, but I'm afraid the endtime is near; the cataclysmic apacolypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind. It will be an era fraught with boundless greed and corruption, where global monatary systems disinigrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice. The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the oppressive weight of parasitic political conspiricies which remove all hope and optimism from their once faithful citizins.
Around the globe generations of polluters will be punished for their sins, unshielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted, left to bake in the searing naked rays of light. Wholesale assassinations serve to destabilize every remaining government, leaving the starving and wicked to fend for themselves. Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreak havoc. Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless and gutless system, where the rich get richer and the poor get fucked over and out, unleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust, annihilating the terrified masses, leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious cannibalistic mutated radiated horribly disfigured hoards of satanic killers, bent on revenge, but against whom? There are so few left alive. Starvation reigns supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything and anyone in their path.
Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow eggshell, causing unending volcanic eruptions. The creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape to certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison. Disease encircles the earth. Plagues of viruses with no known cause or cure laying waste to whatever draws breath.
And human kind, having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers, fall victim to merciless attack at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains.
This is Extinction Level Event, the Final World Front, and there is only. One. Year. Left.

(Mr. Porter)
I'm just playin' wit y'all niggaz, I'm just playin' wit y'all niggaz
I'm just playin' wit y'all niggaz, I'm just playin' wit y'all niggaz!
They told me to! [echoes]
(Chorus: Mr. Porter)
They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)
They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me
And alllll those people I call my friends, let it gooooooooo
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
'Cause you see how this monnneeey can change your friends' faaaiiittthhh
(Busta Rhymes)
Geah! See I done came a long way and now I got me a chauffeur
Keep my enemies close, keep my friends even closer
Muhfuckers that I grew around, thought I could rock wit 'em
Watch my cake so hard, they burn a hole in my pocket
I see 'em coming from afar because I been through so much shit
They plot a lot, hard or not, they see my dough come quick
Invested in my niggaz, took the realtor route
Gambled on the wrong niggaz, had to filter 'em out
Type of dudes that see my mother and they greet her respectful
Behind her back and see her son and try to give me a quick full
It's cool though, I fucks wit 'em even though I ain't wit it
That's why the gats be in the house whenever niggaz come visit
Serve 'em drinks and welcome all to the law
For let ya drunk friend to show his true side until ya forced to cut him off
I seen it one too many times, they disbelieved and they speechless
Sometimes having certain friends can end up being a weakness
See now my dogs turn to wolves and try to front me and surround me
Come up out they sheepskin and act all different around me
(Busta Rhymes)
Listen! Sometimes I smoke a cigarette and then I think and I choke on
How niggaz steal this funny style and I was struggling broke
Even though it don't surprise me, shit it's still kinda funny
When I ain't have, a nigga still would come and try to take from me
Instead of cutting my losses, being smart and just end shit
Niggaz was trying to be loyal, just to maintain a friendship
In the wrong situation, plus there's always a sequel
I'm with the wrong muhfuckers, plus they 'pose to be people's
As I get more money, days get colder
I learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder
So then I start the heart-on-my-heart as I walk like a soldier
Moving so militant, you think I had a chip on my shoulder
Living by morals and principles mainly
Having heavy thoughts to a kill a brother every time a fucker betrayed me
But now I'm winning with the strength of the nation
I promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit they'll be facing
I'm Aftermath now, shit's getting worse
Now when those same ""friends"" see me goin' hard that shit be making 'em hurt
(Busta Rhymes)
Instead they getting together with me so we both can get rich
When I'm outta town, these niggaz busy tryna fuck with my bitch
Same niggaz spend they money till the shit'll diminish
I hit 'em off and turn around and come right back when it finish
I said I'm tired of these niggaz, that'll owe me so much shit
That they can't pay me back for, fuck all the dumb shit
Sometime we can't forgive whatever balances off
'Specially when niggaz cross the line that niggaz never should cross
Realized and thus I state the same shit, get the Range
The more money niggaz get, shit around you will change
Even though niggaz'll flip and say, ""He the one changed""
Fuck you, the dude'll just'll justify... takin' his shit from you
The more money I get, I get more dangerous stupid
'Cause I been broke before, and I refuse to go back to it
And while I sweep these niggaz up under the rug with a broom
If I never see these ""friends"" again, that shit'll be too soon
Shit is real like every wind in my breath
And that's on everything I love, BLOOD OF MY BLOOD! FLESH OF MY FLESH!"

Niggas go out to get it,
Niggas is out there holding until I see niggas,
Niggas is out there holding,
Starving nigga, fuck that, I'm a broke nigga,
And I gotta see any nigga out here holding something,
Fuck that.
Everyday, me and my son stay scheming,
On how to maximise the level on day to day creaming,
While you remain faking,
Yo, I ain't tolerating, no mistaking,
We on the move to study paper-making,
Round up the whole squad quick,
Plot the scheme with my niggas, get on some full clip bullshit,
Before I solidify manslaughter, my unit form on the streetcorner,
We surprise like fiends in disguise,
Laying for the right shit so I can receive another grand prize,
Greeting niggas like a homeless nigga,
The way it happened son, you'd never figure,
How the homeless nigga gun is much bigger,
Now give me everything you walking with and everything your man is holding,
Even the watch that got the platinum moulding,
And as the situation start unfolding,
You scared to death you little bitch, go ahead,
Report it stolen, see what happen...
(Crazy fighting going on, mad punches, smashed glass etc.)
Cocks drwan nigga, holding my dick,
Wilding for the night, splurging with my click from the fit,
Open like a motherfucker, itching and ready to do the next stick,
Get any my nigga Dit can pick,
What you said I said even if it causing bloodshed,
Getting paid for even if we robbing a fucking chickenhead,
Word to mother son, I ain't fronting,
I'm taking everything I been always wanting,
So I continue to peep out, in the jam will be the most blidded,
Rob 'em in the corner bounce to the bar with they money and buy drinks with
It,
I stay on some real trife shit, test your life shit or even stab you on some
Knife shit,
Fake it if you wanna fake it, if I see it, then I want it, then I take it,
Leaving niggas ass naked,
Sometime I know it seems so shocking,
How you the next victim to be listening of the sounds of a trigger cocking,
All in your ears, cold steel all against your face,
I feel your blood chilling, your heart racing at a rapid pace,
And if you thinking that's strong,
I dare you even to flinch wrong, fuck around,
You feel the full five long,
The victim contemplating what to do,
Or how the fuck top get out of the situation that he's going through,
This nigga tried to grab the gat, you know I started clapping,
Bet y'all niggas wanna know how the rest of the story happened...

Yo, it's 3:25 in the morning
My baby mom still yawning
Kiss my little daughter on the forehead
'Nuf said, beeper goes off
Five hundred, it's Busta Bust
In God We Trust another one bites the dust
(Busta):
Hey Ramp, fuck that!
I was 'bout to see this cat
Some niggas pulled up in a black suburban jumped out the back
Tried to put it on me while we fighting over the gat
The way them niggas tried to play me son, them niggas is wack
Aeiyo, Ramp, yo, you know it's only right to react
Call the whole squad, let's lay these niggas down - face flat
Aeiyo, Bust, chill, calm down
I'll be there in twenty minutes
Uptown 1-51 at St. Nick
I'm there quick
I tell my baby mom I got's to go
I walked out the do' then grabbed the two nines out the flo'
Driving through South, yo, we takin' niggas war
Still on the run
Always running for cover when its necessary
I'm out numbered for now
But all that shit is temporary
Fuck with the wrong clik, the way we get down
If your violatin', leavin' you lost, you never be found
Number whatever on missing persons
Any minute them niggas gon' feel blast of my squads gats bursting
I through the tri-borough bridge
In my fat land with my two nines and my man's
I'ma second from the spot
I cross the street from the parking lot
My trigger finger is hot
I'm seeing Bust in a phone booth
Niggas on the roofs
Spiff Star is in the range
The atmosphere change
Lord's in the forerunner with machine guns, big ones
Now we 'bout to have mad fun
Me and the whole squad meet up,
Know shit about to heat up
Went the whole entire street up
Blast from the car seat-er
My enemies wouldn't even wanna be you
I see you, hunting me down
I knowing that my crew arrive
We gon' see who be the last alive
While we creep all over the place
Looking for space
In case, see him, rinse my whole clip up in his face
As my squad hold they post down
We patiently waiting for them to pass through
Carefully timing the way we put it on their whole crew
Aeiyo, Bust give me the queue
I'm here for you, close to you
Blood in and blood out
We goin' all out, bullets just ringing out
Guns is just spraying out
Yo Bust, hit the dirt layflat
You my nigga to the end I gotcha back
Turn around quick
Oh shit!
You started blasting, grazed me on the hip
Lord Have Mercy dumped five on a nigga
Suck his whole shit, his whole crew busting
Shit ain't going according to plan
Goddamn, my shit jam
Nigga standing right behind me
I think I'm caught up on a creep
I think I need to prayer to Lord, my soul to keep
Dis nigga about to fry my head
My crew burst into a rage
Spliff lifted this nigga, putting two inside his rib cage
Yo, Rampage
Aeiyo, I see them niggas coming, now I'm dumbing
We dead three niggas already the next two we leaving bloody
So much drama over this fucking money
The way this situation end it wasn't even funny
Trying to rob this nigga because I was fucking hungry
But if you try to test let's blast a nigga in a hurry
Me and my squad bounce and left the fucking scene ugly
(Anthony Hamilton and The Chosen Generation):
Things we be doin' for money
Livin' in the street when you're hungry
The way you start to live it ain't funny, no, no
Living day to day but don't live for tomorrow

Just make sure them, them drums is smackin
...
This, means, WAR!
I work hard to take care of every one of my niggaz
Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggaz
When I think meditate and contemplate for my soul
Watch the truth manifest once the story unfold
Disloyal motherfuckers I'ma BANISH you all
And celebrate all in your absence once I get rid of y'all
Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart
Break my silence and sporadically tear you apart
Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
Put you through the worst and make you take a look in my eye!
So you could witness the extreme damage caused by betrayal
Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed!
Make you eternally suffer, you was one of my mens
Turn your back on me, and I'ma make sure you get it back times ten
Stay TRUE -- now that's the one thing I religiously pledge
If you ain't wit me I'ma throw you WAY over the edge
This means war!
(Ozzy Osbourne)
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall
(Busta Rhymes)
As I cherish every blessing and I greet you with hugs
You my peoples when I see you I embrace you with love
Yeah I be the one to come and get you out of the hole
Yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
So amazing how many times you plot and you scheme
But what you don't realize, you'll never conquer my dream
Though devilish karma can't penetrate the steel in my armor
Time passed, my oppression got you living with drama!
Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear
Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, sheddin a tear
Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
And have to go to war with FAKE niggaz standin alone
Until I get with all my loyal niggaz goin' the length
Don't matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength!
Now I'm with all of my loyal niggaz, breakin the bread
And if you diss the code of honor we takin' your head;
This means war!
(Ozzy Osbourne)
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath

Cherish every breath you breathe

Nobody helps them
Now he has his revenge
(Busta Rhymes)
Whatchu gon' do? Whatchu gonna do?
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!
I'ma BE the best to show love let's co-operate
Disloyalty is somethin' that we won't tolerate
Deal with these niggaz, let's put them where they properly go
On the Island far away in a place where NOBODY know
So long fightin the bullshit for so many years
Watchin the danger and niggaz double crossin they peers
Yes I always fight for what is right and put my foot down
Disrespect my love, I'ma be LAYIN YOU DOWN
This means war!

Yeah, I got 'em yellin' ""Oh God, Lord""
Presence fresh, your neck rise, sharp Tom Ford
Fuck G4s, I charter private Concords
And she through the sky like missiles when they dodge ball
Toast them bottles with the booze
Smell and stink like old money buried in the king's tomb

When it comes to money I'm a nose fragrance, watch the flower blossom
When it comes to bread, y'all niggas know it's me
I articulate beautiful like a poetry
Hoes bring me that paper just like they all in 3's
Chip 'em a revenue, God bless my rosaries

Controllin' every room when I enter there start toastin'
Undecided on what to drive, think the garage is open

It seems successfully manifestin' a thought and livin' out the dream
Leave an unforgettable mark of mud

Ey yo yo yo yo
It was the first shine on the day of my birth I enterd the earth blind,
Funerabole to everything I would first find,
Condition of beating nigga's having the wurst mind,
Becoming weak like we scavangers of the wurst kind,
From having nothing to plot and makin' the earth mine, making the earth mine,
That's kinda big aspirations for a nigga that's just kinda got on his first grind,
But it's aight 'cause I'm blowing hold on my first shine,
Kinda gas quiker than spas ready to burst mine,
And thoug it seems like obstuckles come at the wurst time,
Going from being successful to committing the wurst crime,
So quike like a bitch massaging ya whole dick and bustin' up,
And it's over sabotagin ya own shit,
We always good when we get it and then abuse and regret it,
'Cause it's quike as we get it we fucking lose it,
That's what my mother used to tell me.
Seeing a flash that could take it from you like hocus-spocus,
So count your blessings and baby I hope you stay in focus,
Wide awake like I'm drinkin' cappucino mocus,
Takin' on more stress and get to be come and smoke us,
Hhhee, like the shit that the setup straight provoc us,
And fall riped them to the shit till it's lightfull and choke it,
A promise you find thruth when you done diggin it out,
Stop the shiffering nigga I think I'd just figured it out,
You see we thug visicily and mentally soft kep lies to yourself,
So that your worth and value is lost,
Sometime the feeling of the city is wrong,
Why we appriciet them all now tupac and biggie is gone,
Somehow I'm seeing it clear I would have rather this value,
Them so much as both of these nigga's is here yeah,
We always good when we get it and then abuse and regret it,
'Cause it's quike as we get it we fucking lose it, listen
Yo that's what my mother used to always tell me,
Extend your hand for the worry and blessing if they need you,
Never take life fore granted and bite the hand that feeds you,
Be causios how you treath people and how the people feel you,
Respect niggers or else the karmarus is coming to kill you,
You got it good baby just get your shit together,
Before you lose it and it's over and gone forever,
Dressed for the stormy weather feel the songs,
For everyone is personal like I was just writing myself a letter,
A lot of niggers is wildin and calling a name with disrespect,
Cashing and blighting and trowing salt in the game I'm saying,
I'm dealing with logic I hope you ain't thinking I'm rude,
Lets stop ruin the greatest thing that's been given us food,
Cloth and a shelter when its cold whe be staying warm,
Imagin if they just take the music and rap was gone,
We always good when we get it and then abuse it,
I won't let it cause presieus and I ain't ready to lose it, listen"

Fuck wit the kid 'cause I'm taking you into another zone
See it don't matter what you think or what you say
I always love for the street every single day
You better get down on your knees, you better pray
Cause goin' against the grain of this Squad
I promise you will pay! (WHOO!)
You see Flipmode is the team that I rep forever
Respecting the Code of Honor staying together
It's getting hot I think you should take off the sweater
Rattle and knock all of your troops who goin' to get this cheddar
See when we come I'm wondering how they gon' manage
Show 'em mysteriously watch how they vanish
See when we finish just analyze all the damage
No matter who you are, we accept any and EVERY challenge (yeah)
Yeah yeah, I think we got 'em again this time

The way I put it down you will remember the name
The way we change it up shit is never the same
And when I'm finished I promise I'll have you niggas feel ashamed
For giving the people shit they ain't really loving
It's funny to me but y'all niggas be buggin'
But it's aight because I will continue flooding the streets
With heat for the ladies and niggas who be thugging
And if you want it then bring shit wit open arms (spread love baby)
While I continuously give you niggas bombs
Asalam will make 'em will lake 'em so long
I'm in the absence of confusion holding the world in my palms
I'm tired of telling you there ain't nothing greater
Swinging the torch and repping for Violator
So tell the DJ to go and turn up the fader
Putting it down for the streets regardless what you saying playa!
How many times am I gunna have to tell y'all?

Now see, every time we step in a place
I give y'all niggas shit that put a foul look on your face
And rob ice like I was never more able
Don't drink coffee 'cause my diamond be cutting the glass on the table
Hey, I be the lost found tribe of ""Jabas""
Bust niggas then I plant another bomb in your ass
And then I put my students all in a class
To clear my ruler ship
And make y'all niggas fucked up doin' the math
One time now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Turn my music up (C'MON)
Turn my music up (UHH)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Truck volume (C'MON)
Truck volume (C'MON)
I know ya-wanna-get up-on it
Let me-show ya- how we do
Every-time we-drop that-shit you
Know we-put it-down for you (HEY, HEY)
How many times you gon' crush down somethin'
You need to change your name up, to Bus-A-Bus down somethin'
You fuckin' with the highest my nigga
Tryin' to fuck with the giants, might as well call me Goliath my nigga
C'mon, drop hot shit on the spot; sop it up with a mop
Before the hungry come and shop on your block
I know some niggas that'd love to blood suck you all
A thing of the past, because them niggas stuck you all
One shot bustin' the same bullet, struck you all
And when they bounce you hear voices screamin' ""FUCK YOU ALL""
Gathered up about a thousand young ?box? who brawl
As decoys, in case they needed to duck you all
That's why you better move tight with your click
Niggas be thirsty and quick
Just to be off into the night with your shit
C'MON, we keep it street to give a damn who you are
Make niggas wile, and bitches spread, and put they hands on the car
Now let me frisk 'em, and shake they asses down to the floor
One dude wonderin', ""What them niggas is poundin' me for?
What them niggas grillin'? What them niggas houndin' me for?""
Before the poundin', ""What them niggas was surroundin' me for?""
Well let me tell you what the fuck we was surroundin' you for
We came to get you once but now I come to get you for more
And while they get and got, niggas drinkin' ten-dollar-henne a shot
Getting' drunk and wilin' out in the spot
What the fuck now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Turn my music up (C'MON)
Turn my music up (UHH)
Hot shit now (C'MON)
Street shit now (C'MON)

Yo we gettin' papers spread love and happiness's
Shit blazin' so hot DJ's scratch the test presses
Like make it mo hot baby *chorus comes in*
Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby
(Repeat first three lines, finish with 'Turn it up')
Yo, word is bond
Baby let's get it on

Watch your ass swing
Hangin' like a medallion
Exercise baby let me see you spread on the floor

Hit the deck, on your mark, get set, we bout to jet
Spark it like ingelet, chickens breakin their neck
Yo we play to win
Such a shame, shit is a sin
So hot baby body heat bubble your skin
Everytime I flow speak
I caress the whole beach
Just like the body guard Les straight walkin' the street
We get down
Verse Three:
Yo, come on baby just feel my heat wave
A lot of hot ones ready for niggas who act brave
Chill son, you better off if you behave
Flip money while broke niggas tryin' to save
Lay low, I say so, my pesos
Import my cheese stack by the castros
Make clothes
Or stay fly a chase hoes
Equatorians soft lips and straight nose
Makin' dough
When we rippin the paid show
Get the money and dip, we in the Range Rove
Now we makin' grands
We name brand
We make plans, change plans
Then we expand across land
Do it properly
Yo, I said open sesame
The recipe, be the hot shit, it's got to be
Yo, landscape
We arrange a whole shape
Rock the fly tape
Then I continue to skyscrape
Like ah!
So hot"

Flipmode is the squad so it's no surprise
Niggas want to advertise about how we get down
You fuck around leave your body in the lost and found
How you like me now?
We got the industry on lock
The world is on shock
I'm a take a piece of the rock
Yo, you feel it in the heart when we took you to the park
Midnight after dark, I'm the raider of the lost ark (ark echo's)
Now na na na na na na, nana nah
Super size, super size, right before your eyes
I bring in treats like giant sweet potato pies
Wise, sword shift and I spit on flies
Killing all the tips from studio spies
Head to bed, beddie bye, beddie bye
Don't ask why, we'll take your ass to paradise
Flipmode's the squad don't rest, don't try
Peace to my people in the friendly sky
Peace to my outer space ties
I'm in leather like the ladies
Bigger than crack in the 80's (80's echo's)
Drive the buggy I Mercedes
Blow up like C-4
Got so much to live for
Can't play the game no more
Pick up the cain no more
Brothers ain't the same no more
Try to sweat me, what am I aiming for
Get yourself caught up
Faggot ass tore up
In the worst way, the only way you can stop me
Is cock your glock and shot me
Drop me, pop me, make sure you that you got me
Cause anytime I live I'm comin' back to find you poppy
What y'all niggas wanna do?
Yo we can take it outside
Y'all niggas want something?
Yo we can take it outside
What y'all niggas wanna do?
Yo we can take it outside
Y'all niggas want something?
Yo we can take it outside
Push up in the hot rod, alley cats a rah rah
All my flipmode in the backseats with chrome nods
Hear to bust mine
Nigga frat child let his brain fry
Pretty boy sliced up philly contact from his red eye
You failed to realize when you macks me you drop the plastic
Run up in your crib, now you heat me from the mattress
My crew expanded, QB is where we landed
Yellow strip you crossed it
Now I'm forcing you to drink this champotion
Show me were loaded
The desert eagle hear it cockin'
Lovin' my doggie
While we shinin' continue flossin
Steppin on toes I crush the whole shoe
Pronto like Cru till I'm Triumphant like Wu
The shit you talkin' crazy like niggas turnin' in their hand guns
I be burnin MC's like betty grandson
Smokin' grey poupon boy
Two lines, I chew rhymes and make niggas fall like they was futons
All day outsiders, this squad be flipmode
We get a dick rode a whole shitload
Verse Three:
We the official g-u-rilla to lead militias
Stack peelin, americana
Spit sentences like one of missy wanna's
Reminisce the promise
Bring drama like Nicaragua
Fatigues march, army leaders, they count crooked drug dollars
And sip fresh squeezed milk from the titties of llamas
Leave cities in carnage
Prettiest farmers that pour whisky at harvest and hold 16 guananas
Maintain, maintain, maintain
I pray like Gussalini Zion fists
Try on this, you can't see me like vagina lips
Smugglin diamond chips, bubblin anonymous
The dominant will resource and count script crews and world wars
(World wars echo's)
Yo, you better practice what you preach, I got 7 MC's
And 10 g's, I'll show each
Never interfere and shit, souvenirs for your ears and shit
Clear poetry like William Shakespeare and shit
Word is bond checkin' me out
Hey what you talkin' about
You lost and walkin' about
Niggas got beef they want to say and start talkin' it out
Hey, oh my god, y'all nigga be buggin me out
Wish they could lay me down and have the police start chalkin me out
Now I zoom in on you and my niggas start stalkin you out
Chuck down that bullshit that you be callin about

Like my brown Louis luggage, I'm in a brown suit
A rare Louis collection, pushin a brown Coupe
Paint job sick like a bitch leakin out brown douche

I turn savage and grow fangs when I'm on every beat
There's never been any problem! We harbor heavy heat
You niggaz know that he got 'em, so listen when he speak
Go 'head niggaz! Peep how I'm rollin' up my sleeves on 'em
Boa constrictor flow I'm 'bout to put the squeeze on 'em
My money speak a different language, Lebonese on 'em
And turn it up another two thousand degrees on 'em
GET 'EM! I dress bummy in Bugati, stupid
And drown cities when I give you that tsunami music
And watch my HOOD niggaz spaz, peep the way I do it

Like a crew of bitches pull up and dodge the ragos
And how we dazzle these bitches with how we change flows
We take your slot, how a bitch take half
And rock chains with pieces the size of spacecrafts
You know what I rep, that's Flipmode Squad!
Wildin like a thousand niggas up in the wreck yard
Callin all live niggas
Booyah!
Callin all live bitches
Ooh ooh!
Yes I hold a pound for y'all
Say what?
Busta Rhymes hold it down for y'all
Get money!
Callin all live niggas
Booyah!
Callin all live bitches
Ooh ooh!
Yes I hold a crown for y'all
Say what?
Flipmode put it down for y'all
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yo, the empire strikes back
Shit is official, street niggas fight back
The way we set it off even the bitches might black
Raunchy as fuck, even they like it like that
Busta Rhymes in this bitch you know I got another batch
More hotter shit nigga strike another match
Bang this shit in your truck, nigga open up the hatch
And hold on your jewels before your shit get snatched
Better lock your doors, slide across the latch
Before we figure out the next vic to catch
So much lyrics flowin to throw in a teacup
More crack for y'all we just reed up
Gutter like a piss test in a pee cup
Switch the bounce for the streets, had to change the speed up
Raw for the bitches who thick and beefed up
Strip a club, big titty bitches double D cup
We all up in the truck, what the fuck we treed up
Pure coke for niggas, get skeed up
Let me bang something hard on your head like Vince Carter
And charter jets for my niggas with automatic starters
Blow shit regular like the UniBomber
Surprise attack you niggas like fuckin' Pearl Harbor
Jailhouse raps, let it bang a little harder
While I rep for the fam, Busta Rhymes the godfather
So remarkable
Classic rugged nigga music
Big truck shit
20 inch rims on a UConn or something
A fuckin' Escalade, Navigator"

If two dollars gettin' made, we want in
If a stock is gettin' trade, we want in
A record gettin' played, we want in
A message to the game, that we want in
Whoaaaaaaoh, we want in
Whoaaaaaaoh, this is a fair warning
Whoaaaaaaoh, we want in
Whoaaaaaaoh, this is a fair warning
(Busta Rhymes)
Ha, hey ma! Look your child's grown
And I built somethin', Flipmode is touchin down stone
Look you shouldn't have no fear
And now we bringin' the streets back, look how it feel out here
Now y'all respect the hard work, but I don't care nigga
We all tryin' to eat you better learn how to share
You see the moral of the story and from how it begins
Is I'm extortin this whole shit - nigga I want in!
(Spliff Star)
Open up the blood clat door let me in
Before I let the barrel spin and fire off the pin
This is my block (block) this is my shop (shop)
Fuck a ex-cuse, give me mines off the top
What'chu waitin on? All my patience is gone
I ain't waitin on no man, I stick to the program
Keep the pockets bulky like the muscles on Conan, swollen
European cars I be rollin' - Spliff!
(Show Money)
Geah niggaz, this is your fair warning
I give one so woo to the gang and they on it (so woo)
Cause you know how I think, drugs and extortion
We tired of waitin nigga we want our portion
You know what we endorsin, more violence and more fortune
Watch how you play with them boys - use caution
It's {Money Roll} geah
And that whole motherfuckin Flipmode, don't cross them"
156,What Do You Do When You're Branded,2002,It Ain't Safe No More... (2002),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"(Chorus: Busta - singing)
Branded... scorned is the one who raaaan
What do you do when your branded? And you know you're a man.
Wherever you go, for the rest of your life
You must proooooove, you're a man
(Verse 1: Busta)
See now I'm back wit the force, read about the kid
From the front to the back of The Source
You see me back on the course
Scream on every beat until my voice get crackled and horse
Front seat niggas never sit in the back wit a boss
Fuck the fact that it cost, the pricetag of the porche
Will cost ya life, have ya motha feel an immaculate loss
*Breath* But of course, come and speak to the best
And watch me spit a jewel sharper to carve the meat of your flesh
You lookin' weak in the chest, you see the street is a test
Women on the stoop smokin' holdin' a seed to they breast
You see the street is a mess
Strugglin holdin' a couple pounds of weed then the rest
Now I proceed to the rest of my niggas Keepin' it fresh,
Though we must stay on the grind I supersceded the stress,
We always seem to finesse from the East to the West,
You Know we w-w-we keep the teflon from the street to the vest
Kill that nigga slow like how you get defeated in chess
Got you under pressure--hairline receaded effects
Hot air niggas I only feel the heat from your breath,
Rap niggas beef in they album probably needed the press
And as a man I never found the slightest need to impress
Another man because I'm proud and I believe that I'm blessed
But yo I always found the need to address these weaker niggas
That speak to the street always keepin' the people abreast
Now you've been branded...
(Verse 2: Busta)
Higher science and I'm changin the crime in,
Watch my son 'cause you'd be fuckin' wit the child of a Giant
I'm in a place stuck between bein lovin' and violent, (voice switch)
Becomin more of a threat when I move subtle and silent,
Then set it off to be the only one to quiet the riot
My destiny's the only thing between the sky and the pilot,
Relate, it's like bustin' a 3-8
Be late, I be takin' most of the brick leavin' a pile outta shape
I never quit watchin these niggas try to hide they mistake,
Takin' a shit watchin they body floatin by in the lake
Make it quick you weak niggas better try to escape,
And create the quickest way to reach the fire escape.
Snitch niggas always quick to go and lie on a tape,
But it's o-k 'cause Super Hero niggas die wit a cape,
It's so great to watch them finally break, stand aside from the fake
Street niggas gotta slide for the take
Bein broke and not bein able to buy me a steak
Stackin my paper so see now I can buy an estate,
So I rely on the love and I reply to the hate
So much pain in the struggle my whole body'll ache... come on...
From the gates, so awake that was the plan of my fate
Now I'm straight... got me my OWN knife and fork on my plate
Wanna scorch a debate, wait... do me a favor nigga jus REMEMBER
The date... 'cause you been..."

Go 'head and crash your whip in the fuckin' wall
It's cool, niggas... we gets busy
(Verse One)
Fo' sho', spit rogue, get mo' bout to kick in the door
Dick sore, split whores till they shit on the floor
Clique more sick from when you use to see us before
Shit, kill a nigga quick, niggas know my rapport
Keep workers on the strip that be ready for war
Brick I flip a little quicker if they shit in the store
Rip, maybe till they drop, and they shit in they drawers
Shit crazy when I pop, and I'm grippin the four
Thick bitches in the spot, watch 'em strip for the sport
Spit vicious for the block, yeah we swingin' a torch
Stick niggas for they shit, thank 'em for they support
Quick nigga, better quit snitchin down at the court
Check track a little slick and try to go on my Forbes
'Cause we stackin like we rich, and we holdin' the fort
This time, we had to bring it, guess what we brought
The hottest shit to bang from L.A. to the streets of New York
All my people, get drunk, get high - WHATTUP?
Get money, get rich, get fly - WHATTUP?
Get stupid, get busy, get live - WHATTUP?
Jump all in your whip, turn the key and drive - WHATTUP?
Make a mill' yeah we gon' make about five - WHATTUP?
We speak the truth and we ain't talkin' no jive - WHATTUP?
I'm speakin' to the streets and everybody's widdit - WHATTUP?
Once again you know we only come to get it - WHATTUP?
(Verse Two)
Ha, I stay wicked now I'm back on the strip
Like I went on a vacation and I'm back from my trip
Nuff radio rotation like I'm sailin a ship
Or when the team circle the block, busy trailin my clique
Truck packed fulla niggas with the strap and the whip
Get the gat out of the stash, put it back on my hip
Gat butt you in the face, split and fatten your lip
Blood hit the floor louder than the clap when it drip
I credit your name with bullets, read the back of the script
My victim's initials engraved on the back of the clip
Chicks love the way we roll, how the movement is thick
So official like my name's on the back of your bitch
Pay triple for the name on the back of the stitch
Name like the whole city now I'm changin the pitch
Kick back kinda crazy when I'm holdin' the fifth
Think you nicer than the God, shit is only a myth
Grab ahold of the masses, I was born with a gift
Niggas be runnin' they trap, throw 'em over the cliff
Thinkin' and drinkin' the Guinness, busy holdin' the spliff
Flippin and shittin on niggas till we old and we stiff
I don't even drive whips, throw the shit on the lift
12 hours, one worker do the whole of the shift
I do the thing to make you open your mouth
And give you shit to bang the Midwest and the rest of the South"

Testing your fate and wrecking your face
Invading your space
And watch the tables turn like you're trading a place
I pull stunts like evil kadeival
Me and my people fly like an eagle
And blow your entire cathingil
Hurry hurry
Don't worry worry
Hit y'all with a flurry flurry of jazz
Leaving y'all niggas blurry blurry
Brew up some shit like I'm cooking for y'all
When I'm done then I come looking for y'all
(Huh huh hold up hold up)
Federal cases cause nuff bodies end up in medical places
In they blood finding them chemical traces
Leaving special investigators going through skeptical phases
While we getting money the decimal changes
I was a seven-day affentice apprentice
Now I strike with a vengeance
Blowing the door right up off of the hinges
This be that put you out of your misery song
And make you ask your man is this the joint he dissing me on

Blast the challenger way out of space like Galica nigga
Battle star Galactica cross my diameter nigga
Derange your whole circular shape into triangular nigga
Yo
So what it was my fault
That I had to bring this shit to a screaming halt
What you need to do is open up the vault
That's why I make sure that my vest will be on
So when I blast you and your additional stress will be gone
Then I sprinkle just a little bit of salt on your plans
And watch your shit shrivel up right in the palm of my hands
I ain't afraid of ya
But I thank all of my niggas for saving ya
I was about to take you back
To when your mother was making ya
Clapping you up
Slapping you up
Trapping you up
Holding you hostage
Duck taping and Saran wrapping you up
Yo
First she was sober
I smell aroma
Put you in a Trans
And slip into an irreversible coma
Fuck y'all cubic zirconium niggas it's over
Closing in on all y'all niggas
While we're moving in a little closer
Then I evaluate and elaborate
Confiscate your shit and dare your ass to retaliate

165,Why We Die,2000,Anarchy (2000),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"(Feat. DMX and Jay-Z)
(DMX)
Uh, that's some shit...
...That that that niggaz ain't even seen before
That's that shit! (Motherfuckers ain't never seen
Nothing like this before, for real man)
It's goin' down baby, uh...
UHH! Busta Rhymes
WHAT?! Uh, DMX nigga
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I see ghosts clearly; even though, most don't hear me
They still wanna get near me - fear me, so I'm leery
Kinda eerie what I'm feelin' - from the floor, to the ceilin
Straight through the roof, want the truth?
I kinda miss robbin and stealin
Cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin when I starved
I was ugly, so I robbed, no one loved me, shit was hard
Went to God once in a while when it got a little too hectic
He was the only one I knew that I respected (WHY?)
Didn't know why, didn't know what I was livin' was a lie
If I ain't shit then, why should I try
See, plenty niggaz die, over dumb shit, up in the hood
Real good heart, but up to no good
Thought I did what I could, but I guess it, wasn't enough
The Devil told me it would happen but I kept callin his bluff
When it rains it pours now, my pains are yours
As yours are what's mine, define, revolvin doors (nigga!)
Chorus: Busta Rhymes
(Why?) All my niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
'Cause we crazy with it, quick to blaze you with it
From in my soul to every word that I curse
With all the agony expressed in this verse;
Let me ask my niggaz (why?)
My niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Because we Gods nigga (and) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet
And keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggaz (why?)
(Jay-Z)
They say the good die young, in the hood where I'm from
I only got one question to that - why the fuck am I here?
I look to the air, I ask God, ""Love me please,""
But in reality, only people that hug me is thieves
Same niggaz that send shots through my rugby sleeves
They wanna, slug me and leave, I'm thinkin' it must be me
Please shed light, the hood's dark
I did my dirt but got a good heart
Shouldn't that count for somethin'?
I was told I'd amount to nothin', most of my childhood
Liked by folks it was stuntin my growth
Seperated me from the shit I was wantin the most
Felt myself comin' close to pumpin them O's
Lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker
Tryin' to, erase my ghostes, chase the smokers
Got demons on both shoulders,
Tryin' to chauffeur my life through the streets
In other words nigga my will was weak
Please feel what I speak,
This ain't your average ordinary jargon
Weak rap niggaz be talkin'
This shit is deep, from the mind of Busta, 'X and me
To all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, till we meet niggaz
Chorus w/ minor variations
(Busta Rhymes)
I must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never
See you too could get it through your FUBU sweater
Like a nigga when he walk in the dark, trespassin
On a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park
I live and die for all the shit I believe
And rep for everything I stand for
With every single breath I breathe
Like the intake from cigarette smoke, it's like you inhale
The demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke
If the shit was all over tomorrow, I'd leave a treasure
For my kids with a legacy for my CHILDREN to follow
You know it's funny how the good die first
Get the peppin in your steppin faggot nigga
Cause you could die worse
Hold on, you know I cut off my arm, in the name of reppin
REAL NIGGAZ in the midst of droppin' this bomb
Allah blessin me to rep for the better, and carry on
Somethin' great and keep a nigga name livin' forever!

Yeah... wife in law, my bitch for the triflin whore
Type of bitch to make a nigga get the right things for
Bitch sexy, and beautiful, and gangsta, and golden
Love to fuck a nigga till the pussy dry and swollen
My lil' bitch had a figure like a wine glass
Slim bitch stackin like a muhfucker with a fine ass
Word to mother; bitch nasty like me
Love to fuck a nigga in places where people could see
The bitch send a chill like cold freezin a nigga
The way she holdin' and bitin and suckin and squeezin a nigga
Down and dirty bitch never dick teasin a nigga
Got her own paper and focused on pleasin a nigga
She ain't out for gettin' a nigga or fuckin' my life
She only wanna fuck a nigga while he fuckin' his wife
There was nuttin she couldn't achieve
In the mornin bitch was across the street waitin for wifey to leave
Called me on the cell while the wife was runnin' a bath
She can't wait for me to fuck her, till I cum in her ass
Just a long-time chick I used to fuck from the past
She love to out-fuck a nigga, see how long I could last
It be nice the way she always let me dig in her rib
The bitch fuck a nigga like she wanna move in my crib
Bitch I always knew ya ass was a star
In the daytime, whippin the droptop, givin' me head in my car
(Chorus - Jaheim)
When a woman needs love, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin' that you don't
'Cause she will fool around, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin' that she won't
(Busta Rhymes)
C'mere bitch and place ya pussy right where it belong
And put me in the mood to fuck just like a Jodeci song
I love the little freaky shit you be approachin me on
Dick all in ya mouth, you know what type of shit I be on
The way the pussy lock feel like we about to be stuck
All outside busy, givin' me the balcony fuck
Hold on get up off of me quick
Bitch grab the X.O. and suck the Hennessey up off of my dick
So quick, so fast, bitch'll come out her skirt
Fuck a nigga till it hurt, while the wifey at work
The bitch'll even call her girl so I can fuck with her friend
And fall asleep to wake up and start fuckin' again
Straigh nasty little bitch no horsin around
The bitch even want me to fuck her when she walkin' around
Hold up, it's kinda ill how we be workin the caper
She ain't only good for pussy, she be givin' me paper
Wife-in-law, my bitch be always keepin' it raw
Always slidin out before the wifey walk in the door
They way she fuck me on straight for the night
Wifey still ain't make it home, I wonder if she workin late for tonight
Wifey actin' funny style but I ain't fuckin' with that
She ain't call the crib so I wonder where wifey was at
Hmmm... shit kinda had me buggin before
But now I laugh because wifey had a husband-in-law
Heh... Heh..."

Break somethin', see the way we kickin in the door now
When I come see a Range and a Porsche now
Do what I say, women to the floor now
More is what I'm comin' to get
World tours now, nigga charter the jet
Got, women sweatin and they ready and they willin' I
Come to the telly and they steady doin' the diddy bop
Hit you with it, sh-sh-sh-sh-shorty gettin' really hot
Pretty with it, the way a bitch can make the city stop
Whyle all night, mami know the routine
Style so right and I'm creatin' a new scene
Bass seem to make mami come and put it on ya
While I give it to ya cause you know I'm back to DO IT for ya!
(Busta Rhymes)
And away we go off to the next spot
First 5 is a little club kinda hot
First on the scene, see the blunt fire spark
Snatch shorty, take her to the corner where it's dark
Now, shorty breathin all heavy, hands all on me
Then she turn around and try to put her ass on me
I ain't payin' no mind
Till I seen her crew waitin on the Soul Train line
Now, shorty workin hard tryin' to get with me
Wanna take me to the bathroom tryin' to give me quickie
But I ain't trickin on 'em like my name Tricky
When they smell my cologne they wanna try to give me hickie
Like kissin' and huggin and suckin on my wrist full of diamonds
Move slow, I'll tuck your little chick in my pocket
Type of shit I do all day
Like the last broad to the show stay, okay?"
171,You Ain't Fuckin' Wit Me,2001,Genesis (2001),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"Yeah... aiyyo Uncle Pat, turn up the beat just a lil' more for me bruh
Yeah... (imitating the beat)
This sound like Frankenstein's baby, yeah
(Verse One)
Busta Rhymes! You know we live and in color (color)
Shit butter hot, but just a little mo' gutter (gutter)
Smash shit regularly, word to my mother
Show love for the bitches and put it down for my brudda (brudda)
Hot butter funk make it rain, close the shutter - violate
Catch it from one of my bitches, boxcutter (cutter)
Ah, articulate! Feels so great
That I can bless my niggaz with shit they appreciate ('ciate)
No jive y'all niggaz can take a nosedive
Shit so live bitches wanna give me a high five (five)
UNGHHH! Fuck it, it is a must we hold grands
Get with the program and fuck bitches who love to hold (hands)
Foul shit, way out of order
Fuck shit up leave bitches hot and sweaty drippin buckets of water (water)
Disorderly conduct, will erupt
When the live shit come on niggaz do what they wanna (wanna)
Aight bitches, now show yo' asses
The shit we droppin' be sure to get y'all movin (get the fuck up)
We keep it poppin', feel how gangsta the loop is (we keep it boppin)
(We keep it gangsta muh'fucka)
And it ain't no stoppin' the way that we gon' do this
Now what you want me to say? Say you ain't fuckin' with me-ah
(What the fuck, c'mon)
(Verse Two)
Huh, you see I got so much new hot shit stored
Got you givin' me an award, floored a couple on the come up
Stretched a few, put 'em flat on they back
And laid 'em stiffer than a board, the way I make my niggaz applaud
My price tag, just to show up the shit
Might be somethin' you can't afford
Make you say the Lord is my shepherd, how we astonish
Move forward on novice niggaz like Cedric Ceballos with a hot song
Now niggaz know we rock on, cock-strong
All y'all niggaz is straight popcorn, Ah!
Talk the trash, comin' forth get past lie duke
Pass shorty with the big horse ass (ASS)
Now ain't no stoppin' how we comin' full blast
Mix the fire with gas, that's how we put it on smash (smash)
No lie, never deny - so hot we cook the shit well done
Just like a deep fish fry; UNNNGHH, snap crackle and pop
What we drop and how we keep shit comin'
How we maneuver so fly (fly), so high is where we gon' take it
Controllin the land, controllin the sea
Now we control the whole sky; perhaps make niggaz collapse
Make bitches shake they shit to the floor
And feel the soul up in my raps and your face is the gutter we slap
Make you crash all in your whip when you drive
I hope your seatbelt's strapped, aight niggaz! Now throw yo' hands up...
(Busta Rhymes)
Yeah, this sound like... the music to Frankenberry or some shit
The fuckin'... groovy ghoulies and friends or somethin' (laughing)"
172,You Can't Hold the Torch,2006,The Big Bang (2006),Hip Hop|Hardcore Hip Hop|Dancehall,Busta Rhymes,"Yeah
It's funny how the game change, right? Hehe
Shit feel all different
Y'all niggaz complainin' left and right about how the game feel all fucked up
Niggaz only been talkin' like that since we been sittin' out the game
I think the game need us Kamaal, let's talk to them niggaz
Huh!
So many nights were spent ponderin'
Wonderin' how we gon' come again
My golden rule is not to focus on the fame game
In retrospect, the game ain't the same mayne
They heart and soul is divided
They ramshack the music, no control up inside it
Now - look at this, it's all stretched out and nasty
But - lettin' money pass me
I doubt that, and niggaz from the bottom now
Pumpin' hard, wind sleet hail rain or snow
So... you got to get your gate right
No matter what, you got to treat your weight right
On the block if you focused on greed then
Nine out of ten times you be bleedin'
The analogy is clear
To all of my peers, I'm a muh'fuckin' vet
Don't mean to disrespect, cause
""I write rhymes, I write checks""
(It's clear) Bust, aiyyo what happened to the (love)
For the game (love) for the music (I need realness in my life)
Aiyyo these niggaz in the game don't sound the same
Bust, these niggaz in the game don't sound the same
Aiyyo what happened? {They ain't got in 'em to make a classic}
Aiyyo what happened? {These niggaz can't hold the torch, so why pass it}
Aiyyo, I ain't bringin' they names up
These niggaz sound trash, straight foulin' the game up
Need to change up (change up) sound so trash
When I see 'em feel like breakin' they frame up
DuPont registry, talkin' 'bout somebody else cars
Muh'fuckers better step up your bars
Instead of frontin' in the game like niggaz really are stars
Like we ain't seein' through the bullshit, we know who you are
I'm like a blessing to the game when your shit sound dated
I force niggaz to improve, you should be happy I made it
Here to rep the game fully, change my style like the weather
Givin' you niggaz new shit to make the game feel better
I'm sayin', I cook in the kitchen and we make the thoughts connect
You forced to humble yourself, give me my big respect
You hurtin' the game when your shit sound off y'know
A legend in this shit that's why I move like a boss y'know
You better be tight, cause you can get tossed fo' sho'
Y'all niggaz know whassup, I come correct with money long 'cause I
""I write rhymes, I write checks""
(It's clear) Tip, aiyyo what happened to the (love)
For the game (love) for the music (I need realness in my life)

Aiyyo what happened? {They ain't got in 'em to make a classic}
Aiyyo what happened? {These niggaz can't hold the torch, so why pass it}
Oh my God, they a (uh) come ridin' around
Some (uh) old dream and they (uh) can't get down
They (uh) lookin' around outside of themselves
And they {HUH} sayin' things that ain't really themselves
And they {hah} keep fuckin' regurgitatin' the same script
Same hoes, same blow, same glock clip {ha}
Same drug strip, what the fuck is this? (uh)
C'mon y'all, raise the bar on this body, shit
You sound stagnant, need to progress and grow (uh-huh)
Upgrade your punchlines, progress the flow (uh-huh)
Get your concepts and lyrics together, aiyyo (uh-huh)
Then drop the bomb shit to step up the pressure, y'know? (huh!)
I'm tired of niggaz complainin' how the game changed
You niggaz should step up your game, cause you sound strange
That's why you ain't sellin' no records, check the SoundScain
In this rap shit I command respect muh'fucker 'cause I
""I write rhymes, I write checks""
(It's clear) Tip, aiyyo what happened to the (love)
