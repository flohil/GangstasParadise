0,All Night Long,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"I'm back! The god remains, still at the end 
They sabotage the game, still I'm a win 
Rakim Allah's the name, and with a pen 
No one can dodge the rain, kill'em again 
In a club or the streets I swerve, cool in the cut 
Looking to see what occurs, crusin' the truck 
Shorty got deadly curves, soothin' her up 
If I must explain with words, I smooth as a fuck! 
The world's most greatest hip-hop's elite 
You obsolete, you cannot compete, drop the beat 
Keep ya ear to the ground when I rock the street 
Cock the heat, we deep papi got to eat 
So cut on the mic and spit, I much rougher 
Plenty of ice and a whip, plus a crusher 
Because I don't like to stick, or bust a brother 
Long as they never forget I'm a ill muther fucker 
So if you love to get your party on 
And you feel that your game is strong 
And you get mad when the broads is gone 
You like it all-night-long 
And when they love it when the place is warm 
And they go out for their favorite song 
They hate when the player game is wrong 
They like it all-night-long 
My caliber's out rated 
Yeah player, so why hate it 
My rhyme through out of control, when I say it 
Spit back with a rap or gat, can I spray it 
How can I say it? I leave it de-hydrated 
I take aim, and he keep the place flamin' 
Till the place cave in, aye yo this ain't a safe haven 
The best is yet to come, so they stay in 
They keep the music loud, the lights is low 
The kid with a different style, I like to flow 
It's time to move the crowd, tonight's the show 
See what it's all about, they like to go 
Get henny and mo and cris, the clothes, the platinum, gold, the wrist 
Plenty of doe, and chicks who pose for flicks 
Women who love roll their hips, when I'm holding this 
My mic's a equipped with a microchip, with a million Megs 
Bite this I might flip, spread a billion plagues 
Put medicine in it before I kill ya dead 
You can get away, if you can fill your legs 
Could you walk? No, at least you thought though 
Auto fours blow a hole in your torso 
Damage his brain with more flow until he talk slow 
Try to say something now? I thought so! 
I leave emcee's bleeding, while I'm fleeing across sea-in 
Start breeding, double my Swiss cheese in Sweden 
Free on the weekend, come back see if he breathing 
They breathing, somebody left his brains beat in 
A deadly attack is rare, style will be raw 
Be ready to rap you'll hear, as wild as before 
If I bust a gat in the air, watch the galaxy fall 
And the world will be splat on the floor, that'll be all"
1,Dedicated,2009,The Seventh Seal (2009),,Rakim,"You and me (You and me)
We used to be together (Used to be)
Everyday together (Everyday)
Always (Always)
You was dead from the beginning, all I had to do was survive
In a race against millions where they lose they die
?
?
At the end of the race waiting so I used your guide
I found heaven in you, You shared your light with me
Gave me insight way before the light hit me
It's more than just a bone 'cause we inseparable
Even when they cut the cord on the ambilocal
Never martyred a moment away
And fix whatever was wrong and always know what to say
The same way to my sisters and brothers
Always honest, and showed me what unconditional love is
The voice of a goddess, the stars twinkle in your eyes
My heaven on Earth or angel in disguise
If you was here I'd just hug and kiss you
'Cause to me words can't explain how much I miss you
You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always
I watched the ladies shine, and stay on their grind
While the world weighed heavy on the lady's mind
It was a crazy time
It's like the world stopped fast with pap's pass in '89
The harder we cry, the harder you cry too
?
It's hard to keep going, the harder you try to
?
You tried to be strong and keep the fam together
?
While you smile with your open arms
?
You said it takes some time, take it slow, but time will take it's toll
And the stakes is high, till the day you die
But I refuse to accept eventually that I would have to say goodbye
You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end
I'm starting to see how short life is
Every second it gets shorter, but your heart get warmer
And you get stronger
Even when they said you need a transplant and dialysis to live longer
?
You still managed to live life to the fullest for years
And then things got complicated
They found a donor so they operated
A gift and a curse, and concern that things took a turn for the worse
And even if I seen the signs I doubt the actions
Nothing had prepared me for what was 'bout to happen
The hospital; the 18th floor, vivid
July 18th, 2005 I can't forget it
It's that day I'll forever know
The end; the day I hope will never come
You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Always
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end"
2,Documentary Of A Gangsta,2009,The Seventh Seal (2009),,Rakim,"(Rakim)
Ay, yo this right here man, it's like the documentary of a gangsta man, the rise and fall
(IQ)
How them boys gon' play me? They must be crazy, baby, oh you better pay me
(Rakim)
I ain't playin' wit y'all
(IQ)
How them actors gon' act up, like I ain't got back up, back up 'for you get smacked up
(Rakim)
Where my paper man?
(IQ)
Why they wanna play games with me? But they don't know that I'm crazy
(Rakim)
Don't make me kill someone.
(IQ)
I don't know what they thinking, they must've been drinkin'.
(Rakim)
But what?
(IQ)
I'm that king pin
(Rakim)
He said slow papers, you're out oh.
It's like spittin', heresy is all about flow
Like he can't eat his cake and he starve when the count low
He call the lab the bakery, he all about dough
Stuffin' bread, his pockets is hungry
You talkin' nonsense, unless the topic is money
He call a hundred dollars a hunny, mommy's he call 'em dimes
So his mind's on his money, but mommy's is on his mind
Like a o.g. focused on the come-up,
Think he f-in around? He approachin' with the gun-up (bam)
Roll a blunt up and forget it happened
Stash the dollars, bag the product and get it crackin'
He get pies, he flippin' 'em tricks, he trickin' 'em
He call 'em heifers, he hugh heffin' 'em, he pimpin' 'em (where my money)
Fonzie, getting them ones for the connect
So have them ones correct when he come and collect (here he come)
Hook (IQ)
(Rakim)
That sound like blood money
And I ain't just talking double dubs and club money
I'm talking drug money, move out the hood money
Double up money, you could catch a slug money
This kid'll murder you, more than the business
If you livin' for revenue its principal never personal
Get rid of you if you blockin' the bigger picture
He on the block thinkin' a gwop is gettin' richer (get them ones)
He flipped some urban blue, played with them keys
For them c-notes, so he can handle the whole piano
Hammers unloadin' ammo, if his army ain't in harmony
He kill his own fam-o, like tony soprano
He's tryin' to take it from minor to major and grind for the caper
His mind is made up, he'll die for the paper
Crime is second nature when you love cash
Do 'em dirty, he turned the ave into a blood bath (here he come)
Hook (IQ)
(Rakim)
The heater bustin' mean the reaper comin'
Drug money keep him buggin' out the trees he puffin'
Streets is buzzin' 'bout the repercussion
But he so much in love with his bread, the beef is nothin' (ain't nothin' man)
He got medals for war, just like a veteran
But now he bringin' cheddar in, more than he ever been,
Banked up, he stepped his hustle - pimp, smoke, coke, crack
Heroin game up, American gangsta (uh huh)
Sleep with the fish while he ran the loot and
You like ballin? He like stealin' and shootin'
Comrades, customers, competition connect (don't matter)
Some hustlers is wishin' and plottin' the day of his death (bring it on man)
What's his focus? Keys is.
Even with karma catchin' up, it's hard to set him up, he always holdin' heaters (whoa)
But yo, they know his weakness, so they gave that bread to him
Somebody put a gun to his head, guess what he said to 'em?

3,Don't' Sweat the Technique,2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"Don't sweat the Technique (2x)
Let's trace the hints and check the file
Let see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul.
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass, till MC's get weak.
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep...
'Cause when I speak, they freak
To sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
Wit a melody and a president's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits
Wit' beats, parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique
Don't Sweat the Technique
They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped in rep., but
Researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to last who observe them
They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens, are swords
Letters put together form a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, born with structure
Because of my culture, I'm a rip and destruct the
Difficult styles that'll be for the technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique
But don't sweat the technique
I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep and the weak then complete their
Pull with a seat, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new 'cause it's radiant
And the wild style'll have much more volume
Classical too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant: mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
They fought, and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique (2x)"
4,Eric B Is President,2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnatize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line,
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
My rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note
My mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
Self-esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build
But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So Eric B, make 'em clap to this
I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric B easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
'Cause to me, MC means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist
Saying indeed that I precede 'cause my man made a mix
If he bleed he won't need no band-aid to fix
If they can get some around until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it because it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side, it needs erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style of the same old rhyme
Because I'm better then the rest of them
Eric B is on the cut and my name is Rakim
Go get a girl and get soft and warm,
Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand 'cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
I must of got you too hot and burned off your wings
You caught an attitude, you need food to eat up
I'm scheming like I'm dreaming on a couch wit my feet up
You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy
Thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze me
Funky..."
5,Finest Ones,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"Where the ladies at?
Clarkworld baby
Uh, uh
(4x)
It's the R baby
It's the god baby
(1st verse)
I got rhymes I love to bust looking for a club to rush
It's like thugs will rush the illustrious
We all love to touch the voluptuous
It's a must that we lust, plus we love to crush
Women pose, from timberland's to feminine clothes
Check there portfolios and put'em in centerfolds
Pen explode, draw crowds respond re-el
I stay calm as hell surrounded by bombshells
Careful as I get near'em, stand near and compare'em
Or all girl heirem, I'm the man with the serum
Assets, probably dressed but still bear'em
It seem like they wear'em, just for me to tear'em
In quakes I see more things shake then spring break
It's like a dream state, perfect shape same date
You got a lot to give and look how hot it is, you so provocative
And it's your prerogative. Baby bounce.
Ladies, nothing but the finest ones
The lavishist ones, the ain't hard to findest ones
From the boldest to the shy-ist ones
Which city got the livest ones
New York, L.A., Atlanta, V.A., Miami, D.C., tell me!
(2nd verse)
Bon Jour, baby here go my brochure
Give me a phone call, I'll show you the whole store
It's so raw, I'll have your world in all
You wanna know how much the whole package go for?
My spectactale, like a festival, it's majestical, special guest for you
Ready to party hard the party's in yards to the mardygraud
Rap say on's, please give you a body massage
Rock jams, have you hot in your pants and nasty
Forbidden dance with me? Or tickle your there see
Let Ra take you on a ron day vue
Couple of days will do if it's o.k. with you
Deserted isle style middle of winter with no bed
I'll comfort you like you were Jennifer Lopez
You get what you deserve if I said we swerve
I'll hit more than nerve and that's my every word. Baby bounce.
Ladies, nothing but the finest ones
The lavishist ones, the ain't hard to findest ones
From the boldest to the shy-ist ones

The lavishist ones, the ain't hard to findest ones

Baby you wake up the next day laungary negligee
Give you a sex ex-ray before we catch the rays
Let's blaze a lot more games left to play
While you still amazed from yesterday's escapades
Steadily show my pedigree so thoroughly to the b-o-n-e like chemotherapy
Sex and triple x you ready to wed next, relax baby you need plenty of bed rest
You've been a passenger of a high speed crash with a wild style fashioner
Dark skinned ambassador, chiropractor with a passion
For smashin' your ass like a cardiovascular massacre.
You've be through shock heading at your cu-wop
Body'so hot, you need a shot from your new doc.
With better cures where's it sore I'll wetter more.
And let it pour from her to head to her peticular's, baby bounce.

The lavishist ones, the ain't hard to findest ones
From the boldest to the shy-ist ones

6,Flow Forever,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"(Rakim)
Aiyyo... what's goin' on?
The Mic Lebanon Teflon Don...
I'm back baby
The year of the 9's
And I'ma have to make these motherfuckers a offer they can't refuse
Y'know?
Ha, what's goin' on? Yo c'mon, you know it's on
I wrote a song, test my flow on the Autobahn
Make sure the force is right, I floss all night
Get off the mic it'll smoke like an exhaust pipe
Keep 'em in the lie-bury, studyin my theory
Ra theory get translated in Swahili
From the lands as far as Zanzibar
They understand the R, the man Allah
It's obvious why the copiers, they copy this
Soon as my data processes Y2K they floppy disk
Now who the hottest is? How can it not be this?
Baby who the cockiest? Papi is? Gracias
Aiyyo, this be so, magnifico
Even my, typical, style difficult
Make a crowd go wild when I rip a show
Better stand back, this'll blow, you didn't know?
Chorus: Rakim
They show me love when I'm come through
Yo any club that I come to
I hit a microphone check one two
And they know what I wanna do - flow forever
(Rakim)
You ever witness rapport like this before?
It's cause y'all kiss the floor, say this my Lord
It's the chosen one, with the golden tongue
Flow for the old and young when I'm holdin' one
In the front row sitty, we show no pity
Where kids get jiggy and girls are so pretty
The Wanderer, back from Casablanca
To stomp all, what next for Ra the Conqueror
So let's go, the best show will explode
No dress codes, they just pose in they best clothes
Girls get exposed when I show my rap expo
Will there be a next episode? I guess so
Those that halved out, wanted to have clout
What they mad about? Must be a cash route
MC's switch they style from they last bout
And I bet soon as they hear this they spaz out
(Rakim)
Wherever Rakim go, it's the God temple
It's simple, my M.O., no problemo
Been all over the map, even know where Hell is at
I did the welcome mat, and then welcome back
My flow is raw, they treat me like Mr. Know-it-All
They want me to show 'em all my brand new protocol
Excuse-a-moi, I make a move for Ra
You ain't soupin Ra, save the hoop-a-la
Let me find out you rhymed out designed out
Pullin dimes out then climb out, for time out
I'm at the free throw, playin' ball, or cee-lo, I keep dough
Reloaded like Carlito, incognito
I be so, low key, women get nosy
I do a show they wanna go see to get to know me
In the front row seat they cosy
Thinkin' I'm givin' them the bo-bo-bee until they O.D."
7,Follow the Leader,2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"Verse One:
Follow me into a solo get in the flow
And you can picture like a photo
Music mixed mellow maintains to make
Melodies for MC's motivates the breaks
I'm everlastin, I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as X-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard,
FLIP IT - now it's a daily word
I can get iller than 'Nam, a killin' bomb
But no alarm - Rakim will remain calm
Self-esteem make me super superb and supreme
But for a microphone still I fiend
This was a tape I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I want to see who can keep followin and swallowin
Takin' the making, bitin it and borrowin
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
But I'ma let ya sweat - you still ain't warm
You a step away from frozen, stiff as if ya posin
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me and were ya thinkin' you were first?
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the Universe
What could ya say as the Earth gets further and further away
Planets are small as balls of clay
Astray into the Milky Way - world's outasight
Far as the eye can see - not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As ya stare in the darkness, ya knowledge is took!
So keep starin' soon ya suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the R
This is a lesson if ya guessin and if ya borrowin
Hurry hurry step right up and keep followin
The Leader
Verse Two:
This is a lifetime mission, vision of prison
Aight listen
In this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist
Am I Eternal? Or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep ya movin cause the crowd said so
Dance - cuts rip ya pants
Eric B on the blades, bleedin to death - call the ambulance
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone murderin' MC's
Let's quote a rhyme from a record I wrote
(Follow the leader) Yeah - dope
Cause every time I stop it seems ya stuck
Soon as ya try to step off ya self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showin and provin and lettin knowledge be born
Then after that I'll live forever - you disagree?
You say never? Then follow me!
From century to century you'll remember me
In history - not a mystery or a memory
God by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave,
But remember - You're not a slave
'Cause we was put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see it because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, reveal my name
I guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted; it can't be changed or switched
Here's a lesson if ya guessing and borrowing
Hurry hurry, step right up and keep following
The leader
Verse Three:
A furified freestyle, lyrics of fury
My third eye makes me shine like jewelry
You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every traitor or snake - so stay awake
And follow and follow, because the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim the Fiend of a Microphone
I'm not HIM, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt, 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed slow down to let the leader lead
Word to daddy, indeed!
The R's a rollin' stone, so I'm rollin'
Directions is told, then the rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin', a brother said, dig em, I never dug 'em
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug 'em
Into danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, it's basic, erase it, change ya tone
There's one R in the alphabet
It's a one-letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state, followers tailgate
Keep comin' but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant - clap ya hands, you won a trip!
The price is right - don't make a deal too soon
How many notes could you name this tune?
Follow the Leader is the title, theme, task
Now ya know, you don't have to ask
Rap is Rhythm And Poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might catch up if you follow the records E. wrecks
Until then keep eatin and swallowin
You better take a deep breath and keep followin
The leader."
8,Guess Who's Back,1997,18th Letter (1997),,Rakim,"Once again back it's the incredible""
Yeah, yeah
It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashin hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make 'em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up, and play it loud
Hip-Hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dancefloors just stop, the spot's scorchin hot
Hoping I open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar smokin' ten dollar cigars
While I admire ?, with more vision than TV's
I find it easy catchin diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slammin' track
Rockin' jams by popular demand, I'm back
I control the crowd, you know I hold it down
When it drop you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world renowned
And I rock New York City all year around
Check it out
It's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs
Equations are drawn up in paisley form
Mic it stay warm, my flow is Evian
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra style
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open fill it with somethin' potent to go in
And take a toke then, mental planes start floatin
Hot science is smokin' altitudes cause chokin
Product is hypnotic you're soakin and still smokin'
Showin better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumpin
I'ma move crowds to 2000
Yo, my rhymes and lyrics, find spirits like a seance
Since fat Cray-ons, I write and display chaos
My plan is ?, the diagram know where the damage
I take advantage, until your crowd go bananas
What a rush I hear cuts and I lust to touch
Microphones get clutches by the illustrious
Word spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge and scholarships, when Ra be droppin' this
Some of the things I know, will be in your next Bible
When I die go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt manifest was write rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic
""Once again, back it's the incredible""
Word up, Rakim Allah the Microphone Fiend is back, ya know what I mean?
""Rakim Allah""
Till death do us part
""Once again, back it's the incredible""
It's on
""Rakim Allah""

It's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs
Equations are drawn up in paisley form
Mic it stay warm, my flow is Evian
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra style
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open fill it with somethin' potent to go in
And take a toke then, mental planes start floatin
Hot science is smokin' altitudes cause chokin
Product is hypnotic you're soakin and still smokin'
Showin better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumpin
I'ma move crowds to 2000
Yo, my rhymes and lyrics, find spirits like a seance
Since fat Cray-ons, I write and display chaos
My plan is ?, the diagram know where the damage
I take advantage, until your crowd go bananas
What a rush I hear cuts and I lust to touch
Microphones get clutches by the illustrious
Word spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge and scholarships, when Ra be droppin' this
Some of the things I know, will be in your next Bible
When I die go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt manifest was write rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic
""Once again, back it's the incredible""
Word up, Rakim Allah the Microphone Fiend is back, ya know what I mean?

10,Guess Who's Back (Alternative Mix),1997,18th Letter (1997),,Rakim,"Once again back it's the incredible""
Yeah, yeah
It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashin hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make 'em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up, and play it loud
Hip-Hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dancefloors just stop, the spot's scorchin hot
Hoping I open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar smokin' ten dollar cigars
While I admire ?, with more vision than TV's
I find it easy catchin diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slammin' track
Rockin' jams by popular demand, I'm back
I control the crowd, you know I hold it down
When it drop you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world renowned
And I rock New York City all year around

11,Holy Are U,2009,The Seventh Seal (2009),,Rakim,"Holy are you
Holy are you
There is no God but you (ah huh)
There is no God but you
(I need to talk to y'all for a minute)
Praised be the Lord
(And be serious for a minute)
Holy are you (here it is)
Holy are you
There is no God but you
There is no God but you (Rakim Allah)
There is no God (G-O-D, the God MC)
Praised be the Lord (Yeah)
For those who find it hard to believe, and it is
Why they call me the God MC, the lyricist
Trace this style to the roots from Genesis
The world wonder, of still standing like pyramids
Design so vivid, every brick it got a story to tell
My rhyme flow different like a hieroglyphic
Mind prolific, infinite, like mathematic
The first language, now add that, and add graphics (Go 'head)
Then go let the blocks know it's the gospel
Lifes new manual, so watch close
The new Michaelangelo or Pablo Picasso
Prepared to show you the cosmos and rhyme flows
Even my lyrical metaphysical
What this will do is help you get to your spiritual pinnacle
You find your mind too far-fetched for it to fathom
I bring the darkness to the light, split the atom
It's like watching the big bang theory emerge
I take titles, bond them to reveal new words
They want a clear view
From the farthest and the darkest corners in the universe
To a corner near you
A pharaoh in ghetto apparel, stay blinged up
Fort Knox display, a modern day King Tut
Wrapped tight, rap like I've been preserved in time
Spit the holy water, then touch it and turn it to wine
It's the God
Holy are you
Holy are you
There is no God but you (I, I am the Alpha and Omega)
There is no God but you (you are not what you heard)
Praised be the Lord (you don't even know what you once were)
We were children of the most high, so we fell
From paradise to holy hell
Probably descendants of the Holy Grail
Another part of history they won't reveal
Times'll only tell
You waiting for Judgment? It came
In the form of a thug in the game
To create a strong position, there's blood in my vein
The chemical is identical, we one and the same
With seven letters in all three of my government names
Walk on water? Nah, neither did Jesus
It's a parable to make followers and readers believers
From Egypt to Budapest, Rakim is the truest left
Understand the Scriptures like the minister Louis F
I told you who God is, you ignored me like most the prophets
Jesus, Solomon, Abraham, Moses and Muhammad
I showed the scholars, we'll fulfill the broken promise
I spit this truth to predict the future like Nostradamus
Like Revelations, I'm hoping my quotes reveal
The seven spirits of God when I open the seal
Interpret the holy Quran, these flows will guide you
Translate the Torah, and decode the Bible
Warn the elders in the mosques, masons, and the law
The seven churches, the synagogues, it's the Renaissance
Skin is bronze, like the Messiah
Rakim Allah's 'bout to reveal a bigger secret than time and the God
Holy are you
Holy are you
There is no God but you (I want to challenge you)
There is no God but you (and soon I will challenge the talents of the Lord)
Praised be the Lord (I, I am the Alpha and Omega)
Rakim Allah
Peace"
12,How I Get Down,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"(Rakim)
Before the dough came, my whole aim, was blow like propane
Control the whole domain, and then show no shame
Make rappers go ? and they so lame, playin' with no game
Put 'em on the lil plane till they can't claim no fame
I got, the range, better, stay in the slow lane
I make the flow change from hurricanes to a slow rain
Your thoughts are so plane, I rearrange your whole frame
Until my whole name grow out your brain like Rogaine
Letter by letter, I put words together
Once merged, apart never, they be heard forever
And then I grab a pen and stab him in his abdomen
And smash him in, throw his mic like a javelin
Then I explain verses, that remain on the surface
At times it get deep, but I never defeat the purpose
Never go out, to go the dough route, forever hold out
I never sold out, for any amount, no doubt
Chorus: Rakim (repeat 2X)
That's how I get down, so tell me how you like that
I hit the town, hold it down on a tight track
I start a party now - everybody like rap
Haters are mad 'cause they gave the R the mic back
(Rakim)
I like to hang where e'rythang seem to happen at (y'know?)
It's Ra's habitat, I'm like that czar Arafat
And yes I have a gat, snap like a Israeli
A terrorist I never miss blowin' up kids daily
I step to writers, and let my virus hurt the closest
I'm sick as hepatitis and worse than tuberculosis
Pull out a pen, like a grenade, and drop it quick
I strike again and I'ma get paid, exotic shit
You know the God ra be, hot as the Mojave
Swing like King Usabi, my posse be kamikaze
On the corners like I'm homeless and I, don't know where home is
The bonus, is where the next open microphone is
Me and my team, vision like a radar screen
Intervene and yo, cut the mic off, cause Ra fiend
To show the whole world some of the things I seen
Then blow it up, like Edi Amin, yaknahmean?
(Rakim)
I do a thang thang, I write the songs they sing
Make sure that they swing, from New York to Beijing
Put your thoughts in the sling and your brain is gangrene
Pull in the ring, repeatin and sayin' the same thing
Xerox, zero, no match, you ditto
Copy machine, couldn't reprint my ??
My new style, that I produce now's beyond two-thou'
I knew how, since a juvenile, to make a ka-pow
When the night's fallin', I can hear the mic callin
I like ballin, I cut back like Mic Jordan
This is for y'all while I'm spittin' literatures
Lyrics'll ball like Allen Iverson dribble the ball
They hopeless - whoever approaches my high explosives
My vision sadicious, and freestyle's ferocious
I wrote this, words flew over my head like a locust
I turned the beat up, sat back, and stayed focused"
13,How To Emcee,2009,The Seventh Seal (2009),,Rakim,"Look what y'all made me do
This is your koran or bible
To be a true emcee icon or idol
The contents you put in your songs are vital
Like training for the ufc you want a title
Slam thoughts on a canvas flip 'em and pin 'em metaphors and similes and synonyms in em
Spit heat around the town the more you get it heard till you spit at 2000 miles before it hit a curve
Then flood your rhymes and your rap pages word play punch lines and catch phrases
Heat sports with players and ballers new game street talk straight off the corners new slang
I got heat for crowds for those that pursuit it
Spitters I show you flow till your vocals are through it
I m showing you freestyle just focus into it
If you a gee ill show you how to cope when you do it
Forever sick like catching aids is
In a class of greatness for magic phrases
My predicates last for pages every letter fit trend setter like fashion statements
My quotes get a shrine in the hood forever
I wrote some of the illest rhymes ever put together
Soon as I make 'em rappers take 'em analyze 'em for days and para phrase em
I'm back hip hoppers
I back my scripts and documents
Raps hit the block it's a wrap it's the apocalypse
The hood give my rap flow names like nine eleven and crack cocaine
I hit the building it gets hotter in em
It's like birds most rappers don't know how to flip em
I got hip 'em get hop and show 'em how to spit 'em I bust a rhyme then I school 'em for for free I scholarship em
Chorur:song the competition know the deal your not ready now
Because your dealing with the R know how it's going down this is it your so sick with your skills your flow goes right in you can kill rap
Its hard since you can flip it isn't it bars its infinite so ra deliver it far different
Hard lyric and part instruments start spitting the articulate y'all rhythms get
Till every syllable you drop is pivotal
It's not original it's not as memorable
Ill lyrical till hes so popular they sick of you
Pandemic a threat level five its critical
Kill 'em off with a word like euthanasia
Till it spread to the youth in asia
In the booth I'm major my music monumental I'm a mogul
You gonna make sense I'm gonna show you
You got to put the life in them lines make the deaf hear sight to the make your flow tighter brighter design
So if the mic is your grind then biting s a crime especially if a ghost writers writing your rhymes.
Chorus : it don matter if I ain't on the page
You gonna tell me what you want
I give it to you the way you want it show you how to flow and how to rip any phrase you you want you just keep your eye on me I show you how to emcee
If its wack ordinary displays you want tell what you want I give it to you the way you want show you how to flow and how to rip any stage you on I can show you how to emcee like I got a degree"
14,I Ain't No Joke,2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"I ain't no joke, I use to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the seen I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up convert it into hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration, 'cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tamed
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
Competin' 'cause I just put your mind on pause
And I complete when - you compare my rhyme wit yours
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me, the one you got your idea from
But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher
When you start to stutter that's when you had enuff of
Biting, it'll make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should've broke because I ain't no joke
I got a question, as serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack nobody smiling
'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all the hip-hop hits
Get the style down pat then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you fake it you're ready for the neighborhood chores
The E-M-C-E-E don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those 7 MC's
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns and paragraphs based on you and
Your offbeat DJ, if anything he play
Sound familiar, I'll wait till E say
Play 'em, so I'ma have to diss and bro
You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke
I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation 'cause when I invent
I nominated my DJ to president
When I'm see I'll, keep a freestyle, going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
They'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiending
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the middle of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the R so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
'Cause I'm moving the crowd and B'll wreck the fader
No interruptions till the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
'Cause everything is real on a serious tip
Keep playing and I varies quick
And take you for a walk through hell
Freeze your dome then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple stage darkness
When it get dark again then I'ma spark this
Microphone 'cause the heat is on, you see smoke
Then I finish when the beat is gone, I'm no joke"
15,I Know,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"(1st verse)
Aye yo, who's the most explosive one yet?
The a roundest one left
Who flows express to them rhythm drum set ain't done yet?
Flow like a trumpet to your eardrum are deaf
Who pose a threat?
Yo- who's more ferocious- none yet
To the night damn set mic trends and life ends
In sight, I see the whole world through a tight lens
Rhymes I write wins and kept a white Benz
Spend G's like hundreds and hundreds like tens
I get paid, Black, but laid back with mild manners
When I flip it's the opposite of dark Bruce Banner
Out the lab with soul and melodies in your ear
And just when it all seem clear I disappear
All you gotta do is holler
Reappear like vol-la the street scholar
I'm 40 deep like Ali Baba
Give the mamas something to talk about in the beauty parlor
Keep it hot like lava, yeah
It's Rakim Allah
I know you find it hard to believe that
I am the genie of the mic an
I can do anything you wish but
Right now I'm commanding you to dance
(2nd verse)
Ready to dance y'all, my magic carpet's the dance floor
Last chance y'all even if you can't ball
What part don't you understand? Your wish is my command
And I'm a rock a jam by popular demand
You gone love this, it's marvelous, baby
It gotta thug's twist-it start to get crazy
It's off the meat rack- can't keep my peeps back
Speak raps and I freak tracks for these cats
I got a fetish for puttin' together words and letters
It ain't all about the cheddars and y'all know where my head is
Ghetto scriptures for my little brothers and sisters
And still get vicious for the thugs and the Misses
What I don't do is talk about the same old thing
When I come through, I drop it, and they gone swing
I bring the ladies joy until they make crazy noise
'Cause the beat's bangin'- I'm born to blaze, baby boy
I know I you find it hard to believe that
I am the genie of the mic an
I can do anything you wish but
Right now I'm commanding you to dance
(3rd verse)
The editor-forever more the predator, I said it all
I spread a war, like never before
Spit lead at yours like a ghetto braud raw at a?
She'll never pause
With raw metaphors, I set it off
But I just begun the best is yet to come
Blessed with a majestic tongue since I was young
But I was stressed for funds and obsessed with guns
Test the one, let Allah protect your son
Cause something musical magician, the ageiathic author
The microphone magician when I have a magic marker, a mentor
You can explore, every sentence is a tour
The inventor is more than adventure
You'll be blown away, and a zone?
It's so ill, I still grab the microphone and say
One of my own displays like I'm known to blaze
And I bet rhyme pays until I'm old and gray
I know you find it hard to believe that
I am the genie of the mic and
I can do anything wish but
Right now I'm commanding you to dance"
16,I Know You Got Soul,2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker till you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
Your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul
You got it (4x)
I know you got soul
Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul
You got it (5x)
I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul
You got it (4x)
Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim'll say peace
You got it (10x)"
17,I'll Be There,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"I will always be there
I always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll be there
(1st verse)
I'm bout to meet my comrade on the busy Ave where we clash
Trying to see how much gritty cash this city has
Meantime harass every bitty that pass
And then here you come with your pretty ass
All petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street
Your for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete
You got your head on tight and when you talk I like
For me and you two different walks of life
I'm in the streets too much I pack the heat too much
Put too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch
You try to get in contact I don't respond back
Where the god at come back smellin' like cognac
Baby beware I'm tryin' my best to be fair
Aye yo-the key here is repair this love we share
'Cause if we care we would prepare to see clear
Eye to eye we here as long as you be there
I will always be there
I will always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll be there
(2nd verse)
Yo, I'm startin' to understand it you like your evenings enchanted
Love is bond, organic- restaurants romantic
Want me to take your hand and take you around the planet
But I take advantage and take you for granted
Call collect explainin' why I ain't came yet
I ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check
Blow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again
Don't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end
Talk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear
Make you role in your bed when your thug ain't there
Somewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud
Open my file baby you should know me by now
Tryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites
Find my place in life plus I like to hold mics
It might be seven whole days and seven whole nights
But yo it's gonna be all right just hold tight
I will always be there
I will always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll always be there baby
(3rd verse)
Who said something good won't last forever
I know too much of any thing is ìwhateverî
Long as we have good and bad times together
Bad times make the good times that much better
Peaches and cream, diamonds and ice
You like pieces of dreams you shinin' in the night
Features of a Queen and your mind frame is tight
Timin' is right get ready for the time of your life
You speak about stackin' gees and havin' seeds
Apparently we know it's no guarantee
But losin' you boo who smooth as you
You unusual this is for the cool in you
And for the chill I will forever come real
Your appeal makes it hard to keep my love concealed
All it took was one look, one kiss, one meal
Now come feel, let's make this a done deal
I will always be there
I will always be there for you
I will always be there
I'll be there"
18,Intro,1997,18th Letter (1997),,Rakim,"(Interviewer, possibly Harry Allen)

What they been waitin for yaknahmean? Umm...

20,It's A Must,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"(1st verse)
If I lay low and let the day go it'll slow my payroll
Aye-yo I'm a terrorize charge and slay shows
Ra slay flows go as far as the Barbados
On the turntable sound like tornadoes
My style is performed like tropical storms
Your not to get on the whole spot will get torn
I keep the metropolitan hollering and bring the dollars in
Keep the models following wise as King Solomon
Come slow through the jungle like an animal
Invade any land I go like General Hannibal
From Long Island to Queens light up the New York scenes
All the way to New Orleans and everything in between
Left to go bless a show in Mexico
Next Thing I know it's extra cold I see Eskimo's
Time to rock get it hot soon as I get in there
Spit in they ear so flow they froze and I disappear
It's a must that I bust any mic that you hand to me
It's inherited it runs in the family
(2nd verse)
They said I was a head of my time or either here before
To see the idea clear it takes a year or more
Now times that by the years I reign straight-seven
No hear for four years still multiplied by eleven
The silence's a set back make 'em regret that
One way to get back is violence and wet cats
But hold your head black or I'll never rap again
Just when I thought I was out they pulled me back in
Now that was two years ago and if cats start interfering
Then I'm a go back to the gat and racketeering
My sabotage is camaflouge and espionage
You ain't havin' Ra so don't test the god
I'm takin' all orders I can't afford extorters
I hit 'em in the head with a hundred dollars in quarters
So warn a friend tell 'em it's on again
If it's a freestyle bust in a park I want in
It's a must that I bust any mic that you hand to me
It's inherited it runs in the family
(3rd verse)
I managed to get paid for a decade now add three years on to that
Perform with a knack yes I was born to rap
The mic Lebanon Teflon don is back
I strike with better bombs and armed to attack
So reload the van go ahead let 'em in
Every tours a war and I'm on the road again
Suprise a town the place it's live and loud
We vibin' now I go wild and dive in the crowd
Never hit the ground they catch me and carry me around
Then put me right back on stage to shut it down
From New York to Cali, Japan and I-tali
I'm known as the microphone Muhammad Ali
I'm worldwide my brothers be biggin' me up
Keep the girls occupied lovin' diggin' me what
Ain't around when I come to town they mad glad
Like Saddaam they even say I'm the bomb in Baghdad
It's a must that I bust any mic that you hand to me
It's inherited it runs in the family"

Who wouldn't believe this I heard the word on the street is
I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas

'Cause new days is dawnin', new ways of peformin'
Brainstormin', I write and watch the night turn to mornin'

My only challenge, is not to explode in violence
I'm Asiatic, and blazin' microphones a habit
At least once during the course of a day, it's automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharaoh
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me
You know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi

24,It's The R,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"(1st verse)
Aye yo it's Mr. Low-key you need to go see
The host by far a mostly o.t., with a brand new show but
You know how the flow be.
'Cause when I swerve, you observe it closely
If you smoke trees, smoke more than an o-z.
Mix any kind of dope with me, you o-d.
You get the c-d, l-p c.o.d.
Poetry cause you to fully load the V.
Drop place to place be crazy over me.
Even different nationalities, over seas.
However do a don't emcee, you know me. G-o-d.
She know she d-o-e, so show me.
Even with no jewelry she call me goldie,
Like a Jacuzzi she overheat an o-g.
Like sushi swimin' in a open sea. I'm comin'.
(Instrumental Chorus)
(2nd verse)
She said it's the same since I came and rained it's still hard.
You can stimulate the brain, feel the god.
It's hard to go against the grain, it's real large.
Drive'em insane leave dames in silk bras.
Plus real cups spill, spill that bars.
What's the deal kids with Hennessey grills they feel charged.
And you know what time it is? It's still Ra's.
When I do a show real far they steal cars.
Stages of battle field reveal your scars.
Train hard, cause this is a game with ill squads.
Play with pain and gain a couple of yards.
And if you know the dreal, you can deal the cards.
And appeal to broads with jobs and ov-e-ods.
Body parts like buns of steel and spa's.
Then we can kick tha blahzay blah, smoke a cigar.
While I get ma-na-massage.
I'm comin'.
(Instrumental Chorus)
(3rd verse)
From the inner city to the suburbs, the street poet.
The most jiggiest kid with words, and peeps know it.
They've read about it and heard, plus TV show it.
So how do I reserve my swerve? I low pro it.
Now there eager to know just how deep the flow get.
I don't know yet, sometime the flow be so wet.
Spit a tech that will effect quicker than moet.
Or high as anything you smoke yet, go ahead roll it.
Any microphone I hold, my heat blow it.
My emo is make more doe till I can't fold it.
Anything I see or touch, I wanna own it.
Drop a jewel in baby girl ear, now she my co-ed.
I re-load and she keep the candy coated,
And when she know she can't control it.
She tell me she about to blow at any moment.
Well go ahead baby I can't hold it. I'm comin'"
25,Juice (Know the Ledge),2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"Sip the juice 'cause I got enough to go around
And the thought takes place uptown
I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk
And then taught to hawk New York
I go to Queens for queens to get the crew from Brooklyn
Make money in Manhattan and never been token
Go Uptown and the Bronx to boogie down
Get strong on the Island, recoup and lay around
Time to build my juice back up
Props back up, suckers get smacked up
Don't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about
Knocking niggaz off, knocking niggaz out
Shaking 'em up, waking 'em up
Raking 'em up, breaking 'em up
Standing on shaky grounds too close to the edge
Let's see if I know the ledge
Corners' trifling 'cause shorty's here
I get cock-d liffin' forty's of beer
Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased
If I get revenge, then they rest in peace
Somebody's got to suffer, I just might spare one
And give a brother a fair one
Stay alert and on ""P's""
And I do work with these like Hercules
Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw
'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall
Smooth but I move like an army
Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
Putting brothers to rest like Elliot Ness
'Cause I don't like stress
Streets ain't a place for innocent bystanders to stand
Nutting's gonna stop the plan
I'll chill like Pacino, kill like DeNiro
Black Gambino, die like a hero
Living on shaky grounds too close to the edge
Let's see if I know the ledge!
Shells lay around on the battleground
Dead bodies are found throughout the town
Tried to put shame in my game to make a name
I'm-a put it on a bullet, put it in your brain
Rip the block like a buckshot
Who cares where it goes, just keep the casket closed
No remorse when a life is lost
I paid my dues- paid the cost
And my pockets are still fat
Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat
Even if my crew steep with one deep
I attract attention, people like to peep
So come say hi to the badguy
Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die
'Cause I get loose and I got troops
And crazy juice
In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini
Hang out wit Smith and Wesson, don't try to play me
I'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat
But no warning shot, my gun is warm a lot
When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear
Areas in fear but this here's a fear!
Living life too close to the edge
Hoping that I know the ledge
A brand new morn, no time to yawn
Shower's on, power's on
Late for school, I catch the train
Girls sip, ""Cristal"" and whisper my name
I push up like an exercise
Check the intellect and inspect the thighs
Select the best one, pull her to the side
Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride
Read my resume she's know I'm 'ready cool
Just meet me after school
We can moan and groan until your mom come home
And you be calling me Al ""Dope"" Capone
Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose
Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice
'Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety
'Cause a lot of niggaz hate me
Coming out of the building, they set me up
Sprayed wit automatics, they wet me up
In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge
I guess I didn't know the ledge"
26,Mahogany,2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"Me and Eric B was coolin' at the Paladium
Seen a all-world covered girl, I said ""Hey lady I'm
Sorry if You're in a rush - Don't let me hold ya up
Or interveen or interrupt, but...
You got the look - I wanna get to know ya better
I had to let her know - but yo, I didn't sweat her
'Cause if you woulda seen what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean, but European.
When she spoke, her accent was self-explanatory -
Even her body language told the story
Her name was Mahogony - twin's name was Ebony
I said ""My name is Ra - and this is Eric B""
Since the music was loud, I said ""let's take a walk,
So we could talk and see New York.
Show time doesn't start until one o'clock
And once I entered your mind I wouldn't wanna stop
Caressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same
Calm ya nerves, massage ya brain
Each moment's a mineral, poetry's protein
Verse is the vitamin - Affects like Codine
So tell me how you feel and I'll reveal
A pill that'll heal ya pain - 'cause I'm real""
She musta OD'd 'cause she couldn't resist
She spoke slowly when she told me this, she said
Over Me, I'm goin' crazy
She'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy
She said she'd want my kids and help me make my next G
Tell me I ain't finesse Mahogony...
So I prescribed her something to revive and surprise her,
She's liver and much more wiser
From the light I shine when the brain cells spark,
Constantly so she can glow in the dark
Then soon, you can represent the moon
As long as I keep ya in tune
I'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here
Take it in stride 'cause it might take a year
It's funny - how time flies when ya havin' fun
We got close and it was almost one
She kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go
Fuck around and miss the show
So I told her to hold that thought real tight
We can finish where we left off later on tonight
Back to the scene of the crime on time
As they introduced the 'Fiend of the Rhyme'
She stood in the crowd with a birds-eye view of me
Thinkin' of later on of what she would do to me
The back of the room I could see her eyes gloom
Patient, but hopin' that the show was over soon
As the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row
So I said ""let's go""
I packed my mic as they screamed for an encore
The speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore
Besides I got places to go, ladies to see
And she could tell me how crazy she was over me
We drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed
And couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm', I said,
""I was watchin' you, watchin' me
Looks I received made it hard to MC
I can take a hint, so I knew that she
Wanted my ""Agony Agony Ag-on-y"" in her bod-y
Showed her some sights, then I took her to the Condo
She was pipin' hot, but I kept my calm so
She asked how come I don't smile I said, ""Everything's fine,
But I'm in a New York state of mind!""
As we reached the kingdom, she said bring some
Champagne, she'll entertain then sing some
Sentimental, songs real gentle,
It hit the spot and you know where it went to
As we embraced I felt her heart pumpin'
I knew she was in the mood for somethin'
So I laid on my back and relaxed
It wasn't the Perignon that made her collaspe
Over Me, she was goin' crazy
She'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy
She said she'd want my kids and help me make my next G
Tell me I ain't finesse Mahogony..."
27,Man Above,2009,The Seventh Seal (2009),,Rakim,"Ladies and gentlemen, ghettos all across the world
The man above been talking to me
He said he understands my view
He's always walking with me
'Cause he sees what I've been through
When the world starts kicking me around
All in my face, make me wanna put 'em down
Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands
I'm from the hood that's forever sinning
Where life is took for granted here so death is winning
Nothing but blues around, feels like we're losing out
Times that spent in this environment confuse a child
As a juvenile I ran wild, I ran out of blessings
Been in and out of prison as an adolescent
My goal was getting it 'til something said to turn my life around
Redirect my hustle and go legitimate
'Til I get corporate and invest fortunes
With exec bosses sitting behind a desk at the office
But I'm left jobless, nobody hiring ex-convicts
That don't mean I'm less conscious
It's so hard when they close doors
And when you looking like a so-called hip hoppa you get nada
Stereotyped, scarred for life stigmata
But still a kid's gotta get a dolla
The man above been talking to me
He said he understands my view
He's always walking with me
'Cause he sees what I've been through
When the world starts kicking me around
All in my face, make me want to put 'em down
Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands
I tackle choices every day that's hopeless
I hear a voice saying, ""Stay focused""
Fast money, cars and broads will mislead you
Love backwards here is evil but it's legal
Multi-task, I make a fortune faster
Keep rhymin' 'til I'm climbing up the corporate ladder
In my community, you've gotta go out of your way
If you're out to get paid than back up and wait for opportunity
I try not to blame society
I eat my pride 'cause I know deep inside it's me
But not entirely, when a man try to live righteously
And propriety turn to anxiety
I thought I paid back the system when I stayed in prison
I left the stripes, see what success is like
But the way they set the price
You spent your childhood in the wild hood you're in debt for life
The man above been talking to me
He said he understands my view
He's always walking with me
'Cause he sees what I've been through
When the world starts kicking me around
All in my face, make me wanna put 'em down
Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands
They say I'm from the hood
That mean I'm no good
I figured out what was talking with me
When I do right I feel him walking with me
So I'm adamant, some call it arrogance
I can cope it 'cause I know I'm broke for having sense
But my back's against the wall, it's getting rough to get a buck
In a job with a minimum wage won't get enough
Faced with giving up and my lady friend's beefing
Ends ain't meeting, we just an argument away from splitting up
It gets lonely, my fam disowned me
Called me the black sheep 'cause I act street
Yeah, it's that deep, I tried to change clicks
Homies flipped on me 'cause I don't hang we have beef
But I'm at peace so that cease, at least
I ain't got no ties on my Porsche ride
And no time for no crime, knowing that the most high
Is watching with a close eye
The man above been talking to me
He said he understands my view
He's always walking with me
'Cause he sees what I've been through
When the world starts kicking me around
All in my face, make me wanna put 'em down
Trying to earn, trying to learn, trying to love like a man
Sometimes it feels like it's out of my hands
They say I'm from the hood
That mean I'm no good
They say I'm from the hood
That mean I'm no good
They say I'm from the hood
That mean I'm no good"

Rappers crossed over they dead
I spit my verse with technique till they know when they ledge
First to compete then I'm over their heads

Every day from spiritual too criminal
It's a message in the bottle open it
It's a lesson in survival cope with it

Get that prop at night it's a lot of strife
My advice is don't get blinded by the lights
Drug money and blood money got a price
6 feet under or 25 to life
Do the crime and you might do the time you served it
What it's worth when you do a crime and get murdered
Time is precious it's time we earned
Its time to questioned your grind isn't working
It's time that we changed the game
We been waitin for change and exchange
Why play with death play it safe momma
And do your best to stay away

29,Microphone Fiend,2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
'Cause I grabbed the mic and try to say, ""Yes y'all!""
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab ...without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the other one, then I make another one
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, 'Cause it's sort of... an addiction,
Magnatized by the mixing
Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in
The mic is a drano, volcanoes erupting,
Rhymes overflowing, gradually growing
Everything is written in the cold, so it can coin-
Cide, my thoughts to guide,
48 tracks to slide
The invincible, microphone fiend Rakim
Spread the word, 'cause I'm in
E-F-F-E-C-T
A smooth operator operating correctly,
But back to the problem, I gotta habit,
You can't solve it, silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
Unawareness? Beware, it's the re-animator!
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assassinater, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiending for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend...
After 12, I'm worse that a Gremlin
Feed me Hip-hop and I start trembling
The thrill of suspense is intense, your horrified
But this ain't the cinemas of ""Tales From the Darkside"",
By any means necessary, this is what has to be done
Make way 'cause here I come...
My DJ cuts material...
Grand imperial.
It's a must that I bust any mic you're hand to me,
It's inherited, it's runs in the family
I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back,
If that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack.
Now I don't want to have to let off, you should of kept off
You didn't keep the stage warm -- step off!
Ladies and Gentleman, You're about to see
A pastime hobby about to be
Take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one-
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up
Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber
One on one and I'm the remainder!
So close your eyes and hold your breath,
And I'm a hit'cha wit the blow of death
Before you go, you'll remember you seen
The fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend
The microphone fiend..."
30,Move the Crowd,2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"Verse one:
Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause When I heard the beat, I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It simple ain't it but quite clever
Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause if not and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long 'cause I'm a move on
The dancefloor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd
Move the crowd...
Verse two:
Imagine me wit the heat that's made by solar,
It gets stronger every time I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving or eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut!
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric B is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise due to Allah and that's a blessing
Wit knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees, I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven,
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving
Move the crowd..."
31,My Melody,2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"Turn up the bass, check out my melody, hand out a cigar
I'm lettin knowledge be born, and my name's the R
A-k-i-m, not like the rest of them, I'm not on a list
That's what I'm sayin', I drop science like a scientist
My melody's in a code, the very next episode
Has the mic often distortin', ready to explode
I keep the mic at Fahrenheit, freeze MC's to make 'em colder
The listener's system is kickin' like solar
As I memorize, advertise, like a poet
Keep you goin' when I'm flowin', smooth enough, you know it
But rough that's why the moral of my story I tell E.B.
Nobody beats the R, check out my melody
So what, I'm a microphone fiend addicted soon as I seen
One of these four MC's so they don't have to scream
I couldn't wait to take the mic, flow into it to test it,
Let 'My Melody' play, then a record suggest it
I'm droppin' bombs, but I stay peace and calm
Any MC that disagree with me wave your arm
And I'll break, when I'm through breakin' I'll leave you broke
Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke
So stand back, you wanna rap? All of that can wait
I won't push, I won't beat around the bush
I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
You might try but you can't get close to
Because I'm number one, competition is none
I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun
'Cause I'm playin' ball or bobbin' in the hall
Or just writin my name in graffiti on the wall
You shouldn't have told me you said you controlled me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your money, pull out your cut
Pull up a chair, and I'm a tear shit up
My name is Rakim Allah, and R and A stands for Ra
Switch it around, it still comes out R
So easily will I e-m-c-e-e
My repetition of words is check out my melody
Some bass and treble is moist, scratch in and cut in a voice
And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice
I wouldn't a came and said my name and run same weak shit
Puttin' blurbs and slurs and words that don't fit
In a rhyme, why waste time on the microphone
I take this more serious than just a poem
Rockin' party to party, backyard to yard
I tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods
The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp
I can swing off anything even a string of a harp
Just turn it on and start rockin', mine, no introduction
Till I finish droppin' science, no interruption
When I approach I exercise like a coach
Usin' a melody and add new verse (?) and notes
So when the mic and the R-a-k-i-m
It's attached, like a match I will strike again
Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
Put in a order to pursue with the momentum except
I say one rhyme out of order, a longer rhyme shorter,
A pause, but don't stop the tape recorder
I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor
Melody arranger, poet, etcetera
Extra event, the grand finale-like bonus
I am the man they call the microphonist
With wisdom, which means wise words bein' spoken
Too many at one time watch the mic start smokin'
I came to express the rap I manifest
Stand in my way and I'll veto on the word's protest
MC's that wanna be vissed (?), they're gonna
Be dissed if they don't get from in fronta
All they can go get is me a glass of Moet
A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
I take 7 MC's put 'em in a line
And add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme
Well, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine
Now that's 21 MC's ate up at the same time
Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doin'
No fessin', no messin' around, no chewin'
No robbin', no buyin', bitin', why bother
This slob'll stop tryin', fightin' to follow
My unusual style will confuse you a while
And if I was water, I'd flow in the Nile
So many rhymes you won't have time to go for yours
Just because of applause I have to pause
Right after tonight is when I prepare
To catch another sucka duck MC out there
'Cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe
And after this you'll call me your majesty
My melody
Yes, my melody
Eric B.
Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorize it
Eric B. made a cut and advertised it
My melody's created for MC's in the place
They try to listen 'cause I'm dissin them so pick up your face
Shook off your neck 'cause you try to detect my pace
Now you're buggin', almost doggin' off my rhyme-like bass
The melody that I'm stylin', smooth as a violin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island
My wisdom is swift, no matter if
My momentum is slow, MC's still stand stiff
I'm genuine like leather - inclined to be clever
MC, you'll beat the R, I'll say ""Oh never""
So Eric B., cut it easily and
Check out my melody..."
32,New York (Ya Out There),1997,18th Letter (1997),,Rakim,"(From the movie Wildstyle
If you was born in New york City let me hear say ""You know that""!
You know that
Aiyyo, once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets, you see stress
Streets a matter of life and death, no regrets
Life's a test, strife, wit special effects
Neighbourhood's full of reps, cities are projects
Where the young cadets get stripes from the vets
And comrades quest to be the next, to finess
Collect debts and select bets with death threats
Object - Chedder, better your total net
Where trends are set from ways to express the outfits
Friends get wet tryin' to make ends connect
Avenues to check, boulevards to sweat
The smell of gunsmoke more common than cigarettes
WE GOT clicks for wreck
WE LIKE Pits for pets
WE GOT Giants and Jets, the Knicks, Yanks and Mets
WE LIKE much respect and sex extra wet
And High-Tech dialect you ain't catch yet
(The Bronx
Ya out there?
No doubt
Brooklyn
Ya out there)
(Rakim)
Aiyyo, we got blocks and glocks with
Big shots with big knots and big props
Yo this is where the bullshit stops
Where herbs get got
If you snitch you get shot
We get down and leave the town in a state of shock
WE GOT dangerous hang out spots and slick cops
Place called Riker's Island where kids get locked
A lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops
Styles are top notch, this is the place to buy
So bust the box the radio station is hot
Ease your mind staring at skylines from rooftops
Flip scripts for chips
And new Whips of the lot
Quick to call a shot, pollitic with thick plots
And the Garden of Eden against the sea that we got
To make sure the core of the big apple don't rot
Where seeings believing we be achieving a lot
Since disc jocks created hip hop, check it out!
(Queens
Ya out there?
No doubt
Manhatten
No doubt
New York city
Staten Island
New york new york
Long Island
New york
Ya out there)
(Rakim)
Aiyo, we got five bouroughs of ghettos
With amny places to meet, you get lost in city streets
The city that never sleeps
Mecca ? Medina the population increase
The desert and the oasis, New York, the far east
With gods and Sheiks
Pretty amazons for weeks
Player dons that fleece the family's black sheep
Icons that teach that we all act unique
We got stats to reach so we all have to eat
A mass of peeps, with they own masterpiece
The crafts elite, we going past the beat
The latest technique no other place get as deep
Who parks release some of the worlds greatest athletes
DJs and MCs and graffiti artistes
Who use walls and subway trains for marquees
We go back to b-boys, breakdancing, breakbeats
And it'll never cease and on that note
We say peace"
33,Outro,1997,18th Letter (1997),,Rakim,"(Interviewer, possibly harry allen)
What is, the one, main thing that you have
That you would want people to remember you by?
Or not one but the, those things that are dear to you
That you would, want to be remembered as
(Rakim)
I guess I guess it's my words man, yaknahmean?
Just my words, and, if people remember my words they'll remember me forever
Y'know? God by nature mind raised in asia, y'know?
But umm... it's like y'know to live forever you you you gotta
Set y'know, not not set trends but you gotta
Apply yourself a certain way and you gotta do certain things y'know?
Maybe, maybe when I'm gone twenty years from now
Somebody might be tellin', tellin' they little son
Oh yo you think shorty bad? yo I 'member this cat way back
In like nineteen-ninety. kid named rakim, bananas.
Youknowhati'msayin? if that can happen man, I'm aight man, y'know?
I got I got I got kids y'know? they gonna umm, finish this for
Me anyway yknahmsayin so regardless, y'know the legacy lives
But umm as far as the masses just remember my words"

This is a journey into sound
A journey which along the way will bring to you
New color, new dimension, new value

Thinking of a master plan
Def with record, def with the record
Thinking of a master plan
'Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I... start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking, ""How could I get some dead presidents?""
I need money; I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
(Coldcut scratches interlude 2x)
I used to roll up... roll up... roll up
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nutin' move but the money
But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great; so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistling this
Feeling out of place 'cause, man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money it's still a wish
'Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now to test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I'm paid in full

Turn the bass down and just let the beat keep on rocking

It's the paragraph ambassador
The wild style fashioner
It's the god Rakim, the master
Feel this
(1st verse)
This is that lost ass track off-the-rack kind of a track
You forced to rap, remember that? It's that
You know where I'm at, there go the gat
Pass me a bat, the kill-or-be-killed kind of attack
Steamin', speedin' navigatin' the map
Negotiating with a chick, she got her head on your lap, ya hand on your gat
Premeditated plan of attack, with two of your most deadliest mens in the back
Comb the block, stop in the zone that's hot
Get out like you own the spot, home or not
It's that no mood to play, move out the my way
Yo, I been whistlin' this tune from throughout the day
Hey, yo, this is that ol' y'all niggas don't wanna battle
Turn it up loud make the whole block rattle
Boom boom- this one is gettin' blazin' hot
Boom boom- make you bust another shot from the Glock
From the streets below to everything above
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues
From the streets beneath my feet to the sun
I'm number one and competition is still none
And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues
(2nd verse)
Here we come now
Turntable spin like a merry-go-round
Never slow down, depending on how good your stereo sounds
Set it, up in the hood where we go surround
Tearin' through towns, turn 'em into burial grounds
This is the track that made Theodore wanna scratch
The track that caused the first kid to spin on his back
And then we saw, kids spray-painting the wall
While some of y'all was waitin' for war breakin' the law
It's no antidote it's what you can't provoke
So just relax with your girls or your man's and smoke
And take a real hit, soon as it bang you feel quick
It's real thick, this is that ol' real shit
This is the description of designs for you to listen to
Reminiscin' the times and nothin' in particular
Keep you goin' just like a whole pot of coffee
Have you and your shorty doin' 80 in a 40
From the streets below to everything above
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues
From the streets beneath my feet to the sun
I'm number one and competition is still none
And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs
(3rd verse)
You know what this is
Yeah kid, give up your riches
Vicious, visions is not for motion pictures
Unstoppable, rollin' witcha sickest clique of niggas
Or witcha missus, gettin' tropical kisses
Makin' faces, anticipatin' places her tongue hits
Suck her neck or just peck, better to funk it
The EP is in effect from dusk to sunset
She want a rim shot all over her drum set
Jump the bed rubbin' your head- it's rough sex
50 ways to keep a love wet
Down and up the steps with crazy positions left till she upset
""Damn, baby, you ain't come yet?""
Hell, no- doomstick big as a elbow
Gel soft, well blow, give him a minute, he'll grow
And all you gotta do is play the track again
I'm ready and revived, baby, back again
From the streets below to everything above
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues
From the streets beneath my feet to the sun
I'm number one and competition is still none
And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues
(Canibus)
Yo!
Check it, Yo!
I'm faster than leopards running across the vast desert
In twenty-two yards per second to catch me to daily delicatessen
It takes me thirty minutes to eat'em, forty minutes to digest'em,
And fifty minutes for it to pass through my intestines
So ask yourself a question?(What question?)
Can the Canibus rhyme?
Is a fuckin' porcupine half swine?
No time to make up your mind, you wanna run or die?
Clip you while you're running by, trip you up from behind
My rhymes, confuse niggas
Like somebody try to gang-bang
Wearin' a blue shirt and red pants, throwin' up signs with there left hand
Standin' out on the corner of wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband
God dam eggplants, niggas getting' me vexed man
'Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sav
And I can't seem to get away from it
I dreamed that I stabbed leviathan through the stomach, and ate from it
In my past life I slayed hundreds, and in the life before that
I played trumpets, to warn you that I was comin'
There's one billion ways to die, and I already tried
Nine-hundred million nine hundred and ninety nine
When I aim and fire my rhymes, like a hundred cannon balls flying
Striking you one at a time, in a parallel line
While the art of emceeing is steady dying
Canibus and Rakim Allah is still in there prime!
From the streets below to everything above
To the heart that pumps Ra-kim Allah's blood
I swear I kick a hole in your speaker and pull the plug
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues
From the streets beneath my feet to the sun
I'm number one and competition is still none
And I'm gonna keep kicking holes in your speakers and pullin' plugs
You emcee's is playing tug-a-war with your tongues"

Turn the beat up, I get lost in the mind come across
The rhyme kick my feet up, then I find myself in time
I was on a train, destination Marley Marl's domain
I entertained things'll never be the same
DJ's are conveyed if the label OK it
Teddy Ted and Special K was the first ones to play it
On the radio, with the crazy flow
I pay dues until it pays me dough to do a show
When I'm at the helm I cover the whole realm
In control and leave your soul overwhelmed
Another influence of beats and instruments
Lyrics make it intricate and elements are tense
When you was playin' Pac Man it was the jams I packed
Peeps would swarm when I was perform in, black I'm all that
Back before they turned hip-hop to rap
It always a place to party at, remember that?
I remember the spots that used to be hot
Just like the roof top, a place that only few can rock
On a wild ass block, yeah you find me there a lot
Until you hear gunshots, that's when the fun stops
Here come the cops, time to go home, get in order
'Cause I'll be back in Manhattan if somethings happenin' at the Latin Quarter
House of havoc when it came to fourteen carat
And if you had it yeah kids'd try to grab it
It's cool at the Red Parrot we was doin' it there
I was the first one to rip it at the Union Square
Me and DJ Red Alert did work
A crazy concert, a lot of kids got hurt
I did encores at the Encore, they wanted more
I kicked a freestyle till I heard the crowd roar
Like the Funhouse, Bronx Center never endin black
Place to be was the Brooklyn Armory, remember that?
Remember that? (3X)
Open the door, let the crowds in, over twenty thousand
Wildin music's loud and microphone's growlin
Tickets are sold out, parties is packed and on tour
Rippin basketball arenas back then
Even afterparties, posses of players and hotties
Everybody was Gotti, spreadin bucks like shotties
Spendin cash, to make a good time last
Thoughts that I had give me a blast of the past
Memories of unforgettable times on my mind
Dollar signs and melodies and incredible rhymes
The people I met, and the sets that got wrecked
All the mics I checked, most of all life's effects
And peace to all the people I grew up around
In the streets back when beats had a rougher sound
I used to be wild me and my crew sit back and we smile
Keep piles of pictures filed in case I go senile
Cause some things are just too good to be forgot
Like your neighborhood block or your favorite spot
Certain records always seem to make me reminisce
And when it hits, and then it clicks, remember this
My life flashed before me I'm there from the sounds
I hear pinpoint the year, it's perfectly clear

I bag it up and get it crackin' in clubs, go on tours like I'm trafficking drugs

Who want musical narcotics, they all got it, bomb product will sure profit when y?all cop it
Any hood or any city I'm pumpin in, any slum I'm in, my custom is come again
Spit flow by the boatload like a Columbian, my shipments go out then bring the money in

DJ's cut it, let the streets step on that, still a hundred percent pure King Heron's back
I got a 'bout a million Mami's that call me they ex love 'cause I kept 'em ex thug and F'd up like sex drugs
They never come down futuristic high; I leave em, spaced out so they can kiss the sky
It's like Budda, Mami's say, man is he blessed Pac to push a man in a vest
They won't relapse no indeed he's back, my rap flow natural aphrodisiac
I'm a key to a user, piano to a dealer, liquor to a alcoholic to smokers a piff of chocolate
The gospel, for the ghetto so spit the gossip, is he Moses to drugs, either way it's a profit
Call me your drug lord, spit commandments you hooked, it's the King pin every day I get a book
Playing my surveillance tapes, I'm hot on the streets, even cops on the beat they call copping the heat

To uh, come back and and get embraced
That's that's like the best part y'know?
Bein bein gone for a while y'know
Walk through the streets
'Yo Ra yo when you comin' out, you gotta come out'
This and that
Y'know, so y'know I always want to come back
Had little setbacks, but umm
To comeback and get embraced man, that's the best part"

What you wanna say to make me stay awhile
What you wanna say to make me wanna stay
(Repeat 2X)
Just me and my peeps we gettin' buzzed, lookin' for clubs
Misses with kisses and hugs, lookin' for love
She gotta be nice with hers, even with cookin some grub
Once I'm in I meet her friends, then I'm hookin my thugs
We'll be blowin' hundreds, always knowin' where the fun is
Roadrunners findin more spots than Columbus
Pocket full of phone numbers from some of the world wonders
I take my time, and find where the right one is
Smooth as jazz but more than a half, ready for math
And on a steady path, like Betty Shabazz
And when I see the wiz I'ma step to my biz
And there she is, let's see if she pass the quiz
It's appropriate we go get soakin wet
Toast, we met, become close associates
The place is ours by now I can embrace your style
So much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile"
44,Still In Love,2009,The Seventh Seal (2009),,Rakim,"Hey yo every time hear some real hip hop man I start thinking... yo I""m still in love man ...listen
I'm in booth like prison
Lid like lift
If music's like woman
I'm whipped like a nymph
I love to keep it pushing
Like the basement speakers
Love hearing real hip hop and making heaters
Born entertainer
Armed with the flamer
If they bust shoots with it
Come on it's the blamer
Got the place to lose it
Booth shaking to it
True gangster music
Screwface included
Macho lingo
The beat'll remind you
Of the quatro cinco
Or cinco de mayo
Put it in your car
Turn the sound sky high
Ra down the block sound like a drive by
Keep chicks moving
Heat keep them open
Put 'em in the mood and they leave something broken
D.J set the scene to it in the club
Sound track to the hood theme music for the thug
I told you I'm still in love baby
Beats drop heavy every rhyme one ton
Streets not ready hurry nine one one
Spot gets frantic
Too late to panic
The meteor they can't stop from hitting the planet
Sodom and Gamorah
Sadam and Osama
The horror without the bomb and no llama
Spitting at a show performing
Vocals are swarming
Flow overflowing like it's global warming
I flood the market out
I'm over your head now
Roll the carpet out
The droughts over and dead now
When I kill a track
The true story the cause of euphoria
The thrillers back
Next flow level
Hip hop lover
Dress code ghetto
Lit vibe cutter
Just an artist trying to rep the hardest
And make history so not even death can part us
It's love
I'm still in love baby I'm still in love
It's the god Rakim
They know I get it (in)
They pull me back (in)
I'm going back (in)
Spitting fire
Ghetto music
Getting higher like a drug therapeutic
Hooked like an addict
Strung like sex
Look I got to have it
It alleviates stress
Quick as marijuana settle in the brain
Needle hit the record like heroin to vein
Blood start flowing
Adrenaline rush
Love start jonesing
School yard crush
Ra still feining still emceeing
More deals and geeing
Broads still screaming
It's that dude here's that sick
Spit that jewel
Talk that (shhh)
And wait till the lights go off the show start
That's when it's time for Ra to go hard
I told you I'm still in love
Always was"

Yeah... uh... yeah..."
46,The 18th Letter (Always And Forever),1997,18th Letter (1997),,Rakim,"What, uh, yo
Just when things seemed the same, and the whole scene is lame
I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains till things change
They strain to slang sling, I'm trained to bring game
History that I arranged been regained by King James
Go to practice, with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics
Women that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's
Stacks of mathematics took the ?ego-a-geatics?
As I find out, what the facts is, for geographic
No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is
I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers
While you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious
And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses
Shine permanently only my mind's concernin me
Fire burns in me eternally time's eternity
Followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary
Determinely advance technology better than Germany
Since the first days you know of, till the last days is over
I was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah
From a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom
Some of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn
From the ancient Hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures
I study I know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious
Date back I go beyond check the holy Qu'ran
To speeches at the altar on, now we get our party on
So being benificent, I bless 'em with dialogue
They expectin, the next testament by the God
I blow 'em through battlezones with chrome for chaperone
Blast beats with saxophones one of the baddest rapper's known
Every country city and borough, sidestreet and ghetto
Isle and alley and meadow theories ferile enough to echo
When it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man
And the whole mass was ran under one master plan
Since the world's metamorphis, and the plan is kept in orbit
Turntables we spin off but the needles never skip off it
Rhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors
It'll answer your questions if you understand the message
From the days of the slave choppers?, to the new age of prophets
As heavy as hip-hop is I'm always ready to drop it
From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs
And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme
The 18th Letter, the prophesy professor
I stay clever, long as the planet stay together
Bring up praise from Mecca, make a phrase for the better
In new days to remember, always and forever
(Repeat 2X)
The R baby"
47,The Mystery (Who Is God?),1997,18th Letter (1997),,Rakim,"If you can see if you can solve the mystery
The answer revolves around your history
So carefully
I drop this degree
Scientifically and realistically (Who is God?)
In eternal blackness in the midst of the darkest night
Proteins and minerals exist within specks of light
Solids liquids and gases and sparks of light within
Infinite lengths and widths and depths and heights
No beginning or ending, the seven dimensions
Enough space for more than a million words and inventions
To travel through time within enough room to be the womb
Of the most high's great mind which he will soon make shine
With intelligent elements in sight that he will gather
In the realms of relativity electricity struck matter
Energies explode he below to keep releasin
Atoms by the millions, till the numbers increasin
Till it was burnin he kept returnin itself to the source
The hotter his thoughts it gave the center more force
He gave birth to the sun which would follow his laws
All caused by his mental intercourse, who is God?
He began to explain his craft, the master in the attic
He dealt with measurements his language, was mathematics
His theoretical wisdom of the numerical system
The complete number nine which means born or existed
He gave birth to all planets, inorganic, and organic
So you wouldn't take it for granted
They rotated they own distance around the sun
And fully submit to the existence of one
And each one was promised everlasting perfection
If each one keeps spinnin in the same direction
To the East, and each speak the motion of peace and harmony,
And each show devotion to teach
The universe is to come, the whole world must go according
Know your galaxies and mirages stars start fallin'
So stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound
Like the planets each cipher remains perfectly round
From unconsciousness, to consciousness
By knowledging his wisdom his response is this
A understanding, which is the best part
He picked the third planet where new forms of life would start
He pursued show and prove every move in order
Back to the source he let off his resources in the water
Climb his climax, where the climate is at, high degrees
See he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas
And the plan is, to lay in the clays to form land
And expand, usin' the same clays to born man
In his own image our origin begins in the East
Culture rise to breed, with the powers of peace
Deal in equality nature's policy is to be God
Build or destroy positively born life like Allah
And each one was given everlasting perfection
If each one keep living in the same direction
And life was life, and love was love
We went according by the laws of the world above
They showed us physically, we could reach infinity
But mentally, through the century we lost our identity
Life start and ending, we got trife and started sinning
Lost touch with the beginning now ciphers stop spinnin
And what was once easy became confused and hard
Which brings us back, to the mystic question, who is God?
Sixty-six trillion years since his face was shown
When the seventh angel appears, the mystery will be known
Check Revelations and Genesis, St. Luke and John
It even tells us we are Gods in the Holy Qu'ran
Wisdom Strength and Beauty, one of the meanings of God
G.O.D. you and me Gomars O Dubar?
Knowledge Wisdom Understanding Sun Moon and Star
Man, Woman and Child, and so is Allah
Bear witness to Allah, gave birth to all
For Allah was all, and therefore, life itself
And the universe gave birth to man
The universe was man, and man was the universe
And the universe was always existed
And existence was life
And life is Allah
And Allah had no beginning because he is, what always was
Rakim
Allah, peace
Now who is God?"

50,Uplift,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"(1st verse)
Levantore!
Yeah, it's just ghetto, kid test the devil to hit the next level
Wish they was a rebel with cerebral metal
Inflex the bezzle with the peddle to the metal
In a thug's paradise where love have a price
So we love for life like thugs love the night
They sell drugs for ice for the Benz with bug lights
Some hug mics to the world, hung like parasites
The likes lethal, the mics lead you
A sneak preview, watch what we do and what the hood teach you
I still see through the eye of a needle
So I can watch people cause slug backwards is evil
(2nd verse)
Levantore!
Yo, what's this? Yo bust this. Yo it's time to up lift
They think all we do is bust clips and puff splifs
And plush whips and clutch chips and touch chicks
Flont rocks like Fort Knox and hog blocks
Taunt cops with more props and we want not
Panhandling with your man's and them
Scrambling, gambling, plans to win
While the cops clock em, thieves flock em
Women watch em, traders wanna top em
Ay yo what's the problem
Before the narcs knock 'em opposite playas plot to rob em
The ghetto got em, my man said it's rough at the bottom
(3rd verse)
Levantore!
Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
We went from 1st to America's worst
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth
There's more prize for one another, and call shots
12:00 till the next ball drop
All year around plus they shuffle non stop
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me
And everybody's side of the street'll be celly
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty and burn money
And earn money and watch the century turn 20
(4th verse)
Levantore!
We all should, from the woods to the big city and the small hood
Everybody should be welcome to the ball if we all could,
But we fall 'cause we brawl, yo it ain't all good
We need to play right, stay tight with ya air alight
Keep your game tight, no need to play trife
Get cheese from the daylight to the late night
And it's shouldn't take death to appreciate life
Before a lot parish, we got to cherish if Allah let us
Let's give prop and merits till the block flourish
In this metropolis, stay on top of this
You know what the prophet is, be prosperous
(5th verse)
Levantore!
Now we networking
Respect the next person, it'll be less hurting
Or left lurkin, while we kept our dreads working
Connect set for certain, total networking
Last chance to advance and stash grands
If you have plans to have fam and mad land
Own shine, condone crime or hold 9s
I know what the problem is, killing our own kind
To my flame throwers, train sober, remain soldiers
Stay sane so these pretty dames can hold us
Terror terrain rollers and Range Rovers so the train goers
Claim your fame, maintain, till your game's over
(6th verse)
Levantore!
Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
We went from 1st to America's worst
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth
There's more prize for one another, and call shots
12:00 till the next ball drop

51,Waiting For The World To End,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"(Rakim)
Yeah, it's the god Rakim
Word up, I'm blazin' this out to all my comrades
Yanamean? From the slums of New York, to the gutters all over the world
This is for y'all...
Through my travels I try to take righteous steps
Because right or left could mean life or death
No matter how trife it get, my sights is set
But it's twice the threat when the ?nights is death?
My mental windows refuse to close, they get exposed
To the neighborhood info where the poison wind blows
A deadly plague spreadin negativity, viciously
Unto every city be in ghetto misery
Don't let it get to me, the writer be left to die
But it get mesmerize if it catch your eye
Shines enormous, from pure revered Kool's and garments
But it's torment, jealousy drug wars or warring
Tallying, slowly turnin' into barbarians
More scary when the whole boulevard's carryin
Livin' in the world of sin, my ghetto girls and men
Waiting for the world to end
""Tryin' to paint a perfect picture and excel""
""In case you didn't know""
""Never movin backwards"" [Rakim]
""Complicated"" [Rakim]
""Know what I mean?"" [Rakim]
I see destruc-tion, even little kids trust none
They bust guns, that's what they get a rush from
When I see em, we build and have a real discussion
""Yo Ra, what's the jewel of the day?"" ""What up, son""
""You got ambition?"" Shorty said, ""Man listen
I got demands for livin', can't stand division
Make grands on my mission, till everything glisten
Women in the Expedition, no plans for prison
In a vision the city get, 2 millenni G
Sittin' in my MSC sippin Hennesy
Gettin' high, and watch life pass me by""
So I asked him why, wit a fast reply
He said ""I'm livin' just to die without any feelings
So I wait here for my Maker till it's time to go
Wit this dime I know
Wit all of her girls and all of my mens
Waitin for the world to end""
Shorty was taught to keep his head to the sky, and never cry
But the streets left him to die, now it's death in his eye
Livin' a sin of hitmen, a sinister grin
From be-ginning to end, in it to win
Evil rebels, doin' what we doin' in the ghetto
Thinkin' if we was thorough we can deceive the devil
You can't win, your life be end, try again
Shorty said, ""Why we born again to die again?""
That's what I said when I realized I had a gift
To uplift and be one of Allah's advocates
Teach the youth and speak the truth
Show 'em what peace can do when ?ill? reach for you
And my reward won't be jewels or cheese, it's even better
I can be one of the greatest MC's ever
If I tell 'em they intelligent women and great men
And live, stop waitin for the world to end
""I'm ragin, rippin up the stage an'
Don't it sound amazin, know what I mean?"" [Rakim]
""Don't it sound amazin, know what I mean?""
""Rakim"""

La-da-da-dah, la-da-da-dah
La-da-da-dah, la-da-da-dah (Uh... yeah...)
(This is for the haters... keep hatin')
La-da-da-dah, la-da-da-dah
La-da-da-dah, la-da-da-dah
(It's what we call money music, right here)
(Uh, yeah, let's go in)
(Rakim - Verse 1ne)
I perform in cities, hoods, and slums, the best seller is drugs
And money is the only thing that get love
They say don't let it make you, but that's how they rate you
And the more you got, the more they hate you (That's okay too!)
Just don't get in the way, 'cause at the end of the day
My agenda's make sure I get them ends to get paid (uh-huh)
So I'm stackin grands till the math expand
It's the man with the master plan
Since the Bambino, cash made my path cross with evil
Uno dos cinco on a crowded corner rollin' c-lo
To chips and the chick in the casino pourin Cliquot
'Cause now I make music for the c-notes
From New York to Puerto Rico, California to Rio
Hit the streets like the kilo but I'm legal
It's swga like I walk with heat though with all my people
But it's just me and my alter ego
(Chorus: Tracey Horton)
I walk these streets, wit my mind on my plan
It's all right if you don't understand
I walk these streets, think like I got a gun in my hand
'Cause hatin' is the nature of man
(Sometimes I wanna, stop the cameras, just pop the hammer
Box the innocent bystander and his man up)
I walk these streets, think like I got a gun in my hand
It's all right if you don't understand
Just stay outta my way
(Maino - Verse 2wo)
Mainooooo~!
Yo, one for my comrades, two for my family
Three for the day that I run into my enemies
We gon' make a movie, the world gon' remember me
I survived it all dawg, what the hell you tellin' me?
I remember days when, I was young and aidin
Cuttin' class, chasin ass, couldn't pass grades and
Chillin' on the block then, listenin to Rakim
Back of his album filled up with Killer Ben
Supreme Magnetic and I wasn't athletic
But I ran around with the Tre-8 Magnetic
Money on my mind, crack vials in my Levi's
Been a dog since I had the cream colored Filas (Hahahah!)
Yeah, yeah, we fly, seen it all with these eyes
Gunplay and drugs if you put my mind on rewind
Fast forward my life, ya boy done MADE IT!
If I could do it over, I wouldn't CHANGED IT!
(Rakim - Verse 3hree)
(Ay, good lookin' out my dude)
Aiyyo Maino, it's the same ol' same ol'
Don't matter if you in it for the fame or you lay low
Haters gon' hate but, it's okay though (Keep doin' what you ddo)
The angle is make sure the payroll stay swoll
Big faces, cake dough and di-nay-ros
Rubels, yen yang, euros and pesos
Seven digit figures, tryna make more zay-ros
Spray holes in whoever in the way so (Stay outta my way)
While I count the next bundle (that's right)
""All means necessary,"" Malcolm X hustle
A threat yet humble, about to flex muscle
Get a big amount then I'm in and out the next jungle
'Cause every other day, I'm in another state
It's like I cross the thin line between love and hate
But I gotta eat, gotta get another plate
So I'm on my cake walk for the cake
Just stay outta my way...
(It's what they do..)
Just stay outta my way..."

(It don't stop)
Yeah
Check it out

Come on
We love to flirt
To chase the skirts
Get to know who we are
Girls in the park
'Cause when we in the club
We keep it extra hot
They love the whips the chicks
The neighborhood superstars
Boys on the block
Thugs in the hood we don't never stop
Never stop
I go where the masses go
We all act natural
Think rational
Those some blow (?)
Cats have to know
Master your craft
Stash your dough
Stay on the low
But never be the last to know
The next level or plateau be international
The grass'll grow
You know
Cash'll flow
Ask a pro
Do the math
Get it fast or slow
Your girl's passin gold like a fashion show
The sun'll shine
Make it feel like the summertime
Shorty's runnin' blind
Lookin' like they just done a crime
Click's want they pockets thick
Cop a
Proper chick
Street scholarships
Politic your dollars quick (?)
We
'Cause we was the first in the pack
They say ""herb's a trap""
Now it's worse than that
So I observe the
Let my words attack
Until it the rap
Until the earth collapsed
You know it seem like life's just begun
My lust is young
I wanna find me a lovely hon
Crush me one
Bust a
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
Let her hug
And when I'm done
Tongue touch me till I'm numb
But first the outcome is income and then some
Get enough to run and spend some for fun
Then me and my thugs
We come in the club
We swung lovely
Watch how big the buzz be
Trust me son
Every ghetto got game in it
Fame in it
We remain in it
Waitin for the main event
Like the days on the corner
We watch the world go by
On the nights that wasn't right
Like when a good friend died
Yo the street's got a deadly hum
Like a drug
We gotta find a way to fill the neighborhood with love
From the park to the block
To your favorite spot
It don't stop
I spend the prowl (?)
I been on since a child
It don't make sense to browse
It's intensive now
Women in crowds
I search for the gem in the
Who stay original
Even when the friends around
Since her style
Always commands a smile
And her femme fatale
Cause men to growl
I take precedent of principle (?)
Then arouse (?)
Still the treasure is rakim
The smooth criminal
Damn, it's on
Keep my hands on
This amazon
Legs for marathons
Voice like sarah vaughan
Precise, all right
I like when her entice
With a spice of life
Flow times twice as nice
And when she go shop
The show stop
Shock the whole block
She so hot
I clothes shop
Put it on lock
Body that won't drop
Bounce like hip-hop
It don't stop"
54,What's on Your Mind?,2008,"The Archive: Live, Lost & Found (2008)",,Rakim,"I seen her in the subway, on my way to Brooklyn
Hello, good looking, is this seat tooken
On the A-train, picking at her brain
I couldn't get her number, I couldn't get her name
I said I still like your style of fashion
But I hate your hostile, 'itty attitude wit a passion
Is it because brothers like to hawk a lot
Is it because your sign don't talk a lot
She turned away, no play, I said ok
You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day
Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight
I was thinking of the rhymes I wrote last night
Next stop was mine, a familar scene
I was meeting my friend, killer Ben in Ft Green
Where the girls are real, they tell ya how they feel
If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel
See I don't bend and I won't rust
And I don't break and I won't bust
Stomped up the street and did I hear a treat?
Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete
I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me
Did she live in the area, was she trying to find me?
Hm, I didn't want to play myself out
I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guinness Stout
Now was she shy, she didn't walk by
She came in the store then she even said hi
Curiosity- at a high velocity
Maybe possibly she had the hots for me
I said if we're playing games then we're gonna play mine
I'm a lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time
If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find,
I want to know what's on your mind
About a week went by and I called her, ""Hello""
I said yo, can I speak to, um, she said no
Hey yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't want to stress you
Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you
See I want to get to know you so I can show you
What a strong relationship can grow to
But you gotta trust me and you're gonna love me
Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me
Now how does it feel when my mental, massage ya temple
Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you
Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions
Next you see ectacy's explosions
Now I'm coming to see you to spend some time
I'm a romantic warrior but is it a crime
And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find...
I want to know what's on your mind
I want to know what's on your mind
Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely
I'm in your head so you'll be thinking of me
So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams
And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen
But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown
How do the 125th street sound
Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo
Probably be watching Bill Cosby tomorrow
Then after that get into it, I mean intimate
Every word is an instrument
Making sounds and tones and songs and moans
My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones
You smile, you said you never know what the day will bring
It's always a new song to sing
The next day I went back to the her rest
Knocked on the door, intentions: finesse
She let me in and had nothing but a neglige on
Smelling like Liz Claiborne
I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables
She sat next to me and said what's up wit you
I got the feeling for sexual healing
A mental healing ; how you feeling
She caught the effect and said she feel the same
Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain
Desire's yearning, the fire's burning
You hot 'cause it's a lot you're learning
Now I'm ready to explore you inner world
It's take a long time 'cause I'm just beginning, girl...
Take it easy, cut off the TV
Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me,
Use your physical form if I'm hard to find
'Cause now I know what's on your mind...
'Cause now I know what's on your mind..."
55,When I B On Tha Mic,1999,The Master (1999),,Rakim,"(DJ Premier scratches hook)
(Hardcore... real ill niggas)
(I'm internationally known)
(When I be on the mic)
(Hardcore... real ill niggas)
(I'm internationally known, yo)
(Hardcore... real ill niggas)
(I'm internationally known)
(When I be on the mic)
(Hardcore... real ill niggas)
(So all hail the honorable)
It's to my real ill niggas, heavyweight hitters
Dough getters, fifty ways to make figures
My niggas, that come on the spot to feel sisters
Like they hear real spitters and kids on the zigga-ziggas
When it's ugly, then the club is lovely
Thugs be sipping Henessey and bubbly
To my comrades that keep it flaming hot
On dangerous blocks, claiming spots
Where the goal is to be one of the top-ranked soldiers
Forty-five holders, one of the high rollers
Get respect in the hood, credit is good
Knock it down lumberjack style, baby, extra wood
Rock it all night long, the bang-a-thon baby
Keep hanging on, we like it with the lights on
Don't have to blow twenty thou' to get to know honey's style
Show her the town, steal her heart, no money down
How about some hardcore, yeah we like it raw for sure
Broads on the floor, wall to wall
There's more at the door, players ball to score
'Cause this right here is for all of y'all
Rakim and Primo, yo I got what you need bro
You go see a show, smoke an L, mean yo
And deejays play hits with hard bass kicks
And then they display tricks like The Matrix
Make the record fly undetected by the naked eye
So just feel the vibe 'cause your ears never lie
Nowadays deejays bags of tricks, graphic
On some behind the back shit, catch it and scratch it
Classic, this kid got his craft mastered
Hands is mad quick like he mix with magic
Spin it back and forth and grab it, and know just where it is...
There it is
To my elite peeps with the murderous mystiques
I hit the streets with beats and they critique for weeks
They be like ""How that kid Ra reach the peak?""
Pull out the heat and use my technique to speak
It's dangerous, sit calm and explain to kids
What part of the game this is and foreign languages
They hold Ra's events in different continents
Put my lyrical contents in monuments
In ghetto garments, I rock a towel like a pharaoh
Mind travel, design style like apparel
My fashions last long as a lifetime
'Cause I can see the future when the god write rhymes
They're mad 'cause I managed to reign so long
Like their chance to get money done came and gone
This is strictly for my listeners on the corners at night
And the sisters that be keeping this right, when I be on the mic"
56,When I'm Flowin,1997,18th Letter (1997),,Rakim,"Yes yes y'all, check it out y'all (repeat 2X)
Chorus: Rakim
(Yo) I find a show, rhyme till it's time to go
I'm designed to blow, my mind's inclined to flow
Yo, my M.O., makin' all kind of dough
From the info that Rakim show, y'know?
Verse One: Rakim
Yes yes y'all, I still fiend by any means
To flow, and I go through extremes don't intervene
My adventures show like a three dimensional screen
'Cause I mention many things and I'm presentin many scenes
Guess I'm telegraphic, motions energentic
Better tell 'em forget it, 'cause I'm telekinetic
Crowds is screamin, I choke the mic and keep squeezin
Styles seemin like I used a thousand words without breathin
Bustin' techs like Russian Roulette I doubt you win
Freestyles like hand grenades without the pin
Composin, then leave the mic full of corrosion
Don't test this, or best to expects this explosion
At shows I spit flows with seven deadly venoms
Killin' syllables with poisonous synonyms in em
Ideas is blowin', mics is blowin'
From what I'm showin, see it, I keep it goin' when I'm flowin
Verse Two: Rakim
When I'm flowin, theoretically speakin' like a drummer
I take you through the streets to the parks in the summer
Or illustrate, a time and place you never been in
And make you focus on the future after seein the beginning
And my style wilds, like Miles on the trumpet
Volume dial was kind of low, need to pump it
Up another notch turn the dial till it stops
More watts you got, more things to watch
Third eye's wide open, you're focused on the theory
Keep scopin till you hear me, words is spoken clearly
It's no smokescreens on the scenes that I'm showin
Man I keep it goin', damn I keep it flowin
Verse Three: Rakim
Two pages cause panic, freestyles is frantic
Thoughts is organic, flow is aerodynamic
Mic is volcanic, rhymes spread across the planet
I send out the scribe now the vibes gigantic
Now, I'm internationally known, mental capacities blown
I hope your microphone's accident prone
Raw footage is shown, but only showin scenes of my own
Leavin' your periphereal vision in a zone
But not the twilight, from the insight that I write
And recite, in my mic'll be bright, 'cause I like
The night glowin', it's out of sight when I'm showin
Man I keep it goin', damn I keep it flowin
Verse Four: Rakim
Yo, accurate tactics ""Make Em Clap to This""
When I ""Move the Crowd"", my ""Rhythm"" still don't miss
Breeze through melodies cause ""It's Been A Long Time""
My ""Lyrics"" is ""Fury"" and rappers hate to hear me rhyme
Every antidote that I quote, is ""No Joke""
Nobody's smilin' ""In The Ghetto"" from the notes I wrote
My high techniques wreck and disrepect beats
Have you ""Follow-in The Leader"" up and down the streets
So ""Kick Along"" as I rip a song with pull
As the rhyme goes on I get ""Paid In Full""
It's Rakim, I'm indicatin rhymes for the showin
Check it out y'all, I keep it goin' when I'm flowin
Straight up, Rakim Allah the Fiend of the Microphone still flowin
You know? One love to ? comin' through your livin' room soon, straight up
?, One love
The whole tri-state, one love
Rakim Allah baby, y'know?
It's on, what, check it out y'all, check it out"
57,Won't Be Long,2009,The Seventh Seal (2009),,Rakim,"Rakim - talking]
In the words of the late, great
Martin
Luther
King ""How long?
Not long"" ...
Won't be long, uh huh
Uh, uh
Sing along [Chorus -
Rakim] (Tracey
Horton) - w/ ad libs (It won't be long, till the trouble and the struggle is gone
The hustle make the struggle get gone)
It's hard to make a move, we strugglin
Everybody hate to lose but they love to win (It won't be long, till the world sings the words to our song
That way we forever live on)
Back on my grind, I'm hustlin
It's just a matter of time and I'll come up again [Verse 1 -
Rakim]
They told me hustle never prolong
But I got caught up in the struggle like a slow song (uh huh) 'Cause my love and respect for this is so strong I question the state of hip-hop (uh), major labels, etc. and so on (uh)
The show'll go on, still fiend to get my blow on
But if it's like this, then I might quit
But hold on (uh), this can only go wrong but for so long (uh huh)
Get right quick or I might flip
Try to keep a tight lip, not to complain
Ramblin, mind scramblin 'cause patience ain't blockin the pain (uh uh)
Mic sick, lyrics is still locked in the brain (uh huh)
Like
Mike
Vick sittin' in jail watchin the game (uh) I wait till the day I can play my position (yeah)
Or should I say the die I obey my addiction (uh huh)
Then complete my legacy (uh)
Without compromisin my artistic integrity (come on) [Chorus] - w/ ad libs [Verse 2 -
Rakim]
So when they ask where I go from here (go 'head)
The road and the goal is clear (uh) but it's so severe (uh)
Sometimes I feel like lettin go, I swear I had setbacks my whole career (straight y'all)
Messin with my grind's like messin with my mind
But yo, I'm still breathin, so I guess it's just a sign (uh huh)
But it's meaning to the message in the lines (word up)
Some things happen for a reason like a blessing in disguise
But success was in my eyes, the shine was blindin me
The fame, a little bit of change, it took some time to see
The lesson for the wise, profit more
Time to be a record and the prize was poppin' off
Finally I made a couple of moves, got my own label (got to get it)
Me and a couple of dudes, we at the dope table (let's get that money)
Took a oath to stay true, now it's an empire
Put out the new
Rakim album and it's fire [Chorus] - w/ ad libs [Verse 3 -
Rakim]
Feel like I'm back where I belong when I'm in the booth (uh)
Produce and perform at my pinnacle (uh huh)
Speak the truth in my songs and my interviews (the truth)
For the youth and my dons and my women too (uh huh)
Guap insisted, watch your business with a drama dunn (get that money)
Hustlers is where we get persona from
Gotta get it, not just wish a dollar come
We optimistic since
Obama won
But these days of recession
We ain't safe yet (uh huh), pray, a paycheck away from the
Great
Depression (uh)
Major stressin but we wait for blessings
Long as the
Federal
Reserve still paper pressing I wrote the plot for gettin' this cabbage in the hood
Where the average cat can triple his status in the hood
Don't stop, till we livin' lavish in the hood I'm like
Barack with
The
Stimulus
Package in the hood [Chorus] - w/ ad libs [Outro -
Tracey
Horton] - w
Rakim ad libs until fade
It won't be long, till the trouble and the struggle is gone
The hustle make the struggle get gone
It won't be long, till the world sings the words to our song
That way we forever live on"
